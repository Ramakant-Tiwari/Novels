If someone was making her feel this way, it had to be an enemy.

But who?

He didn't know.

"I never thought that taking a small nap would lead to the death of one of our fellow cadets."

Lumine and the rest turned to see Vergil approach, yawning with a lazy smile on his face.

He seemed relaxed—too relaxed—as if the death didn't matter to him at all.

"Do you have any clue what might have happened?"

Celestina asked, not out of suspicion, but because Vergil seemed more knowledgeable about the mind.

He had managed to get one of the Dark King clones to himself without laying a finger on it, and Cadet Kanae's death felt connected to something that might have corrupted her mind.

But to everyone's disappointment, Vergil shook his head.

"I don't, sadly. I was asleep when I woke up to some of you screaming. More importantly, where is Azriel?"

"He climbed down to scout the area beforehand."

"And that was a good idea? What if something happened to him?"

"Instructor Kevin is down there with him."

"So? Look at them."

Vergil said, gesturing toward the instructors.

"They have no clue what's happening, hence the interrogation. What if something similar is going on down there, putting Instructor Kevin and Azriel in danger?"

Jasmine's face darkened.

It wasn't that she wasn't worried—she was.

Especially now, more than ever.

But what could she do?

Abandon everyone here at the possibility they might die like Kanae to save Azriel?

She would.

But she wanted to believe that Azriel could handle himself.

Vergil's eyes shifted to Yelena.

"Ignoring the problem with Azriel, what's up with you? Forgot your jacket?"

"Apparently, someone dangerous is watching her every move."

"Oh…"

A look of understanding crossed Vergil's face upon hearing Lumine's explanation.

"Can't blame 'em."

Lumine felt his lips twitch.

If he could, he would have liked to punch Vergil for how casual he seemed, but he couldn't—not yet.

"Is this some sort of private meeting? Am I allowed to join you guys?"

Once again, a voice interrupted as another figure walked toward them.

Everyone turned in surprise, recognizing someone they all knew in one way or another.

Jasmine grumbled as the person stopped in front of her.

"Finally done lazing off... Nol?"

Chapter 90: No Time to Look Back [2]

"Haa… haa..."

Azriel was tired.

Exhausted.

He ran.

He didn't stop.

He couldn't.

If he stopped…

Everything would be for naught.

He would die.

And have to redo everything.

Which he desperately didn't want to do.

The heat was torture.

The black dunes stretched endlessly, littered with bones.

The invisible sun, hiding behind the blinking stars, felt like molten lava on his skin.

The more he pressed forward,

the worse the heat became.

And…

He was exposed.

Watched.

Eyes were everywhere.

Yet none dared approach.

They knew that to do so would mean death.

He couldn't see any of them either.

Azriel was not their prey.

No.

Azriel was its prey.

The Cradler.

He was wrong.

The Cradler didn't care about the fire.

It didn't fight other void creatures, nor did it get distracted.

It wanted only one thing.

Azriel.

Nothing else mattered.

"Damn it all…!"

Azriel cursed.

His heart pounded furiously in his chest.

No matter how much his legs ached, he kept running.

Because…

The Cradler was behind him.

The humming followed him, soft and relentless.

It drifted on the air, gentle at first, like a lullaby meant to soothe.

But each note swelled, rising above the thud of his footsteps, sweet yet suffocating.

The hum grew clearer, more tender, as if it were calling him back—beckoning him to stop, to surrender.

It was too soft, too kind.

And the closer it came, the heavier it felt, pressing against his mind, sinking into his bones, urging him to slow down.

"Ah gods, what have I gotten myself into!?"

He glanced back.

Azriel risked a glance—and instantly regretted it.

"...!"

His blood ran cold.

The Cradler glided over the black sand, its skeletal form barely grazing the ground.

Long, emaciated arms cradled a swaddled bundle close to its hollow chest, while its head, too large for its fragile body, lolled slightly to the side.

Pale skin stretched tight over sharp bones glowed faintly in the dark, like a sickly ghost under a dying moon.

Its face was shrouded in shadow, yet the outlines of deep, hollow eye sockets locked onto him with unrelenting focus.

The creature's too-wide mouth quivered in a twisted smile, humming its warped lullaby as if to soothe a child—only now, it was chasing him, and the distance between them was closing.

Despite its slow, drifting movement, the Cradler seemed to be everywhere at once, its humming filling the air, making the very sand beneath him feel heavier.

The swaddled bundle in its arms shifted, as if something within was alive, and for a brief, horrifying moment, he imagined that whatever lay inside was watching him too.

"Time is ticking, Azriel... No time to look back. You better hurry!"

"What the—? Argh!?"

Surprised by the sudden voice beside him, Azriel stumbled through the sand.

Chills ran down his spine, but he quickly regained his footing and sprinted onward.

His startled eyes darted in front of him.

There stood a person.

He was just… there.

Yet every time Azriel blinked,

he appeared further away.

Smiling.

"As if my day couldn't get any worse…"

Azriel scowled, pushing himself to run even faster.

Leo laughed lightly.

Azriel felt dizzy at how Leo kept appearing without moving.

"We haven't seen each other in weeks, and this is the first thing you say? How rude."

Ignoring him, Azriel noticed the humming growing fainter.

'Did it lose me?'

Gritting his teeth, he glanced back.

The Cradler wasn't there anymore.

His legs began to numb, and with no other choice, he ran toward a massive rock.

He couldn't stop in time, tripping and collapsing onto his back.

"Hooo... hooo…"

He struggled to catch his breath, staring up at the blinking stars, his view suddenly blocked by Leo's head, which loomed above him, smiling.

"Should you really be resting here? You don't have much time left. The attack will happen any moment."

Azriel's face hardened.

"You must have had a lot of fun looking through my memories."

Leo nodded.

"Indeed. This time, I made sure to look at everything—past and present. Seriously, you're an interesting individual, unlike anyone I've encountered."

Leo glanced at Azriel's arm.

"Even after all this time, I couldn't figure out what that tattoo of yours means… No," he shook his head, frustration seeping into his voice.

"I did figure it out; it's better to say I've forgotten. I can't seem to keep it in my mind… how annoying."

Azriel stared at him wearily as Leo's eyes locked with his.

"Still, I didn't think you would quietly let me sift through all your memories."

A dry laugh escaped Azriel's lips.

"Why bother? Your life is temporary. You miscalculated my strength. It's not like I needed to do anything, even though if I had, it would have been too difficult."

Leo's smile faded, replaced by a somber expression.

"Indeed. But who could blame me? I barely had enough time back then to implant this inferior version of myself in your mind because of that Solomon and had to run away. You really piqued my curiosity, you know? I devoured so many soldiers back in Europe, yet they were all so… boring. I thought you were just another lost kid."

"…"

"But who would have thought? You were indeed lost—lost from your world and ended up here, in a supposed world from a book. Isn't that funny? That we're all just a bunch of letters brought to life in your eyes?"

Leo crouched down, his face inches from Azriel's, his smile darkening.

"You are so weak… I could have killed you right then and there. Just showing your little sister from that world of yours was enough to break you. Ah, but that wouldn't be any fun, would it? I was curious about what more I could learn from you… what more you had to offer. I'm glad this version of mine was enough to at least read your memories."

'…He will retain all his memories from this version…'

This was bad.

"So, what are you going to do now?"

Azriel was beginning to regain his energy but stayed down, curious.

He still didn't hear the Cradler's humming, meaning he was safe… for now.

"I'll see how this unfolds. Will you fail? Succeed? After that… I will be gone. This version of me, at least."

"…"

Suddenly, Leo's hand reached for Azriel's neck, and Azriel didn't move.

Leo's hand passed through him, leaving a cold emptiness.

"…I will come for you. The real me. You've taught me a lot, Azriel—shown me things I didn't think were possible. For that, you will be my ultimate meal."

A shudder ran down Azriel's spine.

Alarm bells rang in his head.

His face turned grim.

Every part of him screamed that...

he had created something that should not exist.

Leo stood, arms spread wide, a maniacal grin stretching across his face.

"The boy who does not belong in this world! There will be no greater head to feast upon than yours!"

"Fucking psychopath…"

Azriel gritted his teeth, standing up.

He was done listening.

At that moment, the humming returned from behind him, worsening his mood with every passing second.

So he started running again.

"Remember, Azriel. You are mine alone—body and mind. No one else will take your life except me… After all, you and I are meant to be one."

*****

What felt like hours of running, enduring the relentless humming while the Cradler chased him, finally led Azriel to his destination.

Perhaps it was best that the Cradler was behind him—because no one else dared approach.

Before him stood an ancient circular platform, reminiscent of the first floor where the Dark King resided.

"…I wonder who made such a thing."

Leo's voice echoed, but Azriel ignored the remark, taking a deep breath.

"Hooo..."

'Here goes nothing…'

He stepped forward.

The moment he did, the platform's ancient runes flared to life, glowing as the ground split open, revealing a gaping maw—a massive staircase spiraling downward.

'Fuck, it's almost here!'

Without hesitation, Azriel ran down as fast as he could.

Pain shot through his feet, screaming in agony, yet he pressed on.

He was close.

Everything ahead was cloaked in darkness, the humming growing nearer, more insistent.

Azriel's heart raced, threatening to burst from his chest.

When he finally reached the last step, a burst of light illuminated the chamber.

Torches lining the walls flared to life, revealing what looked like an abandoned tunnel, long forgotten by time.

He bit his lip, slowing down just a bit.

The Cradler was already starting to descend the stairs.

'Ah, shit! Come on!'

He moved with a desperate pace that was neither walking nor running.

He had to be careful here.

The possibility of void creatures lurking in the shadows was guaranteed, whether they feared the Cradler or not—he had no way of knowing.

He felt trapped.

No matter where he went now, nowhere was safe.

At least the tunnel was dry.

The flickering torches offered little illumination, casting long, eerie shadows that danced on the walls.

It felt like he was walking blindfolded.

'I'm a psychopath, just like this bastard for doing this…!'

In a way, it was slightly comforting having Leo next to him—thankfully, he was silent.

The thought of having to listen to his voice again would have driven Azriel mad.

The tunnel was wide enough for two streets to be built within, making it feel both grand and suffocating.

Azriel didn't dare look back.

The humming maintained a steady pace, neither getting closer nor further away, which meant one thing:

the Cradler was just as cautious as he was.

He couldn't decide if that was good or bad.

The tunnel stretched endlessly, warping his perception, distorting time as he walked—and kept walking—for what seemed like hours.

He lost count after ten thousand footsteps.

He wasn't alone in the dark.

He felt the gazes of what felt like thousands of void creatures piercing through the shadows.

Yet, once again, none approached.

But…

This time, it felt different.

The humming gnawed at him, tightening around his mind like a vice, urging him to stop, to rest, to surrender.

But he didn't.

And finally, after what felt like an eternity, the tunnel came to an end.

For the first time in what seemed like forever, Azriel smiled—a strained, almost desperate smile.

He stopped.

The humming grew closer.

But it was okay.

Because ahead of him lay something far more dreadful.

Chapter 91: Unbalanced [1]

When Celestina warned Azriel that the second floor was unbalanced, she was right.

But she had no idea just how much.

Azriel did, though.

Of course he did.

Lumine had come here alone once and discovered something—something that almost cost him his life.

The abandoned tunnel on the second floor was random, unknown, and undiscovered, lying in the opposite direction from where the floor boss resided.

The only way Azriel could reach this place was by heading east from the strange rock he had mentioned to Kevin before they departed together.

It took him several tries to navigate here, and the Cradler chasing him didn't make it any easier—except for the other void creatures, which were too terrified to attack.

"I already knew this place existed because of your memories, but... seeing is believing," the fake Leo remarked, gazing ahead alongside Azriel with a solemn expression.

An undiscovered part of the second floor.

The humming grew closer, reverberating through the air like a malevolent heartbeat, yet Azriel remained rooted in place.

He hesitated.

Because ahead of him loomed an abyss.

Darkness.

A true void.

The torches that had once flickered in the tunnel ceased where he stood, and nothing before him was illuminated.

But there was no other way to go.

It was either step into the darkness or face the Cradler—and he wanted no part of either.

Yet, he had no choice.

From the very beginning, he had planned this.

The Cradler was merely an unexpected variable.

But it shouldn't matter; as long as his plan worked, he would rid himself of it.

A crooked smile curled on the hateful figure beside Azriel.

"Tick-tock, tick-tock—better hurry and decide which path to gamble your fate upon."

Azriel clenched his fists and took a deep breath, his throat dry as he licked his lips, trying to moisten them.

The heat didn't reach him here, yet he felt sweat trickling down his face.

'...Here goes nothing.'

He stepped forward.

And then another step.

And then one more.

And then...

Everything turned dark.

His vision vanished.

He could see nothing anymore.

Perhaps he could have looked back, but his instincts screamed at him never to do so.

Azriel pressed onward, the humming growing louder, more insistent.

Yet he knew—the Cradler would hesitate, just as he did.

He felt unbalanced, taking each step slowly and carefully, afraid he might fall.

And if he did, he might not hit anything at all—only fall forever.

He focused on his breathing, trying to slow his racing heart, calming his nerves in the oppressive dark.

The path was suffocating, disorienting his senses, twisting reality into a nightmare.

"Wouldn't it be funny if you got lost here? The prince wandering eternally in darkness, trying to find a way out. That would make a good bedtime story."

Leo's voice echoed mockingly to his right.

But when Azriel glanced over, he couldn't see his face—only shadows dancing in the dark.

Gritting his teeth, Azriel kept walking forward.

Then the humming stopped.

Azriel didn't know whether to feel relieved or not.

'I need to hurry...!'

The hair on the back of his neck stood on end.

He quickened his pace.

"...."

After what felt like an eternity of walking, as if hours had slipped away once again, Azriel's feet and legs screamed in agony.

Yet, amid the endless darkness, he finally spotted a glimmer of hope—a chance to escape.

Regaining all his vigor, Azriel dashed toward the source of light ahead of him.

As he reached it, his breath caught in his throat.

"Ah..."

"Well, this is certainly a sight worth dying for..."

Before him lay a colossal cave, its sheer size dwarfing everything he had encountered in the depths of the tunnel.

Standing on a bridge as wide as the tunnel, Azriel was momentarily disoriented by the stark contrast of vibrant light pouring in from the cave's mouth.

The bridge, crafted from ancient stone, was worn and cracked, etched with strange, indecipherable runes.

Stepping forward in awe, Azriel leaned closer to examine the runes.

"Ugh!"

A sharp pain throbbed in his head as he strained to focus on the symbols.

He turned away, moving cautiously toward the edge of the bridge.

His blood ran cold.

Beneath him lay an endless void—a bottomless chasm that swallowed all light and sound.

Azriel's heart raced; the void loomed like a gaping maw, a haunting reminder of the depths he had escaped.

It was a chilling parallel to the path that had led him here, a dark abyss that seemed to beckon him closer.

Azriel's eyes narrowed as he looked ahead.

The bridge ended at a colossal gate, eerily similar to the boss gate on the first floor.

But this one… this one was different.

The gate didn't just lead to another boss room.

No, it led to the third floor.

But it wouldn't be easy.

Everything comes at a price.

There were no free passes in this world.

Azriel's brow furrowed.

'Why is nothing happening?'

It was too quiet.

Far too still.

His stomach churned uneasily.

Something didn't feel right.

The silence was unnerving, as if the air itself was holding its breath.

Azriel's face darkened, frustration simmering beneath his skin.

Too many things were slipping out of his control.

He walked toward the gate, half-expecting the worst.

When he reached it, he wasn't surprised to find it unyielding.

No matter how hard he pushed, it wouldn't budge.

The most irritating part?

The same cryptic runes etched into the gate, making it unbearable to look at.

Each glance sent a sharp throb through his skull.

"Where's the supposed guardian…?"

According to the book, there should have been a guardian here, just like the floor boss on the previous level—one that protected the gate to the third floor here.

But he was alone.

Except for Leo.

Azriel bit his lip, anxiety gnawing at him.

"Don't tell me... everything was for nothing—"

His words caught in his throat.

A chill ran down his spine.

His eyes widened, locking onto a figure emerging from the darkness, from the same tunnel he had come through.

A figure that made his entire body shudder in fear.

"Well, now you're really screwed."

It was the Cradler.

There was no escape.

He was trapped.

The Cradler stood there, silent, its twisted smile spreading across its face.

The usual humming was gone, replaced by a sick, twisted enjoyment of Azriel's fear.

It relished his helplessness.

Azriel's heart raced.

His plan had been to let the Cradler and the guardian fight, then take out the survivor when they were weakened.

But now, there was no guardian.

No guardian to save him.

The Cradler took a step forward.

Azriel took a step back.

Another step forward.

Another retreat.

Until his back hit the gate.

Void Eater appeared in his hand.

'Am I really going to fight this thing?'

He didn't want to.

Not now.

Maybe, by some stroke of luck, he could defeat it, but it would cost him everything he had left.

And after that?

He'd be too weak to face whatever came next.

'How much time has passed?' Azriel's thoughts raced.

His body was screaming for rest.

He hadn't truly slept or recovered in what felt like days.

The Cradler came closer, each step deliberate, savoring the moment.

Azriel could hear his own pulse in his ears, the heavy thump of fear.

There was no other choice now.

Just as Azriel steeled himself to strike—

Xiu—!

An arrow tore through the back of the Cradler's head, the tip emerging from its forehead.

Azriel froze.

The Cradler did too.

Xiu—!

Xiu—!

Xiu—!

More arrows ripped through the Cradler's body, black, viscous blood leaking from the gaping wounds.

The Cradler staggered, but it wasn't dead.

Not yet.

It turned slowly, a twisted snarl curling on its lips.

But before it could react, a sword flashed through the air—too fast for the creature to see.

A clean slash across its neck.

Its head rolled to the ground with a sickening thud.

Azriel stood motionless, his mind reeling.

He couldn't believe what had just happened.

His eyes darted toward his unexpected saviors.

A small group of people emerged in his vision.

"Looks like it's finally show time."

Four of them were clad in black uniforms, their presence unnerving in its precision and coldness.

But then someone stepped out of the darkness.

"...Instructor Benson."

"...."

Instructor Benson's narrowed eyes locked onto Azriel.

"Cadet Azriel... where is Instructor Kevin?"

Azriel didn't answer.

Instead, his gaze shifted toward the others.

Their uniforms made it obvious—they were military.

One held a bow, another a sword, the third a spear, and the last, an axe.

"Instructor, who are these people?"

Azriel asked, though he already knew the answer.

Benson grumbled, clearly annoyed at being ignored, but let out a frustrated sigh.

"The void dungeon trip has been cancelled, Cadet. Instructor Alicia returned to the surface and reported sudden, dangerous changes on the floors. She warned that lives were at risk. And when you didn't return with Instructor Kevin on time, we organized a search party. We're lucky we tracked you down in time..."

Benson's eyes fell on the Cradler's headless corpse, his expression grim as he turned back to Azriel.

"So, let me ask you again—where is Instructor Kevin? Shouldn't he be with you?"

"...."

Silence.

The air, already thick with tension, grew heavier.

Azriel didn't answer, his expression unreadable as his thoughts swirled in his mind.

Time seemed to stretch unbearably between them.

And then...

"...I killed him."

Chapter 92: Unbalanced [2]

Celestina watched quietly from the sidelines, observing Lumine in conversation with Yelena and Vergil.

Jasmine, on the other hand, seemed to be scolding Nol for reasons unknown.

She didn't join them.

She couldn't.

Her mind was stuck on Kanae's death.

Celestina hadn't known the cadet well, but they had spoken once, briefly, because of Azriel.

And now, Kanae had died under her leadership.

The weight of it crushed her, yet the circumstances made no sense.

'White eyes, blood leaking from her mouth, that smile… mind control?'

But how?

She hadn't noticed anything.

None of the instructors had.

Not even Jasmine.

Her gaze shifted to Benson and Alicia, the two instructors interrogating the cadets one by one.

Her brow furrowed as she glanced at Kanae's corpse, now concealed beneath a white cloth.

Quietly, Celestina stepped closer but stopped a few feet away.

'White eyes, blood from the eyes and mouth, smiling… she was being controlled, or attacked… but why did she die?'

Her eyes drifted to the edge of the cliff.

Walking towards it, she crouched down, staring below.

'Was she trying to kill herself?'

Celestina shook her head.

'No, she still died even after she was stopped. Unless… was it necessary to jump from the cliff? Or was she trying something else?'

She licked her dry lips, tucking a loose strand of silver hair behind her ear, the blinking stars above glinting off it.

Then, she froze.

Her eyes narrowed.

'Was she going somewhere?'

The thought struck hard.

Had her killer made her attempt something, only to kill her when it failed?

A chill crept down Celestina's spine.

Suddenly, she felt it—the gaze.

The gaze that Yelena kept sensing.

It pierced through her, a presence watching, tracking her every move.

She couldn't place it, but it was everywhere at once.

Her face darkened.

'Is it someone among us? Or… something else?'

Then, it vanished.

She exhaled, realizing she had been holding her breath, but the unease didn't fade.

Rising slowly, Celestina glanced around.

Nothing had changed—everyone and everything remained the same.

But whoever—or whatever—had been watching her was skilled.

Skilled enough to evade her senses.

Time seemed to slow as she scanned each face.

No one appeared suspicious.

No one acted abnormally.

There were no sudden symptoms like those that had plagued Kanae.

Then, another gaze.

Her eyes darted to Instructor Benson.

He was watching her with his usual stoic expression as he stood beside Alicia.

He nodded slightly before turning and walking away.

Further from the cadets.

The interrogations had stopped, and Celestina, confused, made her way to Alicia.

As she approached, Alicia forced a smile, though the atmosphere was too heavy for any real warmth.

With a death so unexplainable and the strange phenomena in the void dungeon, happiness felt impossible.

"Cadet Celestina, can I help you?"

Celestina nodded, her gaze drifting to the retreating form of Benson.

"Where is Instructor Benson going?"

Alicia sighed softly.

"We're pulling back from the expedition. He's heading to the tunnels to reach the base of the cliff… to find Cadet Azriel and Instructor Kevin."

"I see…"

Celestina nodded in understanding, her eyes still on Benson's distant figure.

'I hope he's alright.'

She wasn't sure how much time had passed—it had to be over a day, longer than Azriel had promised.

Normally, she wouldn't worry with Instructor Kevin by his side, but there had been too many abnormal occurrences.

'I'm surprised Jasmine hasn't lost it yet…'

She glanced at Jasmine, who was now listening to Nol, the latter attempting to explain himself with an awkward laugh.

'How strong is he really?'

Something about Nol didn't sit right.

Her instincts told her he was hiding something—he couldn't just be ranked in the top 200.

Sighing, she cast one more glance at Benson before turning away.

But then, she stopped.

Sweat dripped down her chin, hitting the ground.

The gaze was back.

She couldn't place it.

And just as swiftly as it came, it vanished again.

Celestina's heart pounded.

'What the hell is going on?'

Turning, she saw Alicia walking towards a group of cadets, oblivious to the strange tension.

Celestina's eyes instinctively followed Benson's path once more.

'Wait…'

Her breath trembled as she glanced around.

No one was watching her.

No one seemed to notice her growing distress.

And then, she followed Benson.

*****

Azriel found a slight amusement in the expression Instructor Benson made.

Though Benson's face barely shifted—his eyes narrowing, brows furrowing—Azriel still caught his bewilderment, which made the moment a tiny bit amusing to him.

"...What did you just say?"

Azriel's amusement vanished at the sound of Benson's shocked voice.

He let out a long sigh.

"It's as I said, Instructor. I killed Instructor Kevin—stabbed him in the back. Pierced his heart and throat. He trusted me, and I betrayed him."

The moment those words left his mouth, the air thickened.

It became harder to breathe, as if the atmosphere itself responded to the weight of his confession.

Benson's face remained still, but Azriel knew.

He was angry.

"It's funny, isn't it? Betrayal never comes from the enemy… only from those you trust."

Leo, lurking behind Benson and the others, grinned.

No one could see or hear him, anyway.

Azriel ignored Leo's taunts.

But he still heard them, and it worsened his mood.

A sudden smile crept back onto Azriel's face as he locked eyes with Benson.

"You should've seen the look on his face when I stabbed him. Gods, the shock... he never expected it. In his final moments, all he felt was despair, hurt, and betrayal—because he trusted one of his students."

Benson's brow furrowed further, his fists trembling with barely contained fury.

"You… you're lying..."

Azriel tilted his head slightly, his smile widening.

"Lying?"

His voice dripped with mockery.

"And what proof do you have that I'm lying?"

"..."

Benson's lips pressed into a thin line, his stoic expression cracking with each passing second.

The others around him began to look at Azriel with suspicion.

Azriel's smile faded, his eyes narrowing.

"Is it so hard to show me proof? It's funny how you accuse me of lying when, let's face it, aren't we all liars here?"

"...What...?"

Azriel sighed again, sounding almost bored.

"Fine. You want to make this difficult? Let's make it easier, shall we?"

Without warning, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small device.

On its screen were six red dots.

"!!"

Benson and the others froze, eyes widening in shock.

Azriel tossed the device onto the cold ground.

The sound echoed in the silence.

"Are you still going to lie to me?"

Benson's gaze trembled as he stared at the device.

Azriel's eyes swept over the group, meeting each man's gaze.

"And seriously, you lot should never consider theater—or auditioning for any movies. You're not even qualified to be background extras. Pathetic, really."

The four men looked bewildered, trying to process his words.

Leo whistled from behind them.

"Damn, you really hit them where it hurts."

Azriel twirled Void Eater in his hand, a playful smile curling his lips.

"What? I'm right, aren't I? You all followed me blindly to this place on the second floor. Did you really think I didn't know about this bridge? That I came here by accident? Seriously, did you even stop to think for a second that I knew about all of this all along?"

His gaze locked onto Benson, whose eyes were now red.

Whether from sadness—sadness over his friend's death—or rage, Azriel couldn't tell.

Maybe both.

"All of you belong to Neo Genesis."

"...."

A deafening silence followed Azriel's words.

No one spoke.

Everyone's expressions grew serious.

Instructor Benson closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before exhaling slowly.

When he opened them again, the red in his gaze had dulled—he looked calmer as he fixed his stare on Azriel.

"...So, now what?"

Azriel raised an eyebrow, confused by the question.

"We're five against one. Not to mention, I'm a Grade 3 Advanced, and the others are Intermediate-ranked."

Azriel met his gaze, showing no sign of concern.

Instead, he responded with his own question.

"Instructor, answer me this. What you're doing here—it's treason. Not just against the academy, but against all four great clans, and the entirety of Asia... why?"

Benson looked at him as the other four men tightened their grips on their weapons, ready to strike.

"...Prince Azriel Crimson, please accept your death gracefully. For the future of humanity."

'Of course...'

A crooked smile spread across Azriel's face as he gripped Void Eater with both hands, holding it in front of him.

"I should warn you—I'm really terrible at dying."

Tension thickened in the air as they faced off, hostility brewing in their eyes.

Benson remained the only one standing straight, hands calmly behind his back.

Just as they were all about to move...

Everyone froze.

"...!"

"What the fuck!?"

"...How is this possible?"

"Shit."

The men's voices trembled, disbelief etched into their faces—even Benson and Azriel stared, stunned.

Leo burst into laughter, clutching his belly as he wiped tears from his eyes.

"Hahaha! Now this is what you call a plot twist!"

The body on the floor...

The Cradler.

It rose.

Slowly, it stood, headless, as thick, black blood oozed from its neck.

Everyone stood paralyzed, eyes wide with shock.

The creature towered over them, its body moving with an eerie grace as it bent down, picking up its decapitated head—still wearing that grotesque smile.

And then...

it placed the head back onto its neck, where it reattached itself, as if nothing had ever happened.

"Ah... fuck."

Chapter 93: Unbalanced [3]

Celestina dragged her feet through the black sand, her breath ragged as sweat caused her silver hair to stick to her face.

She still wore her soul armor, which offered some resistance to the heat, but not enough for the relentless black desert.

At first, she had followed Instructor Benson in secret.

Too many things didn't add up.

When she reached the bottom of the tunnel, she was shocked to see Instructor Benson meeting with four men she didn't recognize.

They wore standard black military uniforms.

But... why?

Why would soldiers be here, in the void dungeon?

It was a strict rule that only academy students were allowed entry for the next few weeks.

Driven by curiosity, she continued following them.

Or at least, she tried her best.

They moved fast.

Too fast.

Like they knew exactly where they were going.

And she was certain they did, especially with the strange device Instructor Benson held.

It was difficult to keep pace without being noticed, and she lost them more than once.

Only the faint footprints in the sand allowed her to track them.

Even then, she had to hurry, as the occasional gust of wind would blow, threatening to erase the trail.

Eventually, she arrived at a strange, circular platform that was wide open, with stairs leading down into something unknown.

The sight filled Celestina with a sense of unease.

What is this place?

Why did they come here?

Instructor Benson was supposed to find Azriel and Instructor Kevin.

Did that mean they were here too?

Her mind raced with questions, but she didn't let them stop her.

Taking a deep breath, she summoned her silver sword, gripping its hilt tightly.

She descended the stairs.

With every step, the air grew heavier, the darkness thickening around her.

Finally, she reached the bottom.

What she saw stunned her.

It was an abandoned tunnel, dimly lit by flickering torches along the walls.

But that wasn't what made her freeze.

Blood.

And mana cores.

Everywhere.

It seemed like Instructor Benson and the soldiers had slaughtered the residents of this strange tunnel.

And yet...

She felt a strange sense of delight.

Why?

Because all the mana cores were untouched.

They hadn't been consumed.

That meant they were all hers.

Surely, they wouldn't mind?

She was so close to breaking through, to becoming a Grade 1 Awakened after defeating the Dark King and absorbing its core.

With these mana cores, she'd not only achieve that but surpass it.

It would be foolish not to take advantage.

It was their own fault for leaving them behind.

Celestina approached one of the cores, picking it up with a smile.

The entire void dungeon had been strange, slow-paced.

In truth...

She wanted to kill more void creatures. She wanted to grow stronger.

But the chance had rarely presented itself.

Just as she was about to consume the mana core, though...

She felt it.

A gaze.

Her brows furrowed, and she looked up.

And froze.

Above her, hidden in the thick darkness of the ceiling, were dozens of vermilion eyes, staring back at her.

Her face darkened.

'I should have known... life can never be easy.'

*****

Azriel and the others froze, their expressions grim as they faced the Cradler.

The creature stood before them, smiling twistedly, its hollow eye sockets locked on them like black pits of endless terror. The swaddled bundle it had been cradling earlier was now gone.

Azriel's eyes met the sunken void where the Cradler's eyes should have been, and a deep, primal fear washed over him.

His entire body shuddered involuntarily.

The sheer horror of seeing a creature survive decapitation was unsettling enough, but the way it stood there—whole again, unfazed—was something beyond terrifying.

For a brief moment, the Cradler looked away from Azriel, its gaze shifting towards one of the soldiers holding a spear.

Azriel's heart pounded in his chest, and without thinking, his body tensed, sensing the imminent danger.

Benson's face had paled, his normally composed demeanor cracking as he shouted desperately,

"Get away from there, now!"

But it was too late.

The soldier didn't even have time to register the warning.

One second the Cradler stood far away; the next, it had closed the distance in a blink, appearing directly in front of the man with the spear.

A high-pitched whistle cut through the air as an arrow shot toward the creature.

But before it could make contact, the Cradler lazily raised one of its long, unnervingly thin hands, gripping the arrow mid-air.

The archer's face twisted in shock, his eyes widening in disbelief as the Cradler's fingers tightened, reducing the arrow to dust.

And then, with a sickeningly fluid motion, the Cradler raised its grotesque hand and slashed the spearman across the neck.

The blow was so swift that for a moment, it seemed as though nothing had happened.

But then the soldier's head detached from his body, rolling across the bridge before tumbling into the void below.

Azriel's mind blanked.

His stomach churned, and his breath caught in his throat as he watched the life drain from the man in front of him.

The sight of blood splattering the ground only added to the mounting horror that consumed him.

"…Shit!" Instructor Benson's voice broke the silence, laced with urgency.

"Back off! All of you, don't engage! I'll handle this!"

But Azriel barely heard him.

Before Benson could finish his command, the Cradler vanished again.

It was so fast—inhumanly fast—that Azriel had trouble tracking its movement.

One blink, and it was gone.

Another blink, and it was already in front of the archer.

"No… please…" the archer's lips trembled, his voice barely audible.

The Cradler's grotesque fingers moved with the same precision and cruelty, slicing through the archer's neck like it was cutting through paper.

His head fell, rolling across the cold stone bridge before disappearing over the edge, just like the spearman's.

Azriel released a shaky breath.

His heart raced as the weight of the situation bore down on him.

This wasn't just any ordinary void creature.

How was he supposed to defeat something like this?

His hands trembled slightly as he instinctively peered into the Cradler's mana core.

'A Grade 3 demon...'

Azriel's face went pale.

This realization hit him like a brick.

Though Instructor Benson was also a Grade 3 advanced , it was common knowledge that a void creature of the same rank as a human was still far more formidable in one-on-one combat.

It wasn't just a difference in strength, but in nature—a demon like this had abilities that humans couldn't begin to match.

The two remaining soldiers stood frozen in fear, their eyes wide as they clutched their weapons tightly.

Despite their terror, they gritted their teeth, trying to maintain composure.

It was a futile effort, given the carnage they had just witnessed.

Without warning, a sword appeared in Instructor Benson's hand.

He lunged forward, aiming to strike the Cradler down.

But the creature was fast—its unnaturally long nails intercepted the blow with ease, and a shockwave rippled through the air, causing the ground beneath them to crack and crumble.

Azriel's mind clicked into place, a sudden realization dawning on him.

'Wait… this could work.'

So what if the guardian was missing?

While it might have been stronger than the Cradler, this fight still presented an opportunity.

With Instructor Benson here, he could enact the same plan.

Let them clash. Let them fight it out.

But then his gaze shifted to the two remaining soldiers—the ones from Neo Genesis.

They had to go.

Azriel gripped Void Eater tightly in his hand, his knuckles white as he watched Instructor Benson.

Surprisingly, Benson seemed to be holding his own against the Cradler, at least for now.

Neither had used their full abilities yet, but Azriel knew it was only a matter of time.

Fighting on this narrow bridge was far from ideal, but none of them had a choice.

Spotting an opening, Azriel dashed forward, running past both the Cradler and Benson.

For a brief, heart-stopping second, the Cradler's hollow gaze met Azriel's.

Its unnaturally wide smile stretched even further, sending a chill down his spine, before it turned its attention back to Benson.

'Dammit..!'

Azriel pressed on, closing the distance between him and the two trembling soldiers.

They were distracted, their fear palpable.

Reaching them before they could react, Azriel thrust Void Eater at the swordsman's throat.

The man noticed just in time, jerking his head to the side.

But not fast enough.

"Gah! Damn it…!"

The swordsman fell to the ground, clutching his ear, blood seeping through his fingers.

Both soldiers scrambled back, distancing themselves from Azriel, eyes wide with panic.

Azriel narrowed his gaze.

'[Death's Blossom].'

In an instant, black smoke poured from Azriel's mouth and nose, coiling around his body like serpents, red lightning crackling around him as well.

The tips of his hair turned white, and the ground beneath his feet followed suit, frosting over with an unnatural chill.

And then, Azriel vanished from their sight.

Chapter 94: Unbalanced [4]

The two soldiers' eyes widened in surprise as Azriel's attack came at them.

The man with the axe gritted his teeth, suddenly spinning and bringing his weapon down with a deafening crash.

The sound of steel echoed through the cave, reverberating ominously.

Azriel blinked, taken aback—he had been parried.

This was the first time since arriving in this world that someone had managed to block his first move.

He didn't have a chance to catch his breath as the axe-wielding soldier pressed the attack, his movements fluid, each swing revealing his mastery of the weapon.

Azriel gritted his teeth, barely managing to block each strike, but it was clear—he was on the defensive, each blow pushing him closer to the edge of the bridge.

His arms began to go numb under the weight of the man's relentless onslaught.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the swordsman, his ear still bleeding, charging toward him with fury painted across his face.

'Curse it all…!'

Just as his foot hovered dangerously over the edge of the edge, Azriel parried the axe with Void Eater and launched a brutal kick into the man's abdomen.

The impact sent spit flying from his mouth as he stumbled backward.

Azriel wasn't finished.

Grabbing the man's hair, he yanked him toward the swordsman, forcing the latter to falter and cancel his attack.

But Azriel didn't stop there.

In an instant, he activated [Death's Blossom], disappearing from their sight.

He reappeared in front of them, Void Eater swinging through the air, but the swordsman managed to block with his blade.

Azriel pushed forward, sending the man staggering back, only for the axe-wielder to swing horizontally at his side.

Azriel twisted awkwardly, blocking the strike in time, sparks flying from the collision. The swordsman lunged, thrusting his sword at Azriel's eyes.

He ducked, narrowly avoiding the blade, and struck the man in the solar plexus with his left palm.

Before he could follow through, the axe-wielder kicked his legs out from under him, sending Azriel crashing to one knee.

Both soldiers brought their weapons down at him in unison.

Azriel raised Void Eater above his head, the katana straining under the force of their combined assault.

His bones felt as if they were about to snap from the pressure.

But he didn't give in.

He couldn't.

This was only the beginning.

Suddenly, red lightning crackled around his body—different this time.

It felt… charged, building in intensity.

The soldiers' eyes widened, and they instantly backed away from him.

A second later, red lightning discharged from his body in a small radius, forcing them further back.

Taking advantage of the moment, Azriel leaped to his feet, catching his ragged breath.

He glanced toward the gate where the Cradler and Instructor Benson were still locked in combat.

It was strange—they were clashing, but nothing more.

He could easily follow their movements now.

Neither was fighting seriously.

Azriel's face grew grim.

He had to deal with these two soldiers before the real fight began.

'[Death's Blossom] isn't fast enough for both of them...'

He could unleash a maximum of three strikes with the first move of [Dance of Death], but these Neo Genesis soldiers had already seen through it.

Just as he was formulating his next move, a gust of wind hit his face.

The swordsman was smirking.

Azriel's instincts flared as the hairs on the back of his neck stood up.

'Shit!'

He spun around just in time to block the axe aimed at his head.

The soldier had somehow appeared behind him, despite being next to the swordsman moments ago.

'What the hell?! How did he move so fast?!'

Azriel's mind raced.

But before he could process it, another gust of wind blew past him.

He kicked the axe-wielder back and spun again, narrowly intercepting the swordsman's strike.

But…

His luck was running out.

The axe-wielder swung again from behind. Azriel tried to dodge, but the swordsman held him in place.

The blade grazed his back, cutting through his ice shield just in time to prevent a deeper wound.

"Argh!" Azriel grunted in pain, his body shuddering.

His left fist was now encased in a gauntlet of ice, and before the swordsman could react, Azriel drove it into his face, sending him flying.

The ice shattered on impact, and Azriel quickly turned his attention back to the axe-wielder, who was struggling to free his weapon from the ground.

'Idiot...'

Azriel kicked him square in the face, sending him reeling.

His body crackled with lightning again, and he lunged forward, closing in on the dazed man.

But just as he raised Void Eater to finish him off, another gust of wind swept in from behind.

Azriel clicked his tongue in frustration as the swordsman appeared again, faster than before.

He narrowed his eyes.

'...Wind.'

The swordsman had to have some sort of wind affinity.

That much was clear.

Azriel's eyes darted around, but the axe-wielder had vanished again.

He was fast—too fast.

Then, in a blink, the axe-wielder reappeared at Azriel's side, swinging his weapon at his neck.

Azriel barely ducked in time, leaping back to safety.

'Wind affinity for the swordsman, but the axe-wielder… invisibility? I can't tell if it's an affinity, skill or a unique skill.'

Azriel gritted his teeth.

Fortunately, there seemed to be a limitation—otherwise, the axe-wielder wouldn't need to reveal himself while attacking.

If he could move freely, Azriel would've been dead by now.

But he wasn't out of the fight yet.

In the blink of an eye, the axe-wielder vanished again, and the swordsman, carried by a gust of wind, charged at Azriel.

"Annoying..."

They were relentless.

Azriel didn't hesitate.

Red lightning crackled around him, but he stood rooted in place, unmoving.

When he blinked, both of them flanked him, weapons raised to strike from either side.

And then...

Azriel parried both attacks at monstrous speed, leaving only red lightning trailing in the air.

The two soldiers stared wide-eyed, but they didn't retreat.

Instead, they pressed forward, attacking faster, stronger, and more relentlessly.

Azriel matched them, standing firm, parrying each blow with precision.

To an outsider—someone even of Awakened rank—it would have been impossible to track their movements.

From a distance, all that could be seen were three figures standing still, their arms moving like a blur, with red lightning illuminating the chaos.

Azriel gritted his teeth.

'Faster...!'

They pushed themselves too.

Azriel's muscles strained under the pressure, his body protesting with each movement.

Cuts began to appear on his face and body.

He tried to shield himself with ice before each strike could land, but he lacked the mana to reinforce it properly.

The ice shattered upon impact, unable to fully block their relentless blows.

The three fighters were relentless, blood splattering across the ground, painting a gruesome scene.

And then...

Azriel's lips twisted into a crooked smile, his bloodied face unnerving the two soldiers, who narrowed their eyes in apprehension.

'Finally...'

But by then, it was too late.

The outcome of this exchange had already been decided the moment they tried to match Azriel's speed.

Their mistake wasn't trying to be faster than him—after all, speed wasn't the deciding factor.

It was endurance.

And...

Which weapon would break first.

On one side was Void Eater, the soul weapon once wielded by the great king Joaquin Crimson. On the other side, a simple sword and axe forged by unknown hands, wielded by men of no renown.

The answer was obvious.

In a split second, Azriel's smile widened.

His lightning shifted from red to white, catching them both off guard.

Void Eater, now enveloped in crackling white lightning, clashed with their weapons.

In an instant, the sword and axe froze over, and then...

They shattered.

"...!"

Without hesitation, Azriel kicked the former axe-wielder aside and drove Void Eater into the swordsman's throat.

A sickening sound filled the air as the katana pierced flesh and windpipe.

Azriel could feel the resistance, the slickness of it.

It disgusted him.

The swordsman's eyes widened in shock as blood gurgled in his throat, his life quickly fading.

Azriel pulled Void Eater free, and with a dull thud, the swordsman collapsed to the ground.

"No! Vaan!"

The former axe-wielder's voice echoed through the cave, thick with anguish.

Vaan.

'So that was the swordsman's name.'

But Azriel couldn't dwell on it.

He approached the axe-wielder, who had fallen to his knees, despair etched across his bloodied face.

Gritting his teeth, the man glared at Azriel, his eyes full of hate.

"You... you demon! Killing without remorse!"

Azriel looked down at him, blood dripping from his body onto the cold stone floor.

"...The real demons are the ones fighting on the other side of this bridge—your boss and my instructor. He was going to kill me... and the other cadets."

"No!" The axe-wielder shook his head desperately, tears mixing with the blood on his face.

"It was only going to be you! He wasn't going to kill anyone else! But now... ah, shit!"

Azriel sighed as the man's gaze fell to the floor, tears streaming freely.

"What is your name?" Azriel asked.

The man lifted his head, glaring at him, voice hoarse and trembling.

"Go to hell..."

Azriel looked solemnly before plunging Void Eater into his throat as well.

Blood seeped from the man's lips, his eyes dulling as life drained from them. Moments later, he collapsed onto the cold floor, joining Vaan in death.

The fight was over.

Azriel stood victorious.

And in the end...

All Azriel felt was the euphoric rush from [Core Reaper].

Then it hit him.

"Oh..."

He had advanced a grade.

Chapter 95: Birth of Genesis [1]

Azriel looked solemnly before plunging Void Eater into his throat.

Blood seeped from the man's lips as the light in his eyes faded.

He collapsed onto the cold, hard ground.

And in the end…

All Azriel felt was the euphoric rush from [Core Reaper].

But then, he felt it.

He had advanced a grade.

Yet, even as he sensed the shift in power, there was no joy.

How could there be?

The weight of killing two humans gnawed at him.

And worse, [Core Reaper] had made it feel... good.

Which only made it a thousand times worse.

"You're getting used to it. No vomiting this time like with your first kill. You adapt quickly," Leo said, his voice casual as he stood beside Azriel, a satisfied smile curling on his lips.

He glanced at the bodies.

"Piercing their throats... how gruesome."

Azriel sighed, lowering himself to the cold floor. He needed to recover.

This was only the beginning.

The two men he had killed were insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

Mere specks of dust.

Suddenly, a deafening crash reverberated through the cave, shaking the bridge.

Azriel's eyes widened as he squinted through the dust.

What he saw made him question reality.

There, in the center of the bridge, stood Instructor Benson.

He towered over the Cradler, who now knelt, both arms severed, black blood pouring from its wounds.

A lance—obsidian, its surface matte and sharp—pierced the Cradler's chest, its vicious point protruding from its back.

Azriel's breath hitched.

But that wasn't the most shocking part.

Benson was clad in armor.

Soul armor.

The blackened metal clung to him, sleek and without unnecessary embellishments.

Its edges looked as though they could cut as easily as they protected.

Every movement in the armor was fluid, Benson wearing it as though it was part of him—an embodiment of menace.

Not a single scratch marked its surface.

"You really miscalculated this one..."

Azriel couldn't disagree.

Benson had never fought in the book.

He didn't know his real power.

He was just a Grade 3 Advanced, or so Azriel had thought.

Everything about Benson—his black hair, his black eyes, his cold demeanor—was unsettling.

And as Benson stared down at the Cradler, who smiled even in defeat, Azriel felt his skin crawl.

The Cradler's empty eyes locked onto him.

Even on death's doorstep, the creature only had eyes for him.

Why?

Benson ripped the lance from its chest and, without hesitation, tore the mana core from its body.

The Cradler slumped forward.

Dead.

This time, there was no coming back.

Even for something like the Cradler, without a heart and a core, death was final.

Azriel hoped.

Benson sighed, then turned his gaze to Azriel.

His eyes briefly flickered to the two corpses at his feet before settling back on him.

"As expected, those two weren't enough to get rid of you... my prince."

Azriel's eyes narrowed as he forced himself to stand.

His body ached, but not enough to waste a health potion.

"Nice armor."

Benson hummed, taking slow, deliberate steps forward. His footsteps echoed ominously.

"I find it strange that you don't have one yourself. After all, you spent two years in the Void Realm, and you're a prince."

"I didn't think armor suited me, but... I might need to rethink that."

Benson continued his slow advance.

"Let's not waste any more time. Only one of us leaves here today, my prince."

Azriel gripped Void Eater tighter, his mind racing.

'How much longer…?'

Fighting Benson seemed inevitable now. It wasn't a surprise. Too many things had gone wrong.

But killing someone who just took down a Grade 3 demon single-handedly?

That was going to be a challenge.

'I can't hold back this time.'

If he did, it would be his end.

A crooked smile spread across Azriel's face as he began walking toward Benson.

"I'll gladly be your executioner today, Instructor."

Then…

His face turned blank.

*****

Instructor Ranni narrowed her eyes as she saw a figure dressed in full black approach her.

His skin was pale white, but she could not discern anything else.

The presence of the man made her skin crawl.

'So it's finally time, huh...?'

As the man approached and got closer, Instructor Ranni saw something that left her stunned.

The man in black... his eyes were covered with a black cloth.

'He is blind...?'

Once he got close enough, he stopped in front of her.

Instructor Ranni unconsciously tensed up.

"Sir, you cannot enter the void dungeon for the next few weeks; the Hero Academy has it booked for that time."

The man in black smiled—a kind smile.

"...."

"You certainly are diligent, not taking any breaks even after days have passed. Not even when the second group entered the void dungeon. You are admirable, to say the least, Instructor Ranni."

Ranni furrowed her brows slightly.

'He knows who I am... Is he really blind?'

The man in black shook his head.

"Well, no matter. It's not like I'm entering the void dungeon; those who wanted to have already..."

"...what?"

Instructor Ranni felt the hairs on her nape stand on end.

There was something fundamentally wrong with this man, but she couldn't place what it was.

Suddenly, her eyes widened as the ground shook violently, and the sound of explosions resounded through the sacred capital.

People screamed and began running in every direction—some tripping over one another, others crying, not knowing where to go.

It all happened so suddenly.

'Bombs...?'

"... Are you sure you want to chit-chat with me, or would you rather go save the pitiful children who are going to be buried under rubble?"

Instructor Ranni glared at the man in black.

She was about to attack him but held back. It wouldn't help her now.

She calmed as a thought passed through her mind.

'Right, Solomon is here. He must have already prevented anyone from dying...'

A sigh escaped her lips as she gazed at the man in black more calmly. Though he wore a cloth covering his eyes, she felt them piercing her.

"Oh? So the students are more precious? Well, it's an obvious choice. I'm glad you aren't stupid."

"You Neo Genesis really know how to put on a show. I'll give you that. But... you've already lost. I'm giving you a choice."

She took a step forward.

"Let me take you in quietly, or I will kill you here on the spot for treason."

A curious smile appeared on his face.

"I've already lost? Now I'm certainly curious what made you think that. Perhaps I should go see what's happening down there after all..."

"As if I would—!"

She cut her words short as she heard another explosion and more people screaming.

Her face darkened.

'What is that clown doing...?'

Was he fighting someone who wouldn't let him end this quickly?

She shook her head inwardly as the man in black took a step forward.

"I've changed my mind. Please step aside, Miss Ranni. You don't have to worry, though, as I will only be observing."

"The only place you'll be observing is the dirt seeping through your coffin."

"!?"

A sudden voice came from behind the man in black as both Instructor Ranni and he turned toward the source.

'What is he doing here...?'

She was stunned.

"Things are certainly getting more interesting by the second... So this is where you got your confidence from. The plans have been leaked."

Both looked at the new individual, and Ranni widened her eyes.

A man stood there, his blond hair catching the light, and his green eyes pierced back at the man in black.

"Grandmaster Thomas, what are you doing here!?"

Thomas's eyes traveled to Instructor Ranni.

"Instructor Ranni, it's good to see you again. Alas, I wish our reunion could have been under more fortunate circumstances. As for your question... you can blame the prince."

'Prince? Does he mean prince Azriel? ...Why?'

She was confused. There was no reason for Thomas to be here. The right-hand man of Ragnar should always stay by the Frost King's side.

Yet here he was, moving without his king, only acting on Azriel's words.

Why?

"Hm? It looks like your presence was for nothing after all, Grandmaster Thomas."

"...?"

Thomas looked at him, confused, his eyebrows furrowed in puzzlement.

The screams of the people grew more frantic, and the sounds of explosions and battles erupted against Neo Genesis and the heroes arriving at the scene.

It wasn't looking good.

But at least they could apprehend the man in front of them with Thomas here.

She wasn't sure how strong the man in black was; perhaps he was weak enough for Instructor Ranni to take him down without Thomas's help.

But she had an unsettling feeling about the man in black.

As Ranni met Thomas's gaze, they both stepped toward the man in black.

But not even a second later, a crushing gravity pressed down on them.

Neither were spared.

Both were brought to their knees.

'Ugh...!'

It was horrifying. Suffocating. Painful.

Barely, she managed to look up, and to her surprise, the man in black was kneeling.

Alarm bells rang in her head.

'Run!'

She had to run.

But she couldn't.

Something terrible was happening. The sound of people screaming and distant battles faded as the pressure locked both Thomas and Ranni in place.

Then, she felt someone approach.

"I greet the great Heptarch Zoran, Apostle of Ruin."

Her mind blanked.

Thomas's mind blanked.

Words escaped that they barely understood.

Both their faces were covered with sweat as it dripped onto the floor.

"Ah..."

A barely audible sound escaped her lips.

'Heptarch... one of the seven rumored kings of Neo Genesis...?'

She didn't want to believe it.

Why was someone like that here?

Her eyes traveled toward the figure—or whatever that thing was.

Her body shuddered and froze.

It didn't seem like a person.

It was like a humanoid living darkness stood in front of her, its wide white eyes gazing at her. There was no mouth visible, yet its voice made her blood run cold.

"Order everyone to retreat immediately. The plan has failed."

"What about the ones inside?"

"They are all dead by now."

The man in black didn't speak for a few seconds.
