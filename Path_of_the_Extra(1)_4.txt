"Oh, by the way, Azriel, this is Yelena, my childhood friend."

The girl, Yelena, flinched slightly at being mentioned suddenly but gave a polite nod toward Azriel.

"My name is Yelena, ranked sixth. I hope we can help and take care of each other during our time here!"

Azriel chuckled, while Celestina smiled, amused by Yelena's nervousness.

"As Lumine said, my name is Azriel. It's nice to meet you, Yelena. And there's no need to be overly formal with me. I hope we can be friends, just like I am with Lumine."

'And here I thought he didn't care about connecting with more people.'

At least that was her impression, but it seemed she was wrong.

Not that she blamed Azriel, considering both of them were among the top students in the academy.

Not wanting to be left out, Celestina gave a polite smile to the two of them.

"My name is Celestina Frost, a friend of Azriel. I hope I can be friends with both of you as well."

"...!"

After introducing themselves, some more students entered the classroom.

The four of them continued chatting about trivial things until, suddenly, they all fell silent, leaving the rest of the students in the room who had been listening intently confused.

Their heads turned toward the door where a pale woman with striking blue hair and eyes that shimmered like the ocean stood, looking as if she were about to fall over any moment.

Instructor Ranni had arrived.

Chapter 53: HCS-1
The moment Instructor Ranni entered the classroom, instead of falling silent, the students grew louder.

After all, Instructor Ranni was an extremely famous hero, known not only for her beauty but also for her prowess.

Having someone of her caliber as their teacher was enough to get anyone excited.

Dragging her feet towards the front of the room, she looked like she was about to fall asleep at any moment.

'With her... I can definitely relate.'

Azriel thought, nodding to himself.

Unlike the other students, he watched quietly, not sharing in their excitement.

Azriel felt a twinge of sadness knowing that Nol wasn't in the same class as him, but perhaps it was better that way.

When Instructor Ranni finally reached the front of the classroom, her eyes swept over the students.

Her mere gaze was enough to silence the entire room.

'She's dangerous.'

Azriel noted, though he knew she wasn't as strong as Solomon.

Still, she was formidable.

Not that he needed any reminders—every single instructor at the entrance exam had been dangerous, from Salvator to Juliet.

Ranni's lazy demeanor wouldn't fool Azriel.

'Why does everyone in this world have to be so... special?'

He mused.

'The author really must have had some screws loose.'

Suddenly, Ranni's eyes locked onto Azriel's.

Both of them held each other's gaze, neither willing to look away.

The atmosphere grew tense, and the other students began to notice.

"...Cadet Azriel Crimson."

Ranni said, breaking into a smile.

"Congratulations on becoming the apex. I expect great things from you."

Azriel nodded.

"I will do my best to meet your expectations."

Instructor Ranni seemed pleased as she then turned her attention to the rest of the students.

"For those students who are late, you'll get detention for a week. If I have to drag my feet here so early in the morning to see your faces, then you should be doing the same."

Instructor Ranni announced, her words sharply contrasting with the smile on her face.

Azriel sighed inwardly, relieved.

'I'm really glad I didn't decide to skip class today.'

It didn't seem like he could get away with it as easily as he used to back when he was Leo.

"As for today, I'm not going to waste time with boring academy rules and such. It's not like any of you are going to remember them anyway. Instead, I'll be giving you a brief overview of the trip you all know is coming up next week—to the Void Dungeon."

Instructor Ranni continued, noticing that everyone was listening attentively at the mention of the Void Dungeon.

"Some of you deserve to be at this academy, while others do not. The Void Dungeon will test whether you can become a hero or not. If you can't handle it, I suggest you drop out now or after, because trust me when I say this: there's a very real chance you could lose your life."

Some students paled at her words, while others treated it as a joke.

'Idiots...'

Azriel thought, shaking his head.

Those who didn't take her words seriously were truly foolish.

They were going to die, without a doubt.

The Void Dungeon was not merciful in the slightest, but that's also why it was the best place to grow stronger.

However, if the students didn't take it seriously, they'd simply become food for the nightmares that lurked inside.

Instructor Ranni narrowed her eyes, sensing the dismissive attitudes of some of the students.

"Looks like I'll need to prove it, huh?"

With that, a glass tube suddenly appeared in her hand.

The tube wasn't empty.

"...!"

Azriel and Celestina's eyes went wide at what they saw inside.

Screeech-!

The sound of a chair being pushed back drew everyone's attention to Lumine, who had abruptly stood up, a long silver sword in his hand.

His face was pale as he stared at the tube, clearly frightened.

Instructor Ranni smirked at his reaction.

"Calm down, Cadet Lumine. This little boy won't do anything as long as it stays inside this special tube, which is designed to keep it secure."

"Lumine..."

Yelena murmured, worried by his behavior, while others stifled laughter.

Instructor Ranni's gaze turned icy.

"Why are you fools laughing? In fact, if it weren't for me and this tube, you should be reacting the same way Cadet Lumine did—ready to eliminate it as fast as possible. His reaction is exactly why he's ranked second, unlike the rest of you."

Her words cut through the students like a knife.

The "little boy" she referred to inside the tube was a worm—a Void Worm.

These small creatures were so weak that even a Grade 3 Dormant could kill them.

They didn't even have mana cores.

But despite their weakness, they were creatures that even a Saint would have to be cautious of.

The moment a Void Worm got the chance, it would try to enter a person's body, causing the host to lose control and become a puppet to the worm that had invaded their brain.

Why Void Worms didn't have mana cores was still unknown and remained a subject of ongoing research.

One of the most dangerous threats in the Void Realm or Void Dungeon was these Void Worms.

They were easy to miss, but if they got to you, it was over.

If one got into your arm, it was better to amputate it before it reached your brain and forced you to watch as it made you kill everyone you cared about without any control over your own body.

Even other Void creatures weren't safe from these worms.

There was even a case where a Grade 3 Saint lost their life to a Void Worm.

As Instructor Ranni explained these things, the students turned as pale as Lumine, their fear evident.

Some looked like they might vomit as she continued to go into detail, clearly enjoying their reactions.

After a while, she finally relented, allowing the class some relief.

Lumine sat down, looking a bit embarrassed.

"Oh, and by the way, Cadet Azriel..."

Suddenly, she locked eyes with Azriel.

"Just like Cadet Lumine, you don't need to be on guard... as your instructor, I won't let this thing do anything."

"...?"

Azriel looked confused until he noticed something.

"Oh..."

He was holding Void Eater in his right hand.

'How did I not notice...?'

Celestina and the rest of the students stared at him in shock.

Dismissing his katana, Azriel smiled wryly at Instructor Ranni.

"I apologize. It seems that, like Cadet Lumine, my body reacted on instinct to the presence of a Void Worm."

It wasn't something he was particularly embarrassed about.

Instructor Ranni shook her head.

"There's nothing to apologize for. The mere fact that both you and Cadet Lumine reacted like that to such a small creature proves why you're the top students among the first years. It also shows just how many times both of you must have fought against Void creatures or humans consumed by Void Worms."

Azriel and Lumine both nodded and thanked Instructor Ranni, while the others who had laughed earlier looked away in shame.

Instructor Ranni then continued to offer more advice about the Void Dungeon before finally dismissing the class.

Everyone was now free to do whatever they wanted for the day, as Instructor Ranni apparently planned to go back to sleep.

Of course, Azriel wouldn't be doing that.

He'd probably just wake up after a few hours anyway, so what was the best use of his time now?

Take this opportunity to explore the academy.

Chapter 54: Accusation
"So, how was your class?"

Azriel asked, watching Nol shovel food into his mouth.

Nol shrugged, still chewing.

"No idea. I fell asleep."

Azriel sighed.

The two of them were sitting opposite each other in the cafeteria.

After class had ended, Celestina had gone to chat with Lumine and Yelena, likely trying to form connections.

Seizing the opportunity, Azriel had fled to meet up with Nol in the cafeteria, where they were now enjoying a much-needed meal.

Neither of them held back with their food.

Nol had overslept and barely made it to class on time, while Azriel had skipped breakfast altogether.

There was also another reason Azriel had hurried over here.

He knew that most of the halls and classrooms would soon be flooded with second- and third-year students trying to recruit first-years into their factions.

There was a high chance that Celestina, Lumine, and Yelena were now trying to fend off such advances.

"Master, are you planning to join the Crimson Faction?"

Nol asked between bites.

Azriel shook his head.

"No, there's no reason for me to join my sister's faction, nor do I have any interest in it."

"Will she be okay with that?"

Nol asked, looking confused.

Azriel thought for a moment before replying.

"I'm sure my dear sister won't mind if I don't join the Crimson Faction, but she'll definitely ask me about it today... The real problem will be the other students."

Nol's confusion deepened as Azriel continued, taking a bite of fried chicken.

"The second- and third-year students are much bolder than you might think. Even my title as Prince won't deter them. In fact, being the Apex will only attract them more. These upperclassmen understand the true meaning of being a hero, and they definitely won't shy away from approaching me..."

'Though the real ones who will suffer are Yelena and Lumine...'

Both were unknown before entering the academy, and the upperclassmen are likely going to try and take advantage of that—especially Lumine, given that he's ranked second.

The moment they find out about his rank, things could get difficult.

'Still, I won't help them unless absolutely necessary... I'm not their babysitter.'

Azriel intended to befriend the main cast, sure, but that didn't mean he was going to hold their hands through everything.

He wanted them to become stronger than they were in the book, and if that required throwing them into the fire, he'd do it without hesitation.

'...If I recall correctly, a certain event is going to happen today.'

Specifically, something involving Lumine.

There were always people dissatisfied with the rankings, and in the book, Lumine had been the Apex and even got into a duel on the first day because of it.

But now that Lumine was ranked second, would the same thing happen?

'It's not like they can try the same thing with me...'

Azriel could feel the stares directed at him and Nol in the cafeteria.

By now, they must have realized who he was—Azriel Crimson.

Most of them were probably still confused by the negative rumors surrounding him and his trip to the Void Realm.

Add to that the fact that he's a prince and the Apex, and they couldn't just recklessly challenge him without proper backing.

'...Unless it's that person, but he probably didn't attend class today.'

Azriel smiled slightly as he stood up.

"Master?"

Nol looked at him, puzzled.

"Let's pack this food and go... If I'm right, we'll be able to enjoy a good show while eating."

If his hunch was correct, something entertaining was about to happen.

*****

"How did you become friends with Azriel Crimson...?"

Lumine and Yelena walked through the corridors of the academy, surrounded by other students, when Yelena asked the question.

Lumine had to stop himself from twitching his lips in discomfort.

If he had to tell her the full story, she might look at him like he was some kind of idiot.

And who could blame her?

Anyone would think that if he admitted it all started with him chasing some weird butterfly.

"...I met him at the academy cemetery."

Yelena looked at him, wide-eyed, as they continued walking.

They were heading to one of the gym rooms in the academy to train.

"There's a cemetery in the academy?"

she asked, furrowing her brows.

Lumine nodded.

If he was right, it was probably filled with the graves of deceased students and instructors.

"Wait..."

Yelena's brows furrowed further.

"Why were both of you even there?"

Not daring to meet her gaze, Lumine kept his eyes forward.

"I... I was just, you know, exploring the academy at the time when I suddenly found myself there. The same was probably true for Azriel, I presume."

He could feel her skeptical stare but chose to ignore it.

"Is that so? But still..."

Yelena hesitated, clearly holding back her words.

Lumine glanced at her, curious.

"What is it?"

"You know... can we trust him?"

Lumine sighed.

He couldn't blame her for being cautious, especially given her past.

"Why would you think otherwise?"

"You know what they say about him, right? That he was basically a delinquent before his disappearance."

Lumine stopped in his tracks as they reached the stairs.

"You shouldn't judge a person based on some rumors, Yelena. Besides..."

He recalled the time he spent with Azriel in the cafeteria.

"He's a kind person. Trust me."

Yelena still looked a little doubtful but eventually sighed.

"If you say so, I'll trust you..."

Suddenly, she narrowed her eyes at Lumine.

"What about Celestina?"

Lumine blinked.

"What about her?"

"Do you trust her?"

It was the same question she had asked about Azriel, but Lumine felt the meaning was entirely different this time.

A chill ran down his spine, as if answering wrong would bring some sort of calamity.

Celestina had spoken to both of them after class when Azriel suddenly disappeared as well.

He could tell she wanted to be friends with them too.

"Well... she s-seems to be close with Azriel, so I guess she can be trusted... a little."

Her emerald eyes seemed to be judging him, as if he were on trial, but then they suddenly softened as she smiled.

"If that's all, then it's fine, I suppose..."

Lumine sighed in relief, even though he didn't fully understand why.

It felt like he had just dodged a bullet.

"I take it you are Lumine Versille, ranked second?"

A loud voice boomed through the hallway, drawing the attention of Lumine and Yelena.

They looked up the stairs to see a group of students standing at the top, among them a tall figure with long red hair.

"My name is Kai, ranked ninth."

The other students also turned their attention toward the commotion, their curiosity piqued.

"What's happening?"

"I don't know. Are they going to fight?"

"Woah! already on the first day?"

Kai, towering over both Lumine and Yelena, stepped down the stairs until he was face-to-face with Lumine.

The grinning Kai looked down at him, his smile widening.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged puzzled glances.

"Is something wrong?"

Lumine asked.

Kai's grin grew even wider.

"Yes, in fact, there is something wrong."

Yelena's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"And what would that be?"

"That your ranking, Lumine Versille, is bullshit."

Lumine's eyes widened in surprise, as did those of the students watching the confrontation.

"Bullshit? How can that be?"

"Maybe he cheated?"

"That's impossible."

"The exams were overseen by the best instructors and the headmistress herself."

"Exactly."

Yelena's face darkened with anger.

"No one can cheat in the exams. All rankings are legitimate."

Kai shook his head.

"You're telling me that this no-name outperformed Princess Celestina and everyone else who has made a name for themselves before coming to the academy?"

Lumine met Kai's gaze calmly.

"And what if I did?"

Kai's expression hardened.

"Then I say that's bullshit. You must have used some kind of drug to enhance your powers temporarily. That would also explain why you sent that poor cadet to the infirmary—because you couldn't control your powers properly"

Yelena scoffed at his words.

"That's a baseless accusation. What proof do you have?"

Kai leaned forward, lowering his voice so only Lumine and Yelena could hear.

"Prince Azriel told me himself."

""!!""

Chapter 55: Celestial Arena
The Celestial Arena was a famous spot within the academy, a place where students were allowed to duel freely.

It was the perfect training ground, a place where skills were honed, and strength was tested.

And now, on the very first day of the academy, a duel was about to take place.

Students filled the stands surrounding the arena, eager to witness the duel.

Among those heading toward the Celestial Arena was...

"Celestina..."

Yelena hurried over, her expression panicked as she approached Celestina, who was already at the highest stand, overlooking the arena.

Down below, Lumine stood at one end, with Kai facing him on the opposite side.

"Why are Lumine and Cadet Kai about to duel?"

Of course, Celestina knew who Kai was, but she didn't understand how this situation had escalated so quickly.

Word of a duel on the first day had spread like wildfire through the academy, and now she was here, seeing with her own eyes that Lumine was one of the participants.

Yelena hesitated before explaining.

"Cadet Kai approached us when we were on our way to train. He accused Lumine of cheating to gain his rank, claiming he used some sort of enhancement drug. And he said that Azriel was the one who told him."

Celestina looked at Yelena, a puzzled expression crossing her face.

"He specifically said Azriel told him that?"

Yelena nodded.

"Yes, but Lumine didn't believe him. They argued, and it led to this duel."

Both girls turned their attention back to the arena, where Lumine was glaring coldly at Kai, who responded with a mocking grin.

"Do you think it could have really been Azri—"

"It wasn't."

Celestina interrupted, her voice firm.

Even she was surprised by her own certainty, and Yelena's wide eyes mirrored her shock.

But then Celestina recalled everything Azriel had shown her, from the banquet to now.

'I think I'm starting to understand you more.'

"But..."

Yelena began, still unsure.

"Cadet Kai is lying about Azriel."

Celestina continued.

"If Azriel had an issue with Lumine and wanted to send a message, he would've done it himself. He wouldn't send someone else in his place."

Yelena looked doubtful for a moment, then sighed.

"Lumine asked me to trust him, and he trusts you. Even if he can be naive about some things, as his childhood friend, I know he has a good eye for people."

Celestina smiled at her words.

"...You know, saying things like that, with no intention of me hearing, is dangerous for my already fragile heart."

"...!"

Suddenly, both Celestina and Yelena turned as Azriel approached them, a slight smile on his face.

He wasn't alone—another student walked beside him.

'...He was with Azriel at the banquet.'

Her attention shifted back to Azriel as he stepped in front of her.

For a few seconds, he simply stared into her eyes, and she found herself unable to look away.

He was the first to break eye contact, glancing down at the arena where Lumine and Kai faced each other.

"...Thanks for trusting me."

Azriel said softly.

"Of course..."

Celestina replied, wondering what was going through his mind.

'Why does it feel like trusting him... meant a lot?'

Was she overthinking it?

She wasn't sure.

"Master... just say the word, and I'll turn that meathead into just meat."

The silver-haired boy said, glaring at Kai.

'Master?'

Celestina and Yelena exchanged surprised glances.

Neither had expected Azriel to be addressed like that, yet Azriel merely kept his gaze ahead.

"Calm down, Nol... taking his head won't change anything."

Nol continued to glare at Kai.

"It will for me. That disgraceful filth dares to utter your name with its tainted tongue—I should rip it off."

'...To be so angry on his behalf.'

Celestina was impressed by Nol's loyalty.

'But can he really do what he says?'

She didn't recall anyone named Nol being in the top 10, yet Azriel didn't seem to dismiss his words lightly either.

Azriel sighed.

"Even if you rip his head off, nothing will change... after all, he isn't the one with the brains."

Nol's glare shifted to confusion.

"What do you mean, Master?"

"He means that Cadet Kai is following someone else's orders."

Azriel nodded.

"Celestina's right. Someone told Kai to lie to Lumine using my name... Now, who could that person be?"

Using Azriel's name recklessly was dangerous, especially if discovered.

Outside the academy, such a slight could have serious consequences.

But within these walls, the instructors had to treat all students—regardless of their family backgrounds—equally, at least on the surface.

The instructors were likely watching this unfold from the shadows, prepared to intervene only if the duel became too dangerous.

"Whoever convinced Kai to use my name in the academy must be extremely bold."

Because once Kai stepped outside the academy grounds, no instructor would stop Azriel from exacting his revenge.

Someone had to be bold enough to reassure Kai that he could get away with it.

'The most likely candidates would be Jasmine or Caleus... but neither has a motive for this.'

Suddenly, Azriel began walking forward, drawing the attention of everyone around, including the students who had been watching Celestina and the others.

"Master?"

"Where are you going, Azriel?"

Azriel paused, but didn't turn around.

"Nothing much... just going to lure out whoever is responsible for this mess."

At first, he had come here for entertainment.

But after learning that someone had used his name to try and ruin the reputation he had been working to rebuild?

"This has become personal."

Azriel jumped down, landing in the center of the arena, right in front of everyone's eyes.

""!?""

*****

'To target me on the very first day with such tactics...'

Azriel couldn't help but feel a flicker of admiration.

Unperturbed by the gazes of the gathered students, he continued his approach toward Lumine.

"Who is that...?"

"That's Prince Azriel Crimson..."

"Seriously...? So he's the apex, huh?"

"But why is he entering the arena...?"

"Don't tell me the apex himself is going to fight?!"

"What a first day this is turning out to be..."

As Azriel arrived in front of the stunned Lumine, he offered a small, reassuring smile and placed a hand on his shoulder, giving it a friendly pat.

"Thank you for trying to protect my name, Lumine."

Despite his shock, Lumine managed a smile in return and shook his head.

"We're friends, right? Besides, it isn't just for your name. He was insulting Yelena and me."

Lumine's gaze hardened as he glared at Kai.

Undoubtedly, if the duel were to happen, Lumine would emerge victorious, easily humiliating Kai in the process.

Azriel nodded in agreement.

"I understand, but I must apologize. This person is merely a pawn being used by someone else who's trying to get to me through you."

Lumine furrowed his brows, processing the information.

"...So no matter what I do, it won't change anything?"

"Exactly."

Lumine seemed to think calmly as he looked toward Kai now with a disinterested gaze.

There would be no point in destroying a mere foot soldier.

Instead, the focus should be on the mastermind behind the manipulation.

As if sensing the change in attitude from Lumine, Kai, who had been grinning stiffly at Azriel's appearance, felt that grin vanish from his face.

"What do you want me to do?"

Azriel's smile widened in response.

"Just leave everything to me. Instead..."

He pointed toward the stands where Yelena was seated.

"Go and reassure your childhood friend."

'Soon to be girlfriend.'

Azriel kept that last part to himself as Lumine nodded and started to leave.

The crowd of students looked on, puzzled and disappointed.

"Are they still going to duel or what?"

"Why is that guy leaving?"

"Not sure, but at least the apex isn't going anywhere."

He turned his attention back to Kai, who was scowling at him.

Azriel's smile evaporated in an instant.

""!!""

Suddenly, as if a switch had been flipped, the room fell into a suffocating silence, the air growing thick with tension.

Kai, catching the shift in the atmosphere, instinctively took a few steps back, his teeth clenched tightly.

"Huh?"

Only to feel his back press against something cold and hard.

Chapter 56: Vergil
Kai felt a chill run down his spine as he instinctively leaped forward.

Spinning around, he realized his back had collided with something cold—a wall of ice.

He hadn't even noticed when the wall had formed, nor had he sensed any mana fluctuation from Azriel.

Kai's face grew grim as he quickly turned to face Azriel again, but before he could react—

Cra...Crackle—!

"Gah!"

Without warning, Azriel's fist slammed into Kai's solar plexus, sending him flying back into the ice wall, which shattered upon impact.

Crack—!

Kai stumbled towards the edge of the arena, crashing into the wall as students above looked on in shock.

Bam—!

Most of the spectators were first-year students, either barely awakened or still dormant.

All they saw was a streak of red lightning where Azriel had stood, followed by Kai crumpling to the ground, gasping for breath, his body wracked with violent coughs.

"He must be serious..."

Lumine remarked.

Celestina shook her head, her gaze fixed on Azriel, who stood coldly watching Kai struggle.

"He isn't."

Yelena and Lumine looked at her in confusion, while Nol, oblivious, continued watching Azriel with a bucket of food in hand, like a child engrossed in his favorite movie.

'His face isn't the same as it was at the banquet.'

Celestina thought, recalling the duel with Caleus.

This time, his expression wasn't blank.

'He's not suppressing his emotions.'

"...He's just toying with Cadet Kai."

*****

Step—!

Each step Azriel took echoed through the arena, drawing the attention of every spectator.

Step—!

No one wanted to miss his next move.

Step—!

When Azriel arrived in front of Kai, who was breathing heavily on his hands and knees, he simply looked coldly down at him.

He didn't attack. He didn't move. He just stared down at Kai.

The students watching were puzzled.

Why wasn't Azriel finishing him off?

It was clear Kai couldn't continue—he hadn't even had a chance to draw a weapon.

Azriel had reduced him to this state with a single punch.

It was also strange that the instructors hadn't called the match yet.

Kai, finally stabilizing his breathing, looked up at Azriel and glared.

"...Who was it?"

"What?"

Azriel remained unaffected by Kai's tone and asked again.

"Who told you to lie using my name?"

Kai gritted his teeth at the question.

"I don't kno—"

"Listen."

Azriel suddenly interjected.

"I'm giving you a chance here. Tell me the name, and I won't do anything to you. But make no mistake, I'm not afraid to get blood on my hands. No instructor will stop me until you either surrender—which you're too prideful to do—or until I beat you unconscious."

Azriel narrowed his eyes.

"And if you don't comply, I will make sure you end up in the infirmary... slow and painfully."

Kai merely grinned, flashing his teeth at Azriel.

"You said it yourself... I'm too prideful, so why the hell would I sell out his name?"

Azriel raised his eyebrows in curiosity.

"His?"

Kai's grin faltered as he realized his mistake.

'Unfortunately, I can't harm him too much...'

Normally, the instructors would have ended the duel by now, but since Azriel was both an apex and a prince, they were probably giving him some leeway.

Besides...

'I already know who it was anyway.'

Azriel didn't really need to hear the name from Kai's mouth since he had figured it out before even stepping into the arena.

What he was doing now was simply trying to rein Kai in.

'He could become an important asset in the future.'

That's why he wouldn't kill him outside the academy, even if Kai didn't give him the name.

Azriel, though concerned about his tarnished reputation and trying to rebuild it, wouldn't take a life over something like this.

But this was a good opportunity to get Kai under control.

Azriel crouched down, leaning in to whisper in Kai's ear.

"I could take your life the moment you step outside the academy. You know that, right?"

Kai's face hardened.

"Then I simply won't step outside the academy."

A smile appeared on Azriel's face.

"Have you forgotten about the Void Dungeon trip next week? We won't be on academy grounds then."

"...You still can't do anything. The instructors there won't let you."

Kai continued.

"Academy grounds or not, I'm still a student, and we're technically under the protection of the instructors."

Azriel's smile widened.

"Do you think you'll be under protection the entire time? Do you think the instructors will hold your hand 24/7 in the Void Dungeon? Tell me—do you want to take down Void creatures and get stronger, or would you rather hide behind an instructor's back, paranoid, not knowing when I'll come for you for the rest of your life?"

Kai hesitated, clearly troubled by the choice.

"You're a cadet wanting to be a hero. Don't let your pride rob you of that opportunity. I don't resent you and will simply let you go after you give me his name."

Kai looked into Azriel's eyes.

"You promise?"

Azriel nodded.

"You have my word."

After a few moments of silence, with the students watching in confusion, the stillness was abruptly broken.

"His... name is—"

"Seriously, I didn't think you'd bend under the pressure. Color me impressed!"

A voice suddenly cut through the arena.

Thud—!

Azriel turned to see the source of the voice landing gracefully in the arena.

The newcomer wore the academy uniform and had onyx eyes and obsidian black hair tied in a ponytail that reached his shoulders.

A wry smile was plastered on his face as he gazed at Azriel.

"Honestly, I might have underestimated you, Prince Azriel. Who would have thought you'd go this far? I assumed you wouldn't even enter the arena."

The students nearby exchanged puzzled looks and murmured among themselves about the new arrival.

"What's going on here?"

"I have no idea. Who is that guy?"

"Don't tell me the Apex is going to fight him now too."

"Wait, isn't that..."

Kai, visibly paling, managed to stand up with unsteady legs and took a few slow steps back.

This was something one wouldn't expect from a rank 9 student.

Azriel gave Kai a brief glance before turning his attention to the approaching student.

'He must have broken his pride.'

The newcomer stopped an arm's length away from Azriel, their faces now close.

The arena fell silent once more.

"...Vergil."

Chapter 57: Void Streamer
Vergil was what one would typically call a villain in the original book—constantly creating trouble for the protagonist behind the scenes, making life even more difficult than it already was.

But despite being labeled a villain, he was also one of the main characters in the story.

Not much was known about his background, as it wasn't revealed in the first half of the book.

The only thing known about Vergil was that he was a...

Void Streamer.

In this age, the term referred to content creators who live-streamed their fights against Void creatures, generating income from their dangerous exploits.

Vergil was renowned as one of the youngest and most successful Void Streamers.

Almost no one dared to gamble with their life like Vergil did, fighting Void creatures at such a young age.

He was notorious for illegally streaming his battles in death zones, often taking on Beast-ranked Void creatures.

Perhaps that's why he became so popular.

After certain events, Lumine and Vergil had no choice but to work together, eventually becoming friends.

Vergil wasn't overshadowed by the protagonist; in fact, what Azriel liked most about the book was that each main character had their moments to shine.

But Vergil?

He was a fan favorite—unpredictable, smart, and... reckless.

'I thought he'd not attend on the first day, given his personality, but...'

Now it made sense why Lumine had gotten into a duel on that first day—it was all orchestrated by Vergil.

Vergil raised his eyebrows in surprise.

"Didn't think you'd know my name."

A smile cracked on Azriel's face.

"Didn't think you'd use my name to start a fight."

Vergil laughed wryly, scratching his cheek.

"I guess that's my fault. But can you blame me? I was curious about the Apex who's also the king of rumors."

Azriel raised his eyebrows.

"So, to satisfy your curiosity, you make Cadet Kai—one of the top students in the academy—your pawn, and use him to lie to a friend of mine to bait me out?"

Vergil shook his head.

"I didn't think you'd actually jump in and handle everything yourself. I thought a little duel between the second rank and the ninth rank of the first years on the first day would be fun. I didn't expect you to figure it out before the duel even started."

'...He's not lying.'

Azriel hadn't expected a deep reason behind all of this, but what didn't make sense was—

"Why did you use my name in the first place, knowing I'd figure it out eventually?"

Vergil was reckless, but not stupid.

So why would he do something knowing that Azriel would come for him?

"Why, huh..."

Vergil muttered, turning his head to glance at the confused students.

They couldn't hear the conversation since he and Azriel were speaking too quietly.

Azriel furrowed his brows slightly.

The stares of the students were beginning to get on his nerves.

He wasn't a fan of being the center of attention—it was as if his body rejected it.

But unfortunately, he knew he had to get used to it.

Vergil met Azriel's eyes.

"I guess it's like you said... for my own curiosity."

After those words, there was only silence.

Then, Azriel sighed.

"...I see."

Without another word, Azriel suddenly turned around.

Vergil looked puzzled as Azriel's back grew more distant.

"You're just leaving? You're not going to fight or get angry at me?"

His voice was loud enough for the other students to hear, most of whom were either annoyed or impatient, eager to see another fight with the Apex.

Seeing Azriel suddenly walking away from Vergil left them even more confused.

Azriel stopped in his tracks and turned around, meeting Vergil's eyes directly.

"You're telling me that after seeing through me, you're just going to walk away like that?"

Azriel blinked a few times.

"I already got what I wanted."

That was all Azriel said before turning away again, leaving a bewildered Vergil behind as the students began murmuring among themselves.

*****

"Cadet Vergil, ranked fourth among the first years... what a little devil he is."

Ranni remarked with a chuckle as she and Solomon observed everything unnoticed by the others.

"You're calling him a devil after what Azriel just did?"

Solomon replied with a grin.

Ranni didn't respond immediately.

"Or are you sulking because Azriel didn't use his sword art against Cadet Kai or Cadet Vergil?"

Solomon teased.

Ranni turned toward Solomon, her eyes narrowing.

"You seem to have taken a liking to the boy, Solomon. Did hell freeze over?"

Solomon raised his eyebrows in mock surprise.

"No, but I did see some flying pigs at the Sunken Islands."

A scowl appeared on Ranni's face.

"What? You went to the Voidrealm on your own again?"

Turning his face away, Solomon pretended not to hear her and whistled innocently.

Given the recent events in Europe and the increasing number of Void rifts appearing across Asia, most Saints had been requested by the Four Great Clans to stay on Earth in case of an emergency.

But it seemed Solomon had ignored that directive.

Ranni sighed.

"Well, anyway... Cadet Azriel managed to beat Cadet Kai easily."

Solomon scoffed.

"Of course he did. While that brute only has muscles, Azriel has intelligence and speed. Hell, his speed is on par with that purple-haired brat's—and he even surpassed him at the banquet."

"So it's true. He managed to defeat Cadet Caleus."

Solomon nodded proudly.

"It is. The rumors about him being in the Voidrealm, then ending up in Europe and resisting a Titan-ranked Void creature's mind attack for 15 minutes, only to later defeat Caleus—those are all true."

Ranni's eyes widened in shock.

"What... what did you just say?"

Solomon looked at her with an innocent expression, blinking as if he didn't understand her reaction.

"What do you mean?"

Ranni gritted her teeth, her voice sharper.

"That part about him being in Europe and encountering a Titan-ranked Void creature!"

"Oh, that!"

Solomon suddenly smiled, as if he'd just pulled off a prank.

There had been no rumors about Azriel being in Europe at all, and the fact that he had countered a Titan-ranked Void creature was even more baffling to Ranni.

Many operations in Europe had been halted, and soldiers were retreating because they had no idea what was happening there.

High-ranking Void creatures had been appearing in countries far from where they were originally reported, and no one knew how or why.

"Right, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone about that... well, what's done is done."

Solomon admitted, shrugging.

"When was he in Europe?"

Solomon thought for a few seconds before answering.

"Well, Ragnar and I found him three months ago. Gods, his hair was awful—made me think of a mini Joaquin. I went to fetch him because Ragnar was being a little girl, scared he might be a skinwalker."

Solomon continued, smirking at the memory.

"He even thought Azriel might be some defiled skinwalker since the Leviathan had suddenly disappeared—Ragnar suspected Azriel might be responsible. Anyway, some stupid fog attacked Azriel's mind when I went to get him. Luckily, he survived, but the fog ran away crying..."

Ranni looked skeptical.

"A fog? And that fog was a Titan-ranked Void creature? You mean the Crying Fog?"

Solomon nodded.

It was one of the few recorded Void creatures that hadn't inexplicably appeared in a different country.

"It was."

"And how can you be sure it's a Titan-ranked Void creature?"

Ranni asked, her gaze questioning.

Solomon met her eyes.

"Azriel told me."

Ranni furrowed her brows, doubtful.

"And you believe him?"

"I do,"

Solomon replied confidently.

Ranni sighed once again.

"If you say so..."

She looked back at the arena, where Vergil and Kai were still standing.

Azriel had already left.

"We have a lot of interesting students this year."

Chapter 58: Gods, Apostles, and Dreams
Hearing a knock on his door, Azriel walked over and opened it.

A student stood there, wearing an awkward smile as he faced Azriel.

Smiling, Azriel stepped aside and gestured for the student to enter.

"Welcome to the room of The Apex... Cadet Vergil."

Vergil could only laugh awkwardly as he stepped inside.

"Damn, it's like a 7-star hotel room... while mine's only a 5."

"Well, that's one of the perks of being the Apex, I suppose."

Azriel replied, heading toward the kitchen.

"Why don't you have a seat and tell me why you decided to visit my room at 2 a.m.?"

Following Azriel, Vergil sat down at the counter while Azriel opened the cabinets.

"You want Nebula Spirits, Frost Ember, Duskfall Bourbon, or... Crimson Flame?"

Azriel asked, listing off the bottles.

"Alcohol at 2 a.m.?"

Vergil raised an eyebrow.

Azriel turned toward him, raising his own.

"You got a problem with that?"

Vergil grinned.

"Nope. I'll have Crimson Flame."

"Good choice."

Azriel nodded, picking up two glasses and the bottle of Crimson Flame.

He poured the red liquid and sat down next to Vergil.

"My dear sister told me I wasn't allowed to drink alone anymore... I guess this shouldn't be a problem."

Azriel remarked as he handed over the glass.

Vergil laughed.

"You've got a protective sister."

'Yet she didn't take away her bottle collection for some reason.'

He knew to whom the bottles belonged, and he had always wondered why she left that letter.

They both drank quietly, the air between them strange and tense until...

"You're not going to—"

"Be a dick like you were back at the arena?"

Azriel interrupted, speaking lightly.

"All I wanted was to know who and why, and I got my answers."

"You're not going to come after me? Get revenge?"

"Nope."

"Why?"

Vergil was genuinely curious about Azriel.

For a prince who had punched Kai, he didn't seem vengeful at all.

Vergil had expected Azriel to be angry about his visit or what had happened earlier that day, but there was no sign of anger from him.

"Because I'm not interested in you."

What better revenge is there for someone trying to get your attention?

Ignore them.

Fighting, beating up, or giving Vergil any more attention than necessary would probably be exactly what Vergil wanted—something Azriel obviously wasn't going to do.

'I'm not going to play his games; he'll be dealing with mine instead.'

He wasn't interested in Vergil's reasons, especially after Vergil made it personal by using his name.

There was no way Azriel was going to buy the 'I was curious' excuse.

With the knowledge from the book, Azriel knew how to hurt Vergil the most: by ignoring him.

And Azriel planned to keep doing that until...

"Haa... fine, I'm sorry."

Vergil apologized.

"I shouldn't have underestimated you... When did you figure me out?"

Azriel smiled.

"Figure what out? That you were trying to test me even though I'm a prince?"

Vergil didn't respond, making Azriel sigh.

"It was the moment I caught you glancing at my left arm."

Azriel said, bringing his left arm onto the counter and pulling up his academy sleeve, which he was still wearing like Vergil.

He revealed an arm covered in bandages.

Vergil didn't look surprised as he silently watched Azriel remove the bandages, revealing...

His mark.

"...To think my own eyes betrayed me back then... still, that's one seriously creepy tattoo."

A chuckle escaped Azriel's lips as he brought the glass of Crimson Flame to them.

"That's why I cover it up. Plus, I don't want my family to find out their son is actually a delinquent."

Vergil raised his eyebrows.

"Or an Apostle, but it's not like they would know... I hope."

Azriel shook his head with a sigh.

"You certainly are straightforward at the most convenient times... Anyway, are you going to reveal yours?"

Vergil laughed awkwardly, turning his head slightly.

"…You really want me to strip?"

"…Huh?"

Coughing slightly, Vergil faced him.

"I mean, my mark is on my chest."

Suppressing a twitch of his lips, Azriel spoke.

"You're really embarrassed to show me your chest, like I'm your boyfriend or something?"

Vergil furrowed his brows.

"Wait, why am I the girlfriend?"

"Because I sure as hell wouldn't be afraid to show my chest right now."

Clicking his tongue, Vergil turned away.

"Fine, I am embarrassed. It's not like you need to see anyway, right?"

Azriel shook his head.

"I don't, but at the very least, tell me which god you belong to."

For a few seconds, Vergil stared at his half-empty glass, twirling it before gulping it down in one go.

"The god of Dreams... meaning I am the—"

"Apostle of Dreams."

Azriel finished the sentence, looking at him curiously.

Even in the book, it was never mentioned what apostle Vergil was.

It wasn't even confirmed if he was one, though it was hinted at multiple times.

And considering how Vergil had made Lumine's life difficult, only for Lumine to end up...

'...getting stronger.'

"So, do you know what apostle I am?"

Vergil nodded.

"Apostle of Death... Seriously, the tattoo and the name, downright ominous if I have to say."

'Well, he's right.'

Out of all the apostles, one might think Azriel would be the most villainous.

Maybe that's why Vergil was trying to test him to see where he exactly stood.

A sigh escaped his lips.

"Then you can tell me how you knew I am the Apostle of Death?"

Vergil nodded.

"What else but a dream..."

"A dream?"

"Yes, a dream."

"And? What did you see that led us to be sitting here, drinking buddies?"

"...Give me a refill first."

'Since when did I go from a prince to a bartender?'

Azriel thought, but he complied, refilling Vergil's glass and waiting patiently as Vergil took another sip, sighing.

"Two years ago, I once had a dream—or at least I think it was a dream."

'Wait, don't tell me he's about to give his life story now?'

Azriel wanted to groan.

He wasn't interested in Vergil's life story; he just wanted to know how Vergil had identified him as the Apostle of Death.

It was 2 a.m., and Azriel needed sleep whenever he could get it because sleeping long hours was already difficult for him.

"I was walking forward on a bridge, my feet carrying me without me being able to move my own body. All around me was just... stars. It was like I was in space."

Vergil continued.

"Then, at the end of that bridge, I saw something... I don't know what I saw."

Furrowing his brows, Azriel looked at Vergil, who was gritting his teeth as cracks formed on the glass he was holding.

'...That's an expensive glass.'

"I can't remember. But whatever it was, it made me return to my room in the next second, and all I could think about was how scared I was. I don't think I've ever been more scared in my life, and I haven't been since."

Vergil's body was shaking slightly.

He locked eyes with Azriel.

"But since that day, I knew three words in my mind which I didn't know before: Gods, Apostles, and Dreams."

"...."

"I haven't had a dream like that since then... until—"

"Until you came to the academy."

Vergil nodded as Azriel finished for him.

'Whatever he saw shook him so badly that he forced himself to forget, and...'

It explained Vergil's reckless behavior.

But what had Vergil seen?

The God of Dreams?

Azriel shook his head slightly.

'I better not even go there.'

"The day after the entrance exam, I finally had another dream."

'Finally, we're getting there.'

"Instead of being on that bridge, I walked in a field of lilies... It was a field painted with them, and in the middle stood a throne."

Vergil narrowed his eyes.

"You were sitting on that throne."

Azriel nodded.

'The throne must have represented my title as Apex, and the lilies as... death.'

He didn't think Vergil knew about flowers, so it was an interesting discovery.

"I also saw another thing."

Azriel furrowed his brows.

"What was it?"

"After that, I found myself in a forest. Everything was green and so alive, filled with animals. I then saw a strange butterfly... that butterfly was different from every other animal there and... was beautiful."

'I wish I could have seen it.'

Azriel didn't really have an opinion on butterflies, but he was curious about the one Vergil saw.

"I ran after it, and when I did, I saw it land on the head of another student..."

Azriel sighed as he realized what Vergil was saying.

"Lumine Versille. Apostle of—"

"Life."

Vergil finished the sentence, making Azriel break into a smile.

'So it's true. In the book, Vergil was trying to make Lumine stronger in his own way.'

A way that made him seem like the bad guy.

Vergil was limited in how he could do that without making Lumine suspicious.

It was the easiest method he must have thought of.

'To go to such lengths... everyone here really is a good person in the end.'

It made Azriel feel out of place.

"...I told you the reasons for my actions. You could call it my way of actually apologizing. I won't ask you how you knew about the apostles... not until I can earn your trust, of course, and you tell me yourself."

It seemed like Vergil wanted to have a relationship with Azriel—though not a romantic one.

Azriel didn't say anything, lost in thought.

He didn't hate Vergil for what he did and understood him as well.

In fact, having someone to talk to about these things lightened his chest a little.

He didn't want to speak to Lumine about the apostles and gods yet.

Instead, he preferred that Lumine found out himself.

"...So you want us to be friends?"

Vergil nodded immediately.

"I do."

Azriel sighed for the umpteenth time that day.

He didn't mind becoming friends with Vergil, who was also the Apostle of Dreams.

Someone who was genuinely a good person.

Having him around would only benefit Azriel.

He wanted to be friends with the main characters, so it worked.

It's just...

'I feel conflicted about befriending them for my own gain...'

But it was not like he had a choice when an opportunity presented itself.

And so...

"Let's have another drink. To our new friendship."

Vergil smiled as Azriel tried to match his smile while refilling their glasses.

The plot of the book had already been altered by Azriel's involvement.

He had no idea what was going to happen next.

'It's better to destroy the future and build a new one.'

Azriel knew exactly where the future in the book was headed.

'...As long as I can save this world and create a future for myself, it's worth it.'

Stronger heroes are needed. The plot had to be broken into pieces, and some sacrifices were necessary.

But...

'I'll make sure to save you, Vergil.'

They were friends now, and Azriel wasn't going to let him die.

Especially not at the end of the first half.

Chapter 59: Mana Theory
The room was dim, lit only by a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling, flickering on and off like a dying heartbeat.

It was the kind of scene ripped straight out of a movie: an old wooden table stood in the center, worn and splintered with age.

Behind the table sat a man, head bowed, his face twisted in anguish as he clenched his fists.

Click—!

The door creaked open, and a man in a black coat and hat stepped inside, a cigarette hanging from his lips. He wore black gloves and boots, and his entire outfit was a deep, impenetrable black.

Step—!

His footsteps echoed through the room, each one a heavy, deliberate sound.

Step—!

With each step, the man at the table shuddered, his body betraying his fear.

Step—!

The man in black finally stopped in front of the table. With a swift motion—

Thwip—!

—he dropped a stack of papers onto the table.

The seated man's eyes widened in horror as he saw the photos. His wife. His kids. Smiling, laughing, completely unaware.

Pictures of them at home, out shopping, even asleep.

"...I told you I would find them, didn't I?"

"P-Please... don't hurt them."

The man in black sighed deeply and took a seat across from him.

"That depends on you. Do what we told you, and I give you my word—not a single finger will be laid on them."

Tears welled up in the man's eyes as his body shook with silent sobs.

"What... What you're asking me to do..."

He whispered, his voice choking off as his teeth clenched tighter.

The man in black stood up again, slowly removing the cigarette from his mouth.

Huff...

He exhaled a cloud of smoke, the haze lingering in the dim light.

Adjusting his hat, he crushed the cigarette under his boot and began to walk away.

Pausing at the door, he spoke one last time.

"You're a good person, but this world won't survive on good people. This... is the least you can do to make sure your family does."

With that, he left, the door creaking open and then slamming shut behind him.

The man at the table was left alone, tears streaming down his face as he stared at the pictures of his family.

"...I'm sorry... Please, forgive me."

*****

"Haa... Seriously, I'm going to die! There's no way I'm surviving the rest of these classes!"

Students slumped over their desks, exhausted and miserable. They looked like they'd just stumbled out of a torture chamber, their faces pale and their bodies trembling.

The day had begun with Instructor Solomon forcing all the students of HCS-1 to run laps around the entire academy for two relentless hours.

There had been no introductions, no easing into the day—just endless running, with Solomon grinning like a maniac the entire time.

After those brutal hours, they were grudgingly allowed to shower and change back into their academy uniforms from the sweat-soaked sports clothes they had been forced to wear.

Apparently, what they had endured was just a "warm-up" in Solomon's eyes.

"Tell me about it... I swear, one day I'm going to wipe that smile off his face!"

"How are we supposed to survive the rest of our classes?"

"At least we should get a break after our Mana Theory class with Instructor Salvator."

"I swear, if he's as crazy as Instructor Ranni or Solomon, I'm done. I'll end it right here."

Complaints flew around the room as the students vented their frustrations, chatting lazily in their exhaustion.

"Hey, but seriously..."

One of the classmates suddenly lowered his voice.

"Those two aren't human..."

The others nodded in agreement.

"Right? They must be skinwalkers or something."

"Instructor Solomon even said he'd give those two different tasks to do."

"It's like they're from another world..."

"Basically, they are. But yeah, I wish we could talk to them too."

The two they were referring to were obviously Azriel and Lumine.

The other students glanced at them—Azriel was watching Celestina with interest as she lay with her head down on the desk, fatigued.

Lumine was beside her, trying to cheer up Yelena, who was in the same state.

They were all seated in the same spots as the day before.

It had become an unspoken rule that they would sit at the front from now on.

"I mean, Lumine seems approachable, but..."

"Yeah, Azriel Crimson... There are so many rumors about him, especially after what happened at the arena."

The other students nodded.

"One punch was all it took to knock out the ninth-ranked student of our year... What's his deal?"

"At least he's handsome, even if the rumors are true..."

"A handsome delinquent prince... I could go for that."

The boys felt a pang of jealousy as the girls muttered among themselves.

"What about Princess Celestina...?" One of the boys asked.

The others nodded, thinking.

"She doesn't belong to our world either... But do you think she's with Prince Azriel?"

One student shrugged.

"I heard a rumor that the children of the four great clans often get together, so maybe that's why?"

"Is that so? Hey, you should go talk to them."

"Huh? Why me? You go."

"Ugh... No way."

It seemed the topic of conversation always revolved around the four top students in the class.

It was obvious they had the strongest class among the first years, boasting four of the top ten students: the Apex, the second, third, and sixth ranks.
