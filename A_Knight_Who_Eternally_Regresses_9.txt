"Hello again."
He raised his hand in greeting, and Enkrid performed a military salute by pressing his left hand to his hip.
"Can we talk?"
"With me?"
"Who else?"
Enkrid pointed at himself, blinking, then nodded. As he turned to calm everyone, he flinched. Rem, Ragna, and Jaxon stood behind him. They had moved so quickly and silently he hadn’t noticed.
"That guy with the bad habits."
Rem said. Ragna and Jaxon remained silent. Torres raised his hands.
"I’m not here to fight."
The tension between the four was palpable. The air in the quarters grew thick. Torres broke the silence.
"They call you the Troublemaker Squad, and you live up to the name."
Torres showed his displeasure. It looked like a fight could break out at any moment. At that moment, Enkrid stepped between them. Blocking his squad members with his back, Enkrid spoke.
"Let’s go outside."
If a fight broke out, it would be hard to manage. As they stepped out, Rem snorted loudly. Outside, as they walked, Torres frowned and spoke.
"Why are they like that? Are they frustrated? Tell them to visit the red-light district. Don’t think about spilling blood."
Torres had seen what Enkrid hadn't. When the door opened, Rem, the superior-beater, moved first. His step carried killing intent as he stood behind Enkrid. The one who was lying on the bed then silently stood behind Enkrid.
At that moment, Torres had a vision of an impenetrable shield before Enkrid. He lost sight of the last one, the red-haired man, who was also standing and watching him. Killing intent pierced and tore him apart. Torres’s nerves were on edge. His pride hurt, realizing a wrong move could have gotten him killed.
‘By just three regular soldiers?’
The Troublemaker Squad’s reputation was well-known. But not to this extent. Had Enkrid not intervened, would the situation have turned laughable?
When facing Enkrid before, Torres had only shown half his skill. It was enough. Could he handle one of the three?
The direct force was considered the best trained and talented, except for the knight orders. The Frontier Slaughterers, especially, had proven their prowess.
Pride was at stake.
But work was work, and he had to say what he came for. Torres took a few breaths to calm himself.
"Let me be direct."
He had an assignment and he carried it out.
"Join the Frontier Slaughterers."
The direct army, the Frontier Slaughterers, was a proposal beyond the heavy infantry. It was the royal army. The unit received orders directly from the royal army, not the Cyprus Brigade.
An attractive offer.
"What do you think?"
Torres's attitude was confident. His pride in being part of the Frontier Slaughterers was evident. Enkrid looked at Torres and spoke.
"What is the aim of the Frontier Slaughterers?"
What could a soldier achieve by joining?
Where was he heading as a soldier?
Enkrid asked.
Chapter 54: The Turtle and the Frontier Slaughterer (3)
What aim, what purpose, and what goal do you exist for?
A hawk that had been wandering the green plains flew overhead. The hawk's cry echoed between them. It was a not-so-cold winter day. Enkrid, standing by the wall within the unit, responded to the proposal with a question.
Torres paused. He thought for a moment before speaking.
"The soldier ranking system is bullshit, but it did establish one clear standard. What defines a special-rank soldier."
His voice was low, deep, and resonant, like a hymn sung in bass. His thoughts aligned with the question. Torres spoke with sincerity and conviction.
"It means reaching the limits of human potential. Soldiers who carve out time from their sleep and swing their swords until their hands blister even on the battlefield."
Torres reached out and grabbed Enkrid's hand. Enkrid allowed him to take it. Turning Enkrid's palm over, Torres spoke.
"Look."
The calluses were hard and cracked, proof of countless hours of training, evidence of the many days spent swinging a sword.
"There are many who put in this much effort but there are few who are followed by talent. Very few."
Torres shook his head slightly as he spoke. He was right. Because of his lack of talent, Enkrid knew all too well, having scraped and crawled all this time.
"A unit where soldiers who combine effort and talent, reaching the limits of human potential gather. That's the Frontier Slaughterers. If you want to improve your skills, join our unit. It will fill in your shortcomings."
He had asked about their aim, but the answer was about filling in shortcomings. Enkrid found his answer there. Seeing the passion and desire in his eyes, Enkrid spoke.
"I'm sorry."
It was a rejection.
It could have been an excellent opportunity. A path toward a dream he hadn’t forgotten, a dream he couldn’t forget, no matter how torn apart it was.
But Enkrid couldn’t go. The Frontier Slaughterers might be a step up, but the end of those steps wouldn’t lead to the world he wanted.
‘Stopping at the limit isn’t an option.’
Reaching the limit wasn’t enough.
The Frontier Slaughterers, the unit stationed in Border Guard, were the most lethal force. But even the member standing in front of him, glaring, had said it himself. The Frontier Slaughterers were those who reached the limits of human potential. Enkrid’s dream was higher than that.
Of course, thinking one could surpass the limit without even reaching it was arrogance. But it wasn’t an option to stop halfway, predicting he wouldn’t reach his destination.
Enkrid shook his head.
"You know our unit’s specialty?"
They turn regular soldiers into efficient killing machines in a short time.
He knew. There was no mediocre training. They were a group that trained soldiers far beyond the level of regular soldiers.
But the method was the problem. In fact, Enkrid's question had only one implicit inquiry.
Among those in the Frontier Slaughterers, were there any who became knights?
No.
They learned and mastered the most convenient and efficient way to kill. They weren’t called the Frontier Slaughterers for nothing. In terms of swordsmanship, they prioritized tricks and irregular techniques over fundamentals. Tricks and irregular techniques wouldn’t make one a knight.
Knowing that, he couldn’t take that path.
"You're an idiot."
But to others, it might seem this way. Torres relaxed his gaze.
"People say that often."
"Ha, I never thought I’d get rejected by a man. Can I ask why?"
Should he tell? Would it just earn him more ridicule?
Talking about his dream had only ever brought ridicule. Oh, except for one time.
'Crang was serious.'
Other than that, Rem found it a good excuse to tease. No one else reacted well either. A few instructors showed what it meant to look at someone like they were crazy.
"I aim higher than the Frontier Slaughterers."
Even so, Enkrid spoke honestly. There was nothing to hide.
"Higher?"
"I want the Red Cloak."
It didn’t necessarily have to be the Red Cloak. But it was a fitting metaphor.
There was only one knight order in Naurillia. They were the king’s guard, draped in red cloaks like blood, the symbol of Naurillia’s might. They were the only unit allowed to bear the king’s emblem. On their cloaks was the vivid emblem of three crossed swords, the symbol of the kingdom.
The three swords with crossed blades and the mythical beast with a round head and flaming mane, the Sun Beast. These were the symbols of Naurillia.
Becoming a knight. Torres understood enough. And he was bewildered.
"...That's a bit much."
Torres had gauged Enkrid’s skill. It was impressive. For someone who discovered his talent at thirty, it was remarkable.
But that was it.
In fact, his skills were borderline for acceptance into the Frontier Slaughterers. His squad members might have a different reason for their capability.
‘They wouldn't make it either.’
They were problematic. No matter how troublesome, soldiers had to obey commands. They were below standard in that respect. A weapon that harmed its wielder wasn’t a good weapon.
It was something to discard.
"Are you serious?"
"Of course."
He was rejected cleanly. Torres nodded. He didn’t want to crush his dreams.
But this had to be said.
"You'll regret it."
"Maybe."
Enkrid replied sincerely. Not every choice was always right, and he might regret it.
Torres, the platoon leader of the Frontier Slaughterers, didn’t even salute and turned around. He seemed light-hearted rather than sulking. Enkrid watched Torres leave and turned around.
As he walked back to the quarters, he recalled his conversation with Ragna.
"Are you talking about the Red Cloak Knights? Are you curious about how they move like that?"
The shock from seeing a Red Cloak Knight wasn’t small.
What is a knight?
How could they move like that?
It would be a lie to say it didn’t raise questions. Moreover, the knight was only an apprentice knight.
"It’s a bit early to know now."
Ragna had said, and Enkrid waited quietly for his next words. As expected, Ragna continued.
"Knights don’t just use muscle strength. Their bodies harbor a very special power. It’s not the time to discuss it now. Knowing would only be a hindrance."
"Just point me in the right direction. I want to know if I'm on the wrong path."
It might be a demanding request. But as Enkrid’s skills improved, he realized his squad members were no ordinary people.
Among them, he had learned the basics of swordsmanship from Ragna, and he noticed. If there was anyone in the squad closest to being a knight, it was Ragna.
"Fundamentals are a series of simple and straightforward techniques. You’ll know if you fight, but is it quicker to build skills based on the mercenary swordsmanship you learned, or to build skills by honing the basics?"
Why are tricks considered tricks?
Why are irregular techniques irregular?
If it was just about fighting well, Vallen’s mercenary swordsmanship was much better than the basic heavy sword techniques.
"To go further, you must follow the right path. I believe that answers your question."
It was more than enough of an answer.
Swordsmanship advanced through fundamentals. Overcoming numerous obstacles by walking the right path. That was the task at hand.
Enkrid concluded as such.
"Growl."
Entering the quarters, he was greeted by a beast's growl. The place was a mess. The beds were pushed aside, and a table was overturned. Kraiss was sitting with a scratched face, looking miserable.
"Damn, it’s my face."
"Quick reflexes."
“Panther meat isn’t tasty, but it’s still meat."
Ragna and Rem commented as they observed the situation.
It was a beast, a black panther. A young panther with blue eyes, like the one they had fought alongside before. It had disappeared, and he thought he wouldn’t see it again.
But somehow, it had found its way here.
The panther bristled, glaring at Ragna and Rem, but when Enkrid entered, it turned and snuggled into Enkrid’s arms.
Rem scratched his head with his thumb, the axe still in his hand. Had he been a moment late, that axe might have beheaded the panther.
"Is it your pet, Squad Leader?"
"Um, something like that."
Ragna, who had been serious when talking about knights, returned to his lazy self. He sheathed his sword and threw himself on the bed that had been pushed aside. Seeing this, Rem also put down his axe.
"Is it yours? That thing’s quite ferocious."
Kraiss cautiously looked at the panther and asked.
"Did it scratch you?"
"I was just trying to pet its head."
As Kraiss spoke, gesturing to his wounds, Rem laughed.
"He got scratched trying to see if it was a male or female."
"Caak!"
The intelligent panther bared its fangs, as if it understood. Startled, Kraiss stumbled back, tripping over a leather waterskin and falling. Rem burst out laughing at Kraiss, who landed on his rear.
"You okay? Your face?"
Enkrid asked, smiling slightly. Kraiss always boasted that his face was Naurillia’s blessing.
"I’m fine. I’ll just apply some holy treatment or ointment to prevent scars."
Holy treatment for such a minor wound?
Only someone swimming in krona would think of that.
"Sure."
He replied absently, looking at the panther in his arms. The panther, which had been baring its fangs, now raised its head quietly.
It wasn’t as light or small as it seemed, but in his arms, it felt light and small.
"Did you come to visit?"
Enkrid asked. The panther understood. It blinked, let out a small growl, and rubbed its head against Enkrid’s chest. The soft fur felt very pleasant. Rem, watching Enkrid pet the panther, spoke.
"Are you keeping it? It won’t be boring, at least."
Rem, surprisingly, was kind to animals. Ragna and Jaxon showed no interest. Audin, who had returned from duty, also showed no interest. Rem and Kraiss were the only ones still very interested.
"It’s a female."
"Huh?"
"You think I’d just get scratched on the face?"
Kraiss folded his arms and spoke triumphantly.
“Is that so? How impressive.”
"Yeah."
Enkrid replied and began to tidy up. Rem set up the overturned table and sat on it, asking,
"Now that you’re a high-rank soldier, it seems everyone’s after you. How do you feel? The Frontier Slaughterers don’t seem like a bad option."
Enkrid sometimes wanted to look into that scheming man’s mind. Even though he joked all day, he could hit the mark like that.
"I'm not going."
He said his conclusion first. He didn’t want unnecessary noise.
"Why?"
Jaxon asked. His words were short.
"Sir."
He added the honorific belatedly.
"Just because."
What was there to explain? He was about to let it slide when Rem intervened.
"Are you serious? Even if the soldier ranking system is flawed, high-rank soldiers are exceptional. You turned down the royal army?"
"There must be a reason."
Ragna, seemingly understanding the previous conversation, chimed in, making things worse.
"...Damn it, is he pretending to know something? He seems to know."
"Why?"
Jaxon asked again. This time, the honorific didn’t follow. His gaze was very insolent.
"Lord, grant wisdom to these ignorant ones."
Audin added fuel to the fire with his prayer, igniting the atmosphere. It was impossible to ignore. Leaving it would lead to meaningless violence. Enkrid knew this situation too well from experience. Squad members throwing tantrums often found solutions through displays of force.
"The Frontier Slaughterers stop at the human limit. That’s what they’re for."
"Why is that a problem?"
There was no need to feel pained by that fact. When discussing the path to knighthood with Ragna, Ragna had added,
"A natural talent, a heaven-sent prodigy, in other words, a genius doesn’t need to learn and engrain the basics. They’ll manage on their own."
Knighthood was a genius's game. Those born with talent, among them, the best of the best. Only those who were naturally gifted among the naturally gifted could become knights.
So, should one not even dream?
Should one not hope?
Even if it was torn and shredded, leaving no trace. If not abandoned, that dream still lingered in his heart.
Thus, Enkrid dreamed.
"It’s a problem. My goal is higher."
They all stared blankly. Enkrid spoke. So plainly, so casually as if announcing lamb stew for breakfast.
"I will become a knight."
In the past, this had been met with ridicule.
Enkrid's dream had always been a subject of mockery. So this reaction felt strange.
"You’ll have to cross several walls, but if you want to, you should."
Rem spoke first. Ragna showed the rare fiery look in his eyes.
Jaxon questioned, "Is that so?"
Kraiss opened his mouth in awe. Audin clasped his hands in prayer.
"Bless the effort of holding onto dreams and hopes, even when they seem empty and invisible."
There was no need to be moved by the prayer. Even if it had been met with ridicule, nothing would have changed. Enkrid was that kind of person.
More important than others' mockery or disdain was the dream he held.
A high-rank soldier.
A properly recognized rank in the soldier grading system.
It was just the beginning. Building skills, making a name to become a knight. The panther meowed and tapped Enkrid's cheek. It felt like encouragement.
"Smart one."
Rem laughed at the sight. Despite his nonchalance, Enkrid’s heart fluttered. It was his first time being encouraged instead of ridiculed.
‘Lately, there’s been a lot of firsts.’
It was a joyful moment, no matter what anyone said.
Enkrid spent the next two days training as usual. On the third day, he went on market patrol duty.
Thunk.
And was stabbed in the stomach by a dagger. It was a fatal wound. It felt like a hot iron skewer was shredding his insides.
"Damn it."
Enkrid laughed in disbelief, blood dripping from his mouth. It was a truly unexpected blow.
Screams echoed from the market as a passing waitress screamed. Dying, Enkrid closed his eyes to the sound of her screams.
Chapter 55: To the End of Persistence
It was really no big deal. City patrol duty was a routine task. It was a rotational duty that could be required three or four times a month if frequent.
Moreover, where was this place?
Border Guard.
A city under the direct control of the king, where any significant trouble was not tolerated. It was not for nothing that this place was renowned as a prime trading hub among major merchant groups. In Naurillia, it was a frontier city Bordering the extreme east and Azpen, and although it was the closest city to the battlefield, its public order was second to none.
The large number of garrison troops ensured constant patrols day and night. Border Guard had four inns centered around a well, and the crossroads where these inns met was the marketplace of Border Guard.
Since the city was built on a basin, a gentle slope could be seen going outward, and beyond the northern slope, the river flowed below.
The Pen-Hanil River.
It supplied water to most of the surrounding cities. Around the river were farmlands and farmhouses scattered here and there. In summer, a flood had broken a section of the dyke, and a group of workers were busy rebuilding it.
Most accidents happen among people, though sometimes patrols covered farmland or dealt with monsters. But today was a market patrol duty.
"I'm Jack, and this is Bon."
Since the duty was done in teams of three, two soldiers joined him.
Enkrid, Jack, and Bon. The three of them were heading towards the market.
"That fog was sorcery? Cough! spit! Damn Azpen bastards, I almost died, but thanks to you, I lived. Thanks!"
Jack spat phlegm on the ground as he spoke. The way he swaggered with his infantry spear didn't make him seem genuinely thankful. Enkrid nodded indifferently.
"I almost couldn't use the Krona I saved up."
Bon also expressed his gratitude. He was a particularly light-footed soldier. I had heard from Big Eyes that he was naturally talented.
'But where have I heard this combination before?'
No specific memory came to mind. It wasn't important enough for Enkrid to try to remember. The three walked towards the market, and the atmosphere was good. Enkrid didn't talk much, but Jack and Bon were from the same squad.
They chatted, often praising Enkrid.
"A high-rank soldier, your skills must be incredible. Damn, let's have a spar sometime. I'd love to see a high-rank soldier's prowess."
Jack said, tapping the ground with the back of his spear.
"Sure."
Enkrid didn't refuse the spar. He believed that he could learn something no matter the opponent.
"It's a promise. Damn."
Jack had a habit of ending his sentences with a curse.
"I heard you succeeded in the reconnaissance mission too. Andrew couldn't stop praising you."
Bon also complimented Enkrid.
"It was just luck."
"So humble too."
Bon gave a thumbs up.
No one disliked compliments. Enkrid was no exception. The two continued to laugh and chat as they walked. They reached the edge of the market, passing several one-story buildings as they entered.
On one side, wildflowers were being sold. On the other side, tanned leather was on sale.
Opposite the entrance from where Enkrid came in, the sound of metal being hammered echoed from far away. It was the sound from the blacksmith's shop. Despite being on the outskirts of the market, the faint sound of metal meeting metal tickled the ears.
"Hey, there'll be nothing left if you sell it at that price."
A merchant's voice.
"Freshly baked bread here!"
A boy standing by the roadside, trying to attract customers to his shop.
Rumble, rumble.
A cart rolled through the center of the market. It was chaotic. But this was the usual scene of a market.
"Dried apples are delicious."
While walking, Enkrid made eye contact with a merchant selling various dried fruits.
"No, thanks."
The merchant quickly looked away.
It was an ordinary day. After duty, he thought he might coax Jaxon into a spar, or he would have fun hanging out with that guy, Jack, as soon as he got back. The weather had gotten colder, and his body kept stiffening. Walking was better than staying still.
"Shall we walk a bit more?"
"Yes, yes."
Jack and Bon stuck close to his sides. Just when he thought they were doing it because they were cold, a kid wrapped in rags came stumbling towards them and fell forward.
Enkrid instinctively caught the child.
He felt a sudden, sharp pain. He tried to turn his body immediately, but the cold had made his body stiff, causing a delayed reaction. If he had twisted just a little, it would have been fine, but the dagger unhesitatingly ripped through his innards.
After stabbing his innards, the dagger quickly and precisely struck near his heart in succession. A terrible pain shot through his brain. As the dagger stabbed him, a scream or groan tried to escape his lips, but someone behind him covered his mouth with thick cloth.
The market was bustling. It was busy enough that one person collapsing wouldn't cause much alarm.
Jack and Bon blocked Enkrid with their bodies.
"Oh dear, already drinking at this hour."
Jack joked.
"Indeed."
Bon chimed in.
What the hell, these bastards?
Enkrid couldn't understand what was happening. The final blow was dealt by the kid who had stabbed his abdomen and heart.
"A tenacious lover never forgets."
It wasn't a kid. Inside the rags, he saw big ears and jewel-like eyes. The appearance was distinctive. One eye was green, and the other was brown.
Heterochromia. The green eye shone like a jewel, making the brown eye look incredibly dull by comparison. It was like dirty oil mixed into clear water.
His skin was mottled like a spotted cat, with deep wrinkles around his mouth and eyes. Judging by his features, he had a pretty face, but when combined, it was unpleasant.
'A half-elf.'
Enkrid recognized his assailant. But it didn't change anything.
Blood was pouring onto the ground as he was held by Jack and Bon.
"Goodbye."
The half-elf said. Judging by his wrinkled face and manner of speaking, he wasn't young. Despite his small stature, he looked like a boy of about twelve or thirteen.
'I really didn't see this coming.'
An assassination, and a tenacious lover.
Wasn't that the name of an independent company in Azpen?
They were known for their persistence. After the battle, they sent an assassin.
'These bastards are insane.'
Considering the cost and effort of sending an assassin just to kill a mere soldier this way was certainly crazy. From the victim's perspective, it was even more infuriating. As Enkrid tried to tilt his head back with all his strength, the person covering his mouth tightened their grip.
"Let him go. He seems to have something to say."
Was it the elf's intuition? The small, old half-elf seemed to read Enkrid's mind.
Soon, the thick cloth covering his mouth loosened.
"Did Azpen send you? Are Jack and Bon spies?"
Enkrid asked, swallowing the rising pain.
"Something like that."
"Who’s behind me?"
"Do you want to know even when you're dying?"
"It would be frustrating to go without knowing. I'll be waiting in hell."
"Rot."
The last word was whispered from behind.
Rot?
That name was familiar too.
Jack, Bon, Rot.
All of them were in the reconnaissance unit.
As death approached, his mind spun rapidly, and memories surfaced. The reason he was sent on the reconnaissance mission at the Green Pearl Plain was because Jack had a broken arm, Bon had a broken nose, and Rot had been bitten by a snake.
These bastards had all deliberately avoided the reconnaissance mission?
"Damn it."
A hollow laugh escaped him.
"Was it tenacious?"
The elf said, stepping aside like a picture. He nimbly moved around the outskirts and slipped into an alley.
Jack and Bon quietly let go of his arms and backed away. Rot, of course, wad nowhere to be seen. Talking had drained all his strength. He had no energy left to shout. Even if he did, he wouldn't have shouted. Instead, as he collapsed, he tried to look back.
Although he said it was Rot, he thought it might be someone else.
But what did Rot look like?
He couldn't remember the face. Just as he thought it was meaningless to see, Enkrid relaxed his body. Blood trickled from his mouth, and his innards felt like they were being stirred with kindling. Pain soaked his body, and blood soaked the ground. The cold wrapped around him more intensely. His body trembled.
'Damn bastards, if you're going to leave, finish the job.'
Bleeding out slowly was the worst. It would be better to go all at once.
"Kyaaah!"
A passing waitress screamed when she saw the blood pooling on the ground. That was the last thing he heard. Enkrid closed his eyes and accepted death.
Flash.
Morning, his eyes opened again.
He shot up, and next to him, Rem asked, wrapped in a blanket.
"Nightmare?"
"No. I wanted to start the morning energetically."
"Terribly cold day."
Rem grumbled in the morning. Although a large bonfire was lit in the barracks' drill yard and the night watch heated stones and placed them inside the barracks, it wasn't enough to fend off the cold.
If they had plenty of Krona, they could have brought in fur or magic heaters. But a common soldier didn't have that kind of Krona. Actually, magic heaters weren't even necessary. The hide of a magical beast that emitted a gentle warmth would have been perfect, but even that was expensive.
In conclusion, it was all a pipe dream.
"Kraiss, aren't you cold?"
"Cold. Very."
Rem asked Kraiss needlessly. Big Eyes was the only one here with an abundance of Krona.
"How about a magic heater?"
"Using something nobles use? You've got a fat stomach. Why don't you try being a noble from tomorrow?"
"Eh? Do you want a back massage with an axe blade?"
"Resorting to violence at every turn is a bad habit. Squad Leader!"
At the end of the conversation, Big Eyes turned to Enkrid.
"Don't bully him."
Enkrid's gaze turned to the muscular squad member, who was getting up from his bed.
His name was Audin Pumray.
For some reason, a muscular soldier who had ended up in this squad of troublemakers. Today was a particularly cold day. Jaxon was out on leave for some reason, and Rem, Big Eyes, and Ragna showed no intention of getting out of bed.
Even wrapped up in blankets, it was still cold.
"Since you're up, Squad Leader, could you bring us some stones?"
A few stones heated overnight by the bonfire would help a little.
"Sure."
Even after replying, Enkrid didn't move. Instead, Audin got out of bed and approached him.
"Brother, if you stay in bed because it's cold, your body will stiffen. Move your body to generate heat to fight the cold. Come, follow my lead."
"Screw off. Before I cut you into pieces and warm myself with your blood."
"That's not good. Brother, that remark can be very unpleasant to the listener."
"Unpleasant? Then, I've succeeded. That was my intention."
"Brother, do you want to go to heaven?"
Indeed, always the same. Normally, Enkrid would have intervened much earlier, but today, he just watched Audin silently before speaking.
"You said there's a training method to maintain body heat? Teach me."
Audin, who had been staring intently at Rem, turned his head.
"Do you mean unarmed training?"
Audin wasn't immune to the cold, but he endured it better than the others. He had mentioned before that there was a training method to prevent the body from stiffening even in the cold. Enkrid didn't know why, but he thought of it now.
It seemed useful. Since he couldn't just jump up and down in place to warm himself, learning a method to keep his body from stiffening didn't seem like a bad idea. It was impulsive but also natural.
Enkrid was a man who was always eager to learn.
"Yes, that."
"Teaching it isn't difficult. Do you have time?"
"Now."
"In a day or two, you can grasp the basics. It's not hard."
Audin seemed pleased that Enkrid wanted to learn and smiled. Seeing Enkrid immediately start preparing, Rem mumbled from his bed.
"Hey, Squad Leader, bring us those stones. I'm cold."
Ah, he had forgotten. Enkrid brought the stones first. There were two hours left until duty. It was the perfect time to eat breakfast and train his body.
That's what Enkrid did.
Unarmed training was a series of painful exercises, but it was useful. And then, he went out on duty again.
"How did I end up on duty with you guys?"
Someone must have manipulated the schedule.
"Ah, damn, it's an honor. Serving with the Sorcery Breaker."
Jack answered. Enkrid nodded. Upon entering the market, he was prepared, so when the elf kid approached, he was already on guard. Jack and Bon tried to grab his arms, but Enkrid threw out punches to both sides.
Thud, crack!
Jack was struck on the jaw, and Bon reflexively dodged. Bon was quick. He sidestepped and swiftly moved away. While doing so, he reached for his waist. He had a shortsword strapped to his side.
The elf was still far away. Bon needed to be dealt with first. Enkrid also grasped the handle of his longsword.
He drew and swung it. Concentrating, he sharpened the blade of his senses with courage as his weapon.
Simultaneously.
Whoosh!
He heard a strange sound. He tried to dodge, but something flew at him faster.
Thwack!
For a moment, Enkrid's breath was taken away. Looking down, he saw the tip of a blade embedded near his heart. It was a simple, double-edged throwing knife, with no handle or decoration. Handling such a weapon was extremely difficult.
"A tenacious lover never forgets their prey."
The elf had approached and whispered, stepping aside smoothly.
'I was prepared.'
But he hadn't anticipated a thrown weapon. Even if he had, it would have been hard to block such an expert throw. Enkrid realized he needed better preparation as he closed his eyes.
And the third day began.
Chapter 56: A Wall is a Wall
"Think of it as stretching your muscles, Brother."
Audin's bare-handed training method focused on breaking down and stretching each individual muscle in the body.
"Ugh."
A groan escaped from Enkrid's mouth. His thigh muscles were strained to the point of breaking, and Audin added more pressure by climbing onto Enkrid's bent back.
Enkrid, who was now sitting and reaching his hands towards his toes, spoke up.
"Kill me."
"Is that a threat?"
"I'm dying."
His voice was barely a whisper. It really felt like his muscles were about to tear. Just a few more breaths and it might actually happen! Only when Enkrid was at his limit did Audin finally take his hands off Enkrid's back.
"This is just the basics."
Audin repeated the word "basics" multiple times.
One leg folded inward to press the pelvic muscles. One hand gripping a pillar, half-bending at the waist, and twisting his body. Twisting, stretching, and squeezing the body.
Yes, squeezing. There was no better word for it.
After his body was squeezed like wringed laundry, he was drenched in sweat.
Was this a form of torture?
If this was just the basics, was the advanced course about disassembling a person?
These random thoughts crossed his mind, but the conclusion was that the effects of Audin's gymnastics were outstanding. It was painful during the exercise, but afterward, his body felt significantly lighter.
Not just lighter. His body heated up, and with his heart pounding, the warmth spread through his entire body, making the cold more bearable.
"Eat well, rest well, and move well, that's how you endure the cold, Brother Squad Leader," Audin said with a smile.
Enkrid nodded. Physical training was a familiar part of his daily life and the physical pain made his brain work faster. A sharp mind led to thoughts about today, making him recall the assassin who came to kill him.
'That skill.'
He couldn't even see how the dagger was thrown. Enkrid was quite confident in his own dagger-throwing skills.
'Not even close.'
An exceptional skill. Nonetheless, it was something he could handle with preparation. First, the pattern was to approach and stab. If that failed, the dagger was thrown.
'Should I say the wall is thin and low?'
The boatman of the Black River said walls kept appearing in front of Enkrid.
'At this level.'
It was easy. That's why he was taking it easy.
"Look, is this hard? This?"
Rem, suddenly in high spirits, jumped out of bed and imitated Enkrid's movements perfectly. Not a single hitch, smooth all the way. His body stretched out straight, showing exceptional flexibility.
"Let's work on our flexibility, okay?"
This guy was annoyingly smug. No, he had always been an annoying bastard.
"Is this hard? This?"
Rem kept teasing, but Enkrid cheerfully ignored him. Watching with eyes half-closed, Ragna, who had been observing both Rem and Enkrid, moved. He was also exceptionally talented in physical activities. It was natural that mastering swordsmanship beyond a certain level required a well-trained body.
Thus, Ragna perfectly replicated the movements. He selected the movements Enkrid had struggled with, like spreading his legs and bending his waist, making him another annoying type.
"Have you developed a hobby for twisting your body?"
Jaxon, who had just returned from an outing, said as he walked in. To him, it looked like a madhouse.
Enkrid, drenched in sweat, was catching his breath. In front of him was a grinning barbarian bent over, touching his toes, and beside him sat a lazybones with his legs spread.
Had everyone gone mad together?
"We're learning a training method to withstand the cold, Brother," Audin explained.
Jaxon, showing no interest, headed to his place. Enkrid got up as it was time to go on duty, and out of pure curiosity, he opened his mouth. The assassin's dagger had a shape he had never seen before.
"Have you ever used a dagger like this? It's for throwing."
"What is it?"
"No."
"No, Brother."
He described the throwing knife without a handle. Rem, Ragna, and Audin spoke, and Big Eyes kept silent as usual, but Jaxon frowned and then relaxed.
"Where did you see it? That?"
"I didn't see it, actually."
He was about to see it now.
"Wasn't there a round notch near the handle?"
Jaxon asked without sitting down, holding his coat in his hand to hang it up.
"Yeah."
There was no need to search his memory. He had just been hit by that blade in today's repeat. A round notch at the end, yes.
"Why do you ask?"
Rem asked as he got back into bed.
"Just heard about it somewhere."
As Jaxon turned away, a blue-eyed black panther emerged from Enkrid's bed. The panther that had snuggled up to him last night was just waking up. It loved the bed and sleep.
Shivering from the cold, it stretched its body front and back. Enkrid stroked the panther's back from head to tail, and Jaxon's voice came.
"Avoid it if you can. It's a Whistling Dagger."
"A Whistling Dagger?"
A name he had never heard before.
"It got its name from the sound it makes when thrown. It's a weapon mainly used for assassination. Difficult to handle, but if you meet someone who can use it properly, well, run."
Jaxon's tone was as cold and kind as ever. Only the content was the problem.
Run away?
Wasn’t it just someone who can throw daggers?
Purr.
The panther purred happily from the stroking. When Big Eyes tried to pet it, the panther bared its fangs viciously.
"Oh, alright. I get it."
It looked like it would bite if he got any closer. At first, Enkrid was worried about the panther harming the squad members, but soon he dismissed that concern. No matter how agile the panther was, it couldn't handle Rem or the other squad members.
Only Big Eyes needed to be careful, but the panther seemed incredibly smart. After living with it for a few days, there were no problems. Enkrid petted the panther's head gently and spoke.
"Don't hate too much. I'll be back from duty."
Enkrid got up.
"Keep doing the bare-handed training. It will help, Brother."
He didn't specify how it would help, but it was obvious soon enough. What Enkrid was always absorbed in.
The sword.
It meant it would help with his swordsmanship.
"Not wrong," Rem nodded. Ragna and Jaxon also nodded.
They all reacted earnestly when it came to Enkrid's matters. It was quite a remarkable thing. These people showed little interest in most things. Enkrid left the barracks for duty.
He thought it was a repetition of the same events and relatively easy, but Jaxon's words made him reconsider. His mind was in turmoil.
'Avoid it? Run away?'
With my current skill?
Even if I fight head-on?
He should have asked that. No, he could find out from now on. The price would be his life and today.
But he would gain something in return. It wouldn't be in vain. Despite having faced death countless times, Enkrid never wasted a single day. Even if there was a day sacrificed out of necessity.
In such situations, he always tried to gain something. That was the instinct given to him by the countless repeated days. That instinct whispered to him. The strange-looking half-elf assassin wouldn't be easy to deal with.
"Hey, look! It's the high-rank soldier, Sorcery Breaker!"
Just like Jack and Bon. They praised Enkrid, lightening the mood. If he hadn't known about it, it would have been different. Knowing their intentions made them clear. Excessive praise to inflate his ego and loosen his guard.
'When I see it like this, they are very meticulous.'
Was it necessary to do this for just a single soldier?
A perfectionist, perhaps?
While recalling the half-elf's face and guessing his personality, he arrived at the market.
"So many people."
Jack quipped from the side. Bon narrowed the gap on the other side.
"Yeah."
I replied as I saw a guy in rags approaching. Suddenly, he spread his arms to the sides.
Smack!
Again, only Jack got hit while Bon dodged. Enkrid twisted his body boldly. His body had stiffened from the cold, but Audin's exercises had helped. His body was less stiff than the first ‘today’.
With no time to draw his sword, he grabbed Bon by the collar, and Bon reflexively swung his fist. Enkrid, with the boldness of the Heart of the Beast, watched the trajectory of the fist until the end and predicted it, tilting his head to dodge.
Tick, and the fist brushed past his earlobe. Then it was Enkrid's time. Gripping the collar, he twisted to choke Bon.
"Grrk!"
A groan escaped.
"Hup."
Taking a short breath, Enkrid swung Bon as a human shield. Even though he was light, the weight of an armed adult male bore down on his arm. He twisted his waist, using centrifugal force to swing Bon around. Half-turning, pulling Bon forward, Enkrid saw the half-elf who had thrown off his rags.
At the moment their eyes met, the elf seemed to sneer.
Why in this situation?
I had just acquired a human shield. He should be panicking. The assassin's plan had been anticipated and reacted to. The half-elf remained calm. With a sneer, he just waved his hand.
As the assassin's dangling hand reached his chest, there was a flash of light. A bolt of lightning. Literally moving at a speed that couldn't be seen, a dagger flew. The speed of the assassin's hand reaching his chest and flicking forward matched the lightning speed of the dagger.
Before he could even block with Bon, the dagger flew and lodged in the vicinity of his heart.
Whistle!
The whistling sound reached his ears belatedly. With a thud, the pain followed, revealing the assassin's action and the event that occurred. He had thrown a dagger, and it had lodged in his heart.
"Damn."
His instincts were right. The opponent wasn't easy. Just from the dagger-throwing skill alone, he was no ordinary person.
What if he prevented him from throwing the daggers?
Though a dagger was lodged in his body, the only thing people around noticed was Enkrid and the two soldiers fighting.
"Let go of me!"
Bon shouted, kicking Enkrid in the stomach. The strength drained from his hand. Enkrid released the collar, hit in the stomach, and a dagger lodged in his heart. If he were fine, that would be stranger. Blood gushed from his mouth.
As he kneeled and braced himself from falling, the half-elf, who had approached, asked.
"You anticipated it, didn't you? Were their acting skills that bad?"
With screams and commotion around, the assassin didn't care. For him, it seemed only he and Enkrid mattered right now.
"...Why?"
Saving his last breath, he asked. Despite the screams and chaos, the assassin clearly heard Enkrid's words.
"Why do you ask? I'm curious. It seemed like you knew and reacted."
Enkrid weakly nodded and, gathering his last strength, spoke.
"The acting was terrible. Even a passing dog would laugh."
The elf nodded and spread his hands left and right.
Thwack.
With a close-range hand gesture, two daggers flew. Enkrid saw the tips of the daggers embedded in Jack and Bon's foreheads. Two round notches, Whistling Daggers.
"Th-That."
"Why, why."
The two couldn't finish their words and fell backward. The half-elf stopped after dealing with them.
Enkrid knew Rot was behind him, but Rot wouldn't jump in such a situation. Apparently Rot was a nickname for Rottin.
He must be hiding somewhere. The half-elf didn't kill Rot. Maybe he would chase him after this was over.
Either way, it wasn't Enkrid's concern.
"A tenacious lover doesn't let go of its prey."
At the assassin's words, Enkrid nodded.
"Right."
"Not surprised?"
"Should I be?"
"Well, usually people are."
Sorry, but it's already the third time. Instead of being surprised, Enkrid grabbed the dagger lodged in his chest and pulled it out.
Plop.
As the dagger, lodged in his heart, was pulled out, extreme pain surged. Blood gushed from the gaping wound. As Enkrid's vision blurred, the assassin spoke.
"Interesting guy."
Yeah? Is that so?
'I'll make it more interesting.'
Enkrid thought as he closed his eyes. With the darkness, the boatman appeared.
"Hehehe."
He silently mocked him. He seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. Though his face and body weren't visible, the boatman's feeling conveyed clearly. The boatman's ridicule was short-lived. After the darkness, a new morning dawned again.
"Good morning."
Enkrid, who had suddenly woken up, grabbed Audin and quickly learned the exercises. Then, as soon as he saw Jaxon, he grabbed his sleeve and dragged him outside.
Jaxon, about to push away the one grabbing his sleeve, stopped when he saw it was the Squad Leader.
"Eh? Where are we going?"
Rem asked from behind.
"Got something to ask."
Equivalent Exchange Jaxon surprisingly knew a lot. General information was Big Eyes' forte, but for more critical information, Jaxon was the go-to. He earned the nickname Equivalent Exchange Jaxon for also being an informant. He gave what the other wanted, but the other had to give what he wanted in return.
"Whistling Dagger, you know it?"
Jaxon frowned.
"Where did you hear about that?"
Observing Jaxon's reaction, Enkrid judged that the Whistling Dagger wasn't an ordinary item.
"Tell me. About Whistling Dagger."
"Is this a deal?"
Now he wasn't the Squad Member but Equivalent Exchange Jaxon.
"Yes."
The price didn't matter. The conversation would disappear when the day repeated. Even if tomorrow came, he could repay it then. However, realizing he couldn't overcome this wall on just the fourth 'today,' he sensed this conversation wouldn't be forgotten.
A wall was a wall. It was not easy to overcome.
The boatman's mocking seemed to transform into words, echoing in his mind.
Chapter 57: Seeing It Made Me Want It
It was a sudden question.
Not that Jaxon ever got flustered. His face remained as stern as ever. Jaxon paused briefly, about to speak but then stopped. He seemed to be contemplating.
Enkrid stood with his arms hanging loosely, quietly waiting for Jaxon to speak. Pressing him wouldn't make it happen any faster. The contemplation was brief.
Soon, Jaxon's breath formed a white puff in the air.
"The Whistling Dagger, once known as the 'Silent Dagger' for its speed, was called that because it was as fast as a mere whisper. It moves so fast it's hard for the human eye to track. That's why it's difficult to counter. Most people die not knowing what hit them. Such is the nature of the Whistling Dagger."
"If you had to face it?"
Was there a way to avoid the assassin?
There didn't seem to be one for now. The assassin had prepared meticulously. He had used spies among the allies and had thoroughly prepared for the kill.
At least, it looked that way to Enkrid. With his limbs bound in chains, he had to be dragged wherever his captor wanted. It was time to find a way out.
"If you must?"
Jaxon tilted his head slightly. It must have sounded like a strange question to him.
"Yes, if I must."
Enkrid emphasized once more. Jaxon looked deeply into Enkrid's eyes. Enkrid did not avoid his gaze. Blue eyes and reddish-brown eyes clashed in the air.
Jaxon's eyes seemed to ask.
'Why do you need this?'
Enkrid ignored it.
Equivalent Exchange Jaxon sold necessary information. He was not someone who asked 'why.' Jaxon's expression hardened as he spoke.
"This information won't come cheap."
"The more expensive, the better."
He meant it. Today's 'today' would not be the last 'today.' When morning came again, the value of the information Jaxon provided would drop significantly. It would become something Enkrid already knew, at least to him.
Jaxon's expression soured, as if troubled. Enkrid ignored even that. What was urgent wasn't Jaxon's feelings.
"You need to see the hand movement before the sound. Everything depends on the hand movement."
Jaxon briefly explained the countermeasure. Don't be fooled by the sound. If you hear it, it's already too late. Focus on the opponent's movements.
"Never lose sight of the opponent, especially if they are a top-tier assassin who knows how to throw invisibly."
The Whistling Dagger's most significant feature was its thin blade.
The blade was sharpened repeatedly to penetrate even the toughest steel breastplates. If the thrower's skill was exceptional, it could indeed pierce steel plates. Jaxon added that skilled throwers sometimes used multiple thin blades layered together.
Jaxon explained two main ways to throw a dagger.
One was to swing the hand widely to increase power. The other was to throw it without showing the throw.
"You've seen me throw a dagger, right?"
Enkrid asked. Dagger throwing was a skill he once intensely trained.
"Yes, it was like throwing a stone."
Jaxon dismissed Enkrid's skill with a single comment. He implied it was better to throw a stone than a dagger. Throwing a stone would at least have some impact, while the dagger wouldn't even hit the target.
'Harsh.'
Even though Enkrid was usually indifferent to such things, Jaxon's words were sharp enough to pierce through his indifference. It didn't feel like a dagger to the heart, but at least it felt like one lodged somewhere in his arm.
"Teach me. Properly."
Enkrid said, a bit irritated.
"Then learn. I'll add it to the list of transactions."
"Hmm?"
"Don't like it?"
He didn't dislike it. For someone like Enkrid, who was always eager to learn, the offer was like an oasis in the desert. Always thirsty, Enkrid quickly nodded.
"No, I like it."
"Start with how to hold it."
With patrol duty approaching, the lesson was brief. At most, half an hour. In that short time, Enkrid saw Jaxon anew.
"Practice is essential for it to be meaningful."
Holding and throwing thin blades, holding and throwing hand axes, holding and throwing heavy daggers. Each had a different grip and throw technique. There was always something to learn.
As he turned to leave for patrol duty, Jaxon spoke. It was a small but powerful voice.
"Don't create situations where you have to face them. That's the first thing."
Though Jaxon had been subtly prickly throughout, his final words were filled with concern. Enkrid wondered what he had given these people.
'Be kind without reason.'
Not a romantic relationship, nor had he shared deep friendships with them, yet. Jaxon, Rem, and Ragna treated him like a child left by the water.
'Or maybe not.'
They never tried to follow him to the battlefield or during other missions, so he wasn't exactly a child left by the water. A pointless thought.
"Sure."
In reality, he had no intention of doing so. You couldn't avoid what you wanted to avoid.
"Are you on duty as a Squad Leader? Now that you're a high-rank soldier? Damn, congrats."
It was Jack. Of course, Bon was with him.
"Let's go."
He once again plunged into the wave of today. The icy air chilled him to the bone, but he wore an extra layer, making it almost like wearing armor. The thick clothes and Audin's exercises helped warm his body.
The cold felt more bearable.
"No way I can give it for that price!"
Always the same scene in today's marketplace. Enkrid used a merchant's shout as his cue. It was around this time.
As the leather merchant's scolding voice rang out, the rag-covered half-elf appeared. Simultaneously, Jack and Bon flanked him.
Enkrid had no intention of wasting any day. He had a plan for today as well.
He tripped Jack with his left foot.
"Ugh."
On his left, Jack fell forward. As soon as Jack fell, Enkrid drew his sword from his right side. It was a sword called a Guard Sword. A broad, thick blade also used as a shield.
Shing, thud.
"Crazy!"
Bon exclaimed in shock. Understandably so. Enkrid had sliced Jack's neck with the broad sword.
"Gurgle."
There was no time for a dying scream. Jack, with his throat cut, collapsed, clutching his neck, blood spilling onto the ground. The sight of fallen Jack made people scream.
"Ahhh!"
"Ugh!"
The surrounding merchants backed away. No one wanted to be accidentally killed. Bon flinched. Enkrid didn't allow him to move. The broad blade moved again from his hand. A downward strike aimed at Bo's collarbone.
Clang!
"You bastard!"
Bo blocked with his own dagger. It was a thin, stabbing weapon. He probably intended to use it to stab Enkrid's side if things went wrong. Enkrid pressed down and pushed, forcing Bon to retreat.
He bought himself time and covered his heart with the broad blade, turning his body. It all happened in just a few breaths. If he hadn't prepared, it was enough time to be stunned and freeze.
'Up to this point.'
The plan had worked. Enkrid's gaze met the assassin's.
The assassin pushed back his hood. His appearance was strangely unpleasant. His eyes showed curiosity and excitement.
And it began again.
'Not the sound, the hand.'
He closed his ears and focused all his senses on his eyes. He predicted the next move based on the visual information. It was a technique Jaxon had taught him.
Thunk!
Enkrid expected the assassin to aim for his heart. If not that, then his head. His focus paid off, and he saw the blade turn into a flash of light.
But he couldn't see where the blade would land.
So, he covered his heart and turned his head. The Whistling Dagger thrown by the assassin struck his right forearm.
A searing pain tore through his forearm, and his fingers lost strength. It was a fatal injury that would be impossible to recover from without divine healing.
"Damn."
A hollow laugh escaped.
An unexpected strike. He had protected his heart, so the assassin aimed for his arm. Instead of breaking through the shield, he targeted the shield-bearer. A different perspective.
'It’s not an amateur assassin.'
The already established fact etched itself into his mind again.
Whistle.
The second whistle sounded, and the dagger pierced his heart. Did this bastard have some grudge against him?
He seemed to only feel satisfied when he drove a dagger into Enkrid's heart.
"Cough."
He coughed up blood. It gushed out, and on his knees, he propped himself up with his left arm. A shadow loomed over his head.
"Interesting guy, the tenacious lover never..."
"Misses its prey."
Enkrid squeezed out his last strength to steal the assassin's words. He looked up at the half-elf, who wore a bewildered expression. His mouth half-opened, he couldn't continue speaking, his lips quivering before uttering a single word like a question.
"You?"
Surprised? You should be.
He was a guy who always moved as if he had everything planned. Enkrid wanted to see his expression break.
He was satisfied.
"See you again."
The assassin wouldn't remember, but Enkrid would remember today's today. He was telling him they would meet again in the next repitition.
The assassin was startled by Enkrid's words.
"A trap?"
The half-elf looked around.
Hiring a top-tier assassin to kill just a single soldier was indeed excessive. It would make sense if it were a trap. The implication that Enkrid might survive this encounter led the assassin to think there was more to it.
Of course, it was all a misunderstanding.
There was no trap.
Enkrid's head slumped forward with a thud. Another day ended.
The boatman appeared again, mocking him with laughter.
‘Does this bastard have nothing better to do?’ Enkrid thought as he faced today once more.
“Ugh, it's freezing.”
Rem's whining voice could be heard from the morning.
"Move around to warm up. It helps a bit."
Enkrid preempted Audin’s advice and got up to stretch. A body warmed up was definitely better than one stiff from the cold. That was certain. In that sense, Audin's exercises were undoubtedly beneficial.
As he stretched, Audin approached and asked.
"Where did you learn that?"
From you, but he couldn’t say that honestly.
“From a passing monk.”
Audin had said the exercises he taught originated from a temple. In other words, it was one of the training methods of monks who used physical combat as part of their discipline.
“You’ve learned it well.”
Audin joined him in stretching.
“When it's cold, the best thing to do is huddle under a blanket. Can't you get some heated leather or something? Now that you're a Squad Leader, you should take care of the squad's cold.”
Rem grumbled, and Enkrid engaged in some light banter with him. Soon, Jaxon returned.
"Let's talk."
Enkrid immediately took Jaxon outside.
"Hey, where are you going without me?"
Rem continued to grumble from behind.
"I want to learn how to handle the Whistling Dagger."
One thing Enkrid had learned from repeating today was that it was better to ask directly for what he needed than to waste time persuading.
"Where did you hear about that?"
“You pick up things here and there. I want to learn.”
“The price?”
“Whatever you want, I’ll even write you a blank check.”
Famous trading companies issued promissory notes, and the most famous story involved the continent's top trading company, Rengadis.
Rengadis' head had a son who joined a monster hunting party out of a sense of adventure. When the family learned of this, they went searching for him, but he was already in danger. The Imperial Knights, passing by, saved him.
In gratitude, the Rengadis family gave the Imperial Knights a blank check, promising to pay any amount within their means. This story became so famous that "blank check" became a common expression, meaning anything short of one’s life.
Jaxon frowned.
"You shouldn't make such promises lightly."
“I want to learn that badly.”
Enkrid meant it. He wanted to have, to learn, the skill of the half-elf assassin's Whistling Dagger. His desire burned. Seeing the fire in Enkrid’s eyes, Jaxon nodded.
In those eyes, he saw a flame that would destroy and consume everything it touched— a flame named desire.
Chapter 58: Once I Had It, I Could See
There was a time when even desire was forbidden. Dreaming and hoping for something, knowing it was unattainable, and living a life of desperation.
Such was Enkrid's life.
But not now. Now he could reveal his desires and pursue them. No, it was even advantageous to do so now. After warming up with exercises, Enkrid had a brief session with Jaxon to learn how to throw a dagger.
"I want to learn more."
"You seemed like a beginner."
Jaxon muttered after watching Enkrid throw the dagger. Enkrid replied nonchalantly.
"There was a guy on the battlefield who threw like this. I watched and learned."
Jaxon looked at Enkrid with a blank expression.
"Believe me, it's true."
"Is that so?"
Of course.
Geniuses are like that, aren’t they?
Living as a dullard, he had seen countless acts by those called geniuses or those with talent. Now he was pretending to be one of them. It was something he could do because he was repeating today. Revealing his desires was advantageous because it required maintaining such an attitude.
What are geniuses like?
Knowing what they see in front of them must be seized and they don't hesitate to express their desires. Above all, he truly meant it. When it came to the desire to learn, Enkrid was the best on the continent.
"Very well."
As always, the hesitation was brief, and seriousness followed. Jaxon taught properly. It was quite an enjoyable time. Enkrid repeatedly practiced holding and throwing the dagger.
In a short time, he was drenched in sweat.
"Aren't you supposed to go on duty?"
"It's fine."
It was just enough to warm up his body, not exhaust it. Another day began anew. Or more precisely, it was the seventh today. Instead of walking with Jack and Bon on either side, Enkrid walked on the far left.
"It's a superstition, I feel better walking on the far left."
There was no arguing when Enkrid insisted. Jack and Bon had no choice.
"Really? That's peculiar."
"Alright, walk where you feel comfortable."
Though the sweat quickly cooled, the heat warming his body remained. Even though it was the seventh repetition of today, the air felt subtly different. The sunlight pierced the cold wind, touching his skin. The chirping of winter birds brushed his ears.
The feel of the soil underfoot and the vibrations with each step were pleasant. The air, the ground, the soil, the wind. All of it wrapped around, touched, warmed, stayed, and flowed. The sky was clear too. The biting cold of winter, the fourth season, announced the year's end with its icy winds. But even that wind brought a sense of freshness rather than just cold.
In the repetition of today, he had always endured with intensity. But somehow, this repetition felt a bit easier. A sense of peace wrapped around him. Not that he had forgotten the intensity. It was just comfortable. This path, this moment, everything.
'I wonder why I feel at peace.'
He didn’t know. He knew he would die soon. The pain— the moment of death he would have to fight against was approaching. No matter how many times he died, it never became familiar.
"The throw happens in a moment. Before that, you must relax your entire body. Let your body go limp and focus in a state of calm. It will be difficult."
Jaxon’s advice was half right. It was difficult, but not impossible. It was hard, but doable. Boldness which was granted by the Heart of the Beast made him watch everything until the end even with death in front of him. Focus Point made him perceive the same situation differently than ever before.
Thus, the combination of boldness and concentration allowed Enkrid to grasp the edge of talent.
Normally, he wouldn't have obtained either boldness or concentration, but Enkrid now had two threads.
'It works.'
With just a few teachings and three or four repetitions of practice, it became second nature. Luck played a huge role.
Normally, it would have taken countless repetitions to grasp it, but it was within his reach. That thin thread was immense joy for Enkrid. An unprecedented exhilaration.
"Are you okay?"
Bon asked from beside him. Walking with a blank expression, then grinning, he couldn’t have looked entirely normal. It was a relief he wasn’t drooling.
"Oh, um, I'm fine. Sorry for the unsightly display."
Enkrid walked while wiping his mouth. Watching his lively steps, Jack and Bon exchanged glances. Jack signaled with his eyes.
'That guy seems a bit crazy, right?'
'I think so too.'
They conversed with just their eyes and gestures. It was a familiar routine. It was a signal used since their days in the Thieves’ Guild.
"The weather is nice."
Enkrid said.
"It's freezing."
Jack pouted. They were supposed to lull their target into a false sense of security, but the target was already too relaxed, making them rebellious.
What was with this guy?
"Of course, it's cold. It's the last season of the year."
Winter was harsh, but one shouldn’t miss the warmth amid the harshness and cold. Relaxing the body wasn’t something that could be done by merely thinking about it. Jaxon’s demonstration came to mind. Overlaid with the image of the half-elf assassin.
To relax the body, mental relaxation must come first. Mental burdens, threats, and anxieties. Enkrid threw them all away.
In a relaxed mind, he repeatedly recalled the half-elf assassin throwing the Whistling Dagger. It was much like the repetition of today.
What does one learn from defeat?
What did he learn from the countless situations where he threw away his life?
The stage of needing to throw away his life to gain something had passed.
Countless questions repeated in his mind. Thanks to his relaxed body and mind, his steps felt wobbly. He walked, but there was no strictness required for patrol duty. Walking like that, he soon reached the market.
"Squad Leader, what's making you so happy?"
Jack asked, stopping his steps. He wasn't really curious. He asked while subtly shifting his body. Bo also moved. Both were positioning themselves to strike. They subtly blocked the surrounding view, ready to draw their weapons and stab Enkrid at any moment.
Enkrid kept them in his sight and took a deep breath. Then he stepped forward. He tapped Jack’s shin with his toe. He thought he was relaxed, but his body moved more smoothly than ever before. A kick timed so perfectly the opponent couldn't react.
Whack.
"Ugh!"
Jack bent forward, clutching his shin. Enkrid lightly, really lightly, moved his left hand to press down on Jack’s head and raised his knee.
Thud!
The sound of dough being pounded echoed. Jack's head lifted again, showing a face smeared with blood from a broken nose.
"No way, I can't sell it for that price!"
It was a moment faster than usual. It was an unexpected move, different from today's plan. Unintentional, just following his body's lead.
'Doesn't matter.'
Enkrid didn’t care. It felt like he had taken a drug that made him lightheaded and euphoric. Even if he had actually taken a drug, it wouldn't have mattered. His body felt that light.
"What the!"
Bon looked startled. Enkrid's hand was already reaching for Bon's neck.
"Tch!"
Bon pulled back his neck in surprise. It was expected. When moving with the element of surprise, Bon always reacted in one pattern. He had seen that pattern over five times. He was familiar with it.
Instead of his outstretched left hand, Enkrid planted his left foot and twisted his body. Pivoting on his left foot, he turned. Not facing forward but to the side, extending his right hand.
In an instant, his reach lengthened, and his right hand touched Bon’s face. It didn’t end there.
Bang!
The sound of his punch hitting like a drum echoed. Enkrid's fist, fueled by strength, speed, and concentration, shattered Bon's face.
"Argh!"
Bon staggered back three or four steps, clutching his face.
Watching that, Enkrid smoothly turned his body. Maybe it was because he started a bit early, he didn't know.
Even in the repetition of today, things didn’t always happen the same way. Everything could change. Enkrid knew this well.
In the direction he looked, he saw the half-elf. Without even taking off his rags, the elf's hand moved. From below to above. A flash followed his right hand. It was a moment when he hadn't prepared a defense.
But.
'It doesn’t matter.'
Time slowed down for a moment. It was Enkrid’s second experience. A moment when concentration broke through limits. A crack in time experienced by those who reached the realm of geniuses.
In the last battle with Azpen, when he dodged the mustached soldier’s strike, he had a similar sense. It was the same now.
Of course, Enkrid wasn’t aware of it. His mind was still half enchanted. An enchanted mind, burning concentration, blade-like senses, and the boldness of a beast.
He saw the flash. He predicted its destination.
'Can I dodge?'
No. There was no time. The gap in time closed. Enkrid's brain, spinning rapidly, came to a conclusion.
Thunk! Whistle!
He blocked with his arm. The blade lodged in his left forearm, protecting his heart. He heard the noise of the Whistling Dagger, followed by pain in his forearm. A heavy impact and burning pain from the blade.
The pain felt distant. The surrounding commotion faded. Once he had it, he could see. Enkrid could see the Whistling Dagger's trajectory.
He blocked it.
Looking up, he saw the half-elf assassin. The elf, having discarded his rags, was moving his hands continuously. Like a living crossbow.
No, even fiercer.
He couldn’t dodge the first one. But this time, he could. He saw the starting point of the hand and predicted the end of the flash.
Whiiiiiiish!
He perfectly dodged two and one grazed his cheek. The three whistles combined to make a strange harmony. Enkrid pulled the dagger from his forearm.
Blood flowed, but it wasn't enough to incapacitate him. He blocked the point the assassin aimed for, hitting the spot he chose. His arm bore a scar, but he could still move. The leather armor on his forearm had done its job.
"You bastard."
The half-elf, visibly angry, closed the distance. While closing in, he kept throwing flashes from somewhere in his body. He couldn’t dodge them all.
No, he could have held on longer, but today was different. Rottin had approached from behind. Enkrid hadn’t noticed.
Rottin pushed Enkrid’s back.
Thud.
That was it. Three daggers lodged in his heart, side, and neck, releasing noise. Horrific pain surged.
Enkrid’s body slowly collapsed. Summoning all his strength, he knelt on one knee, something hot surged from his throat. Unable to hold it back, he opened his mouth and blood foam spilled out.
Aaaah!
Only then did the surrounding screams reach his ears. His hazy mind returned to its original state. The pain became vivid. The half-elf assassin approached the fallen Enkrid.
His expression was not pleasant.
"You."
He spat out a word but said no more.
A tenacious lover never misses its prey.
It was his turn to say those words. But he didn’t. Or rather, he couldn’t. The assassin’s eyes turned to Enkrid’s face.
"You bastard."
He glared, like a toad full of venom. Enkrid was laughing.
"Hehehe."
Even as he coughed up blood, he laughed. There had to be a misunderstanding. The elf felt mocked, but Enkrid had no such intention.
Dying, he thought.
'Only seven times.'
He had repeated today seven times. But it wasn’t just a breakthrough; he saw beyond it.
Only seven times.
No, it couldn’t be called only.
He ran looking only at tomorrow, knowing no despair or frustration, making it possible.
A mediocre talent makes a human with endless effort. Endless effort lets a man grasp the edge of talent.
It was a miracle. No, there were no miracles. This was a reward gained by never giving in to despair or frustration in any repeated day.
Tomorrow, he would rise again. Enkrid believed he could end this.
"Crazy bastard."
Thud!
The elf once again pierced Enkrid’s neck with a long blade. That was it. The final moment of life. Death approached, and darkness enveloped the world. Beyond the darkness, the boatman on the river appeared.
Hehe!
He mocked Enkrid again. Enkrid was curious about their next meeting. How that mocking laugh would change.
"Good morning."
Another morning. Enkrid got up lightly.
He couldn’t say it was perfect, but he learned how to throw the Whistling Dagger. And though it wasn’t perfect, he learned the basic exercises of monks from Audin.
"It’s freezing, what’s so good?"
"Had a good dream."
A very, very good dream. A day spent in a daze. That day, that today. Enkrid had glimpsed the life of the talented. He was immensely satisfied. At the same time, he saw the path forward.
The path— the way to overcome the wall before him.
Chapter 59: Sword Flicking Technique
Enkrid was hit in the side by a bolt on the eighth repetition. The bolt pierced through his ribs and tore into his organs.
‘This was unexpected.’
He had dodged all the Whistling Daggers and kicked away Rottin, who attacked from behind. In that brief moment, a bolt had suddenly flown towards him. There was no way to avoid it.
‘They really were thorough.’
It seemed like removing the bolt would cause even more fatal damage. When he raised his head, the hideous face of a half-elf was before him.
Were all half-bloods this ugly?
He didn’t know.
It was the first time he had ever met a half-elf in his life. He knew that most of them didn’t receive good treatment.
“You’re quite perceptive, you.”
The half-elf said from above him. This one sure loved to talk.
“I suppose so. Hoo.”
Enkrid spoke as he caught his breath. He took note of the half-elf's position and distance, preparing for his final desperate act.
Ting.
In an instant, he drew a broad-bladed dagger and thrust it upwards. The guard sword barely grazed the elf's cheek. The elf dodged by tilting his head to the side and kicked Enkrid in the stomach.
Thud.
“Guh.”
A groan escaped instead of a scream. The arrowhead embedded in his intestines twisted inside him. It hurt like hell. It had already been painful to move, but getting hit made the excruciating pain turn his vision white.
“Where do you think you're going?”
He didn’t need much more time to die. The elf’s hand was clean and sharp. Enkrid closed his eyes as his throat was cut.
In the next regression of today, the elf, Rottin, Jack, and Bon attacked all at once. Even as he died, Enkrid managed to kill Jack and Bon, and took one of the half-elf’s arms. The final blow once again struck his heart.
The elf had hidden an awl-like sword in his waist and stabbed Enkrid’s heart. Thus, he spent nine iterations of today, and the tenth morning dawned.
After finishing exercises with Audin, he met with Jaxon. It was a repetitive day. Enkrid gave his all each day, knowing he couldn’t waste any.
“Could you check my stance?”
Equivalent exchange or not, Enkrid showed Jaxon how to throw a dagger to get him off his back. His proficiency was entirely different from when he first learned it. It was a skill honed to the limit of his talent.
Indeed, it was different from before.
Enkrid activated Focus Point, relaxed his body, and then used his entire body’s muscles as if they were springs in an instant. His hand sliced through the air, and the dagger in his hand flew off with a sharp sound. It couldn’t be called as fast as light, but it was several times quicker than before.
“The arm and hand act as the launcher, using the elasticity of the whole body. Up to this point, you understand well. Do you see anything lacking?”
Gape.
It was the first time Enkrid had ever seen Jaxon open his mouth so wide.
Wasn’t he usually a calm squad member with an indifferent look and tone?
He was a friend who showed little emotional change or expression. The shocked expression on his face quickly disappeared. His eyes still wavered, but his expression returned to normal. Even the open mouth lasted barely a second.
“Jaxon?”
“Where did you learn that?”
“There was a guy on the battlefield who threw daggers exceptionally well.”
“Threw them?”
“I learned by watching.”
“Learned by watching?”
He sounded like a parrot repeating the words back. It was understandable. This type of skill couldn’t be acquired just by training. It was different from honing basic skills. Without inherent sense, learning this skill itself was nonsense.
Jaxon knew that well. That’s why he was surprised.
But the squad leader?
Although his skills had recently improved, this was of a different kind. Enkrid, who was nodding, was staring at him intently, waiting for him to speak.
“That’s enough. It’s not a technique worth delving into deeply. However, what you’re holding now has some weight, so it’s better to add heaviness to your fingertips rather than lightness.”
Jaxon chose and spoke the necessary words. Enkrid nodded.
“It’s called the Sword Flicking Technique.”
Then Jaxon spoke abruptly.
Though not an equivalent exchange, Jaxon was not the type to withhold teaching. Enkrid corrected his stance. It was a habit deeply ingrained in him, a posture learned and expressed by observing Crang.
There was even a way to do one’s best at listening. Seeing this posture made Jaxon think it was enjoyable.
Who would listen so seriously to mere throwing techniques?
If he hadn’t shown such an attitude, Jaxon would have ignored and dismissed the squad leader long ago.
“A long time ago, a legendary assassin named Geor established the basics of this technique. There's a theory that he was inspired by the five sword techniques compiled by Leonessis Oniac, but the details are unclear.”
It was a technique with history. Enkrid’s focus burned even more intensely. Jaxon explained and simultaneously showed the way forward. Listening intently, Enkrid’s eyes shone with seriousness.
Though it was called the Sword Flicking Technique, it wasn’t just a technique for throwing swords. It encompassed handling all throwing weapons. In the midst of this, the topic of Whistling Daggers came up unprompted.
“There are throwing daggers called Whistling Daggers. If you encounter them, avoid them. They’re difficult to deal with. The reason the word ‘sword’ is in the Sword Flicking Technique is because of the Whistling Daggers.”
Additional explanations followed.
Whistling Daggers were originally made by layering thin blades. Geor pursued the ideal of using just one layer, one single dagger. Once only one blade was thrown, it wouldn’t even make a sound, hence it wouldn’t be called a Whistling Dagger anymore.
‘How many layers were there?’
Enkrid instinctively recalled the Whistling Dagger the half-elf had thrown. He remembered it when it was stuck in his arm. The dagger in his arm had three layers.
“Hey, isn’t it your shift today?”
Bon came to the front of the quarters and called for Enkrid. He was so engrossed that he didn’t realize the shift time had approached.
“Ah, I forgot. Let’s go. It’s the same shift today, right?”
“Yes, it’s Bon.”
“I know. From the recon squad.”
Enkrid responded casually to Bon and then spoke to Jaxon.
“Learned well.”
“Did you?”
Jaxon never thought of himself as talkative, but he had to admit he spoke more than usual in front of the squad leader. Though he only spoke what was necessary, he did speak a lot.
‘Did I go too far with the Whistling Daggers?’
Why did that topic come up?
Upon reflection, it made sense. It was a topic bound to come up.
Because of the posture Enkrid showed.
‘The throwing technique resembles it.’
Although Geor’s Sword Flicking Technique didn’t have a set way of throwing, there was a basic framework. The posture the squad leader showed earlier reminded him exactly of the Whistling Daggers. It was as if someone had taught him directly.
Jaxon couldn’t possibly know, but the one who corrected Enkrid’s posture was him.
“Let’s go this way.”
Enkrid arbitrarily changed the patrol route.
“Huh? The orders were to patrol the market. Damn, we’ll get disciplined for this.”
Jack protested.
“I’ll take responsibility.”
He was the squad leader, a high-rank soldier, and a talent desired by both the 1st Company and the Frontier Slaughterers. A late-blooming new talent, who only started receiving attention at the age of thirty.
That was Enkrid.
There was nothing the two recon squad soldiers could do against him.
“I said I’ll take responsibility. We should patrol at a leisurely pace too. Let’s go.”
Enkrid took the lead. The two naturally followed.
“Leaving the patrol route is a disciplinary offense.”
Bon muttered, looking at Jack. Jack's hands moved quickly.
‘What do we do?’
‘I don’t know.’
Bon shook his head. Even without looking, Enkrid could hear the two conversing. Discussing wouldn’t lead to any answers. Some things in the world were inevitable. Like when a superior ordered you to do something, you do it.
And right now, he was the superior and senior.
The assassin had prepared the place, time, and people.
Was it necessary to comply?
‘Change the location.’
The opponent was an assassin; there was no need to enter the stage he prepared. That was the answer Enkrid came up with after pondering. He moved arbitrarily. He walked around the outskirts of the castle gates, avoiding the urban areas.
Jack and Bon were troubled. They tried persuading him to head to the market, but Enkrid remained steadfast.
After walking for about half an hour. Enkrid suddenly stopped.
“Huh? Why did you stop?”
The two, who had walked past Enkrid, stopped two steps ahead and turned around. They had given up on entering the market. After giving up, they had secretly left signals everywhere.
So now, the time had come.
Enkrid, who had been looking at them blankly, asked.
“Why did you do it?”
Blinking blankly Jack and Bon looked at Enkrid and then at each other.
What the hell is he talking about?
I have no idea.
“Yes?”
Bon asked on their behalf.
“I asked why you did it.”
“What the hell are you talking about? Speak clearly so we can understand, damn it.”
Jack responded gruffly.
“When you stepped back and placed your hands on your swords, didn’t you think that was a pathetic excuse?”
At Enkrid’s words, the two exchanged glances again. Then.
Shing!
Both drew their swords. Bon had a stiletto-shaped dagger with a thin blade. Jack had a relatively thick shortsword.
Enkrid stood still.
“Damn, you’re really perceptive.”
“You’ll have to die here.”
Though the plan had been disrupted, their task was clear. Jack and Bon exchanged glances and nodded. While they hesitated, Enkrid drew his sword as well.
Shing!
The longsword, its blade sharpened, gleamed as it reflected the sunlight. He took a big step forward and swung the sword in a wide arc. As he swung it widely, Jack and Bon read the distance and evaded.
But they didn’t stop there.
Since Enkrid had swung his sword widely, there were many openings. Bon took advantage of one and lunged forward. He was a soldier with exceptional physical skills. Putting strength into his back leg, he charged forward. Enkrid had just grabbed the sword with both hands and was shifting his weight to the right.
When Bon got within range of his shortsword.
Thunk!
A blade suddenly protruded from Enkrid's left armpit. That blade pierced through Bon’s neck.
Vallen Style Swordsmanship, Shadow Stab.
It began with pretending to swing wide to draw the enemy in. Then, supporting the longsword with his left hand, he concealed his right hand with his body, drew a dagger from his right waist, and thrust it through the armpit.
The opponent would never have expected a blade to come from there. Bon had relied too much on his agility and closed the distance too quickly. Enkrid had predicted Bon’s reaction.
A guy who prided himself on agility wouldn’t miss an opportunity to close the distance. Just because he had adopted the Northern Heavy Sword style as his base didn’t mean he had to forget what he had learned before. It was a realization from his last battle with the mustached soldier on the battlefield with Azpen.
Basics are just basics; adding or subtracting from them is up to the user. Swinging a heavy sword softly and flowing, or aiming for a counterattack was all possible. Thus, mixing in Vallen Style Swordsmanship was also permissible. As long as the foundational frame didn’t waver, it was fine.
Gurgling, Bon collapsed to the ground. Blood poured from the pierced neck, soaking the ground.
“...Damn, that’s filthy.”
Seeing this, Jack’s face turned pale.
He had no confidence to escape, nor to fight.
What could he do?
“Why did you do it?”
“Why would you care, damn it?”
Jack remained consistent, and since Enkrid didn’t prepare a blade of mercy for his opponent, their fight was brief. A short, downward strike with the longsword. Jack dodged rather than blocked. Predicting his move, Enkrid, who swung as if to cut short, swung horizontally.
Slash! Tear!
The well-sharpened blade created a hole in Jack’s side where it shouldn’t have been.
“Huuk, damn it.”
Those were Jack’s last words. Instead of a death cry, he collapsed with a curse. Enkrid paused for a moment at the scene. He planted his sword in the ground and took a long breath.
Only then did others arrive.
Ping—
A bolt flew from behind. Enkrid dodged it with a tilt of his head and saw one masked guy, Rottin hesitating nearby, and an assassin in rags.
Enkrid asked while still holding his sword in the ground.
“You’re all coming at once, right?”
A one-on-one fight wasn’t going to work. It was as he thought. The guy with the bolt aimed at him again. Enkrid took a short breath.
He relaxed his entire body. Leaving the sword planted in the ground, he dropped his arms. His hanging hand swung like a pendulum. Then, his right hand whipped upwards, flinging the dagger he had been holding.
Swoosh!
Using the elasticity of his whole body, he executed the Sword Flicking Technique. The flying blade embedded itself in the forehead of the masked crossbowman. It was indeed as fast as light.
Seeing this, the half-elf’s shoulders briefly flinched.
“Interesting.”
He muttered soon after.
It was exactly what Enkrid wanted to say.
Chapter 60: Only Ten Times
"Interesting?"
That was exactly what he wanted to say.
"You’re really interesting."
The half-elf, draped in rags, licked his lips and let his arms dangle. His pale hands were visible outside the rags. It was clear just by looking. He was in a ready stance. Once his hands moved, the dreadful whistling sound would follow.
"When dealing with projectiles, it’s too late to react by watching the projectile itself. Watch the hand instead."
This was Jaxon's method for countering Whistling Daggers and facing those who handled throwing weapons. Catching a flying arrow with your eyes was difficult.
"It’s challenging unless you're truly a knight. But even if you're not a knight, there’s a way to dodge incoming arrows."
It was called having an eye for discerning.
Even if the hand is cleverly hidden, the moving arm cannot be fully concealed, keep your eyes on the enemy. Watch their hands and arms. Then see the whole body and dodge.
That was the key.
Jaxon’s tone was gentle, but his words were clear and precise. Rem’s teaching style was fundamentally physical. He preferred showing rather than telling. Jaxon was the opposite. He gave a detailed explanation first, then demonstrated. Understanding with the mind came first for him.
Ragna’s style varied. He gave a brief overview when he wasn't interested, but once intrigued, he combined physical demonstrations and explanations. He went with the flow. Audin was similar to Rem but always spoke with unyielding positivity. Perhaps that made him the worst.
"You can do it, brother."
"It’s fine, brother. That’s not enough to reach God’s embrace."
"Does it hurt? That’s good."
Learning exercises from him was far from easy. Yet, Enkrid benefited greatly from it. They were outside the city, in the shade created by the city walls. The air was several times colder than where the sunlight reached. Even so, his body retained a moderate warmth. There was no sense of stiffening. It was thanks to the exercises he learned from Audin.
Despite his wandering thoughts, Enkrid’s eyes never left the half-elf. The way to dodge Whistling Daggers was to watch the fingertips. Hands were faster than eyes, but one couldn’t hide the swinging arm. You had to see and sense the trajectory.
If you could see it, you could dodge it. He had done it many times. Not taking his eyes off, that was Enkrid’s task now. Enkrid also let his arms dangle.
The half-elf was in the same situation. Although not at the level of Whistling Daggers, his opponent’s throwing skills were formidable.
‘How can I land a blow?’
The half-elf was excited. Originally, it was a boring and tedious task. He had been commissioned to kill an ordinary soldier. There was no excitement in it. The half-elf had two peculiar habits as an assassin.
One was exploiting the enemy’s carelessness to stab their heart. The other was killing a top-notch warrior head-on. Both were his preferences. He initially focused on the former, thinking he couldn’t be satisfied otherwise.
‘This should be fun.’
Now, he leaned towards the latter. The half-elf kept licking his lips. It was a habit when he was concentrating. He continued searching for his opponent's weakness with his eyes. It wasn’t easy to spot. He had a clear sense in his mind. No matter how he threw his Whistling Daggers, his opponent would dodge them now.
Still, it didn’t matter.
‘He’s prepared for the daggers.’
Somehow, his opponent had seen through his plan. And with the simplest means. Changing the location had done it. The plan had gone awry. Three people had died, and there had been a commotion, but no one was coming.
The originally chosen assassination site was the bustling market. The crowd would dull momentary perception. Jack and Bon, meant to be used as disposable pawns, would stir up some trouble with petty talk.
That wasn’t the end. He had brought a skilled crossbowman and hidden him on the roof. Rottin had been ordered to follow secretly. All this preparation was undone by the change of location.
There were no buildings to hide in nearby. Before the fight even started, two fools had died. As soon as they met, an unexpected dagger throw had killed the crossbowman.
‘Did he calculate all this?’
He licked his lips again. His concentration was at its peak, making his lips dry repeatedly. The half-elf tried to deduce his target’s actions up to this point.
‘He calculated it all.’
Somehow, he knew beforehand.
‘The information leaked.’
It didn’t matter where it leaked. The result was all that mattered. After killing Jack and Bon, he immediately dealt with the crossbowman.
‘Clean.’
The opponent had calculated everything, even using the Sword Flicking Technique. After confirming everything, his conclusion was clear.
‘He’s in the same business.’
Either someone in a similar line of work, or someone with extensive experience in such matters. It was a misconception.
But it was understandable.
His opponent had read through the assassination methods and countered them head-on. No matter how the information leaked, such a reaction suggested experience in this field.
