After a tragic accident that claimed the lives of his parents and little sister, Leo, just 17 years old, found himself shouldering all responsibilities alone. By some miracle, he survived the past four months on his own—attending high school, juggling multiple part-time jobs, and enduring sympathetic gazes that pained him. The only respite he found was in books, which offered him an escape and some semblance of joy. One day, while engrossed in the book 'Path of Heroes: Battle Against the End,' his life took an unexpected turn. Halfway through the story, he inexplicably found himself transmigrated into the world of Path of Heroes, inhabiting the body of Azriel Crimson—a character never mentioned in the story's first half. An extra. Someone seemingly irrelevant to the plot. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—fate had other plans, and Leo soon discovered that being a mere extra was not his destiny after all. -------------------------------------- Character illustrations will be available on Discord.

Chapter 1: Prologue
A boy, no older than sixteen, with tousled brown hair and piercing green eyes shadowed by dark circles, sat cross-legged on the cold, concrete floor in front of three tombstones within the confines of an graveyard.

His features were not strikingly handsome, but there was an undeniable charm that set him apart from the average boy.

The warm, golden sunlight caressed his skin, offering a comforting contrast to the hard surface beneath him.

The serene melody of birds chirping filled the air, adding a sense of peace.

A bouquet of flowers was placed in front of each tombstone.

---------------------

Jeanne Karumi

Best mother, perfect daughter, and a kind human

---------------------

Ronald Karumi

Best father, troublesome son, and a kind human

---------------------

Lia Karumi

Perfect daughter and cutest little sister

---------------------

Leo smiled softly as he read what was written on the tombstones in front of him.

The tombstones had a simple design as he didn't have the money nor any other relatives who could help out.

His grandparents had unfortunately passed away last year.

Every day, he came here after school to spend some time with his only family...

If only that driver wasn't drunk.

If only he had persuaded them to stay home with him instead of going to a restaurant.

Perhaps if he went with them, the outcome would have been different...

Shaking his thoughts away, he stood up, being done telling them how his day went.

"...I will see you guys tomorrow again," Leo said as he started to walk away, ignoring the annoying sympathetic gazes directed towards him from other visitors.

Seeing a young teenage boy visiting the graveyard can lead to a lot of speculation after all.

"I am too tired today for work... I will just call in sick later today," Leo muttered to himself, not in the mood to work.

He was sure it would be fine since he never took a break, and the manager of the supermarket he worked for was a kind old man who felt sorry for him.

Opening his phone, he contacted his friend Nathan.

Leo: Skipping work today. Want to hang out?

Nathan: Sorry, got a basketball match today!

Nathan: Let's hang out tomorrow after school.

Leo: Sure, no worries. Good luck with your match.

Nathan: Thanks!

A sigh left his lips as he closed his phone.

"Well, I guess I can just read today instead," he said to himself, starting to walk towards his home.

It only took 20 minutes for him to walk home since it was close to the graveyard.

The apartment he lived in was quite decent in size and price, bought by his parents, where he lived with them.

"I am home..."

He said, opening the door and entering his home.

He had become used to hearing no response whenever he came back.

'Some habits never change, I guess...'

As he thought this, he closed the door and removed his shoes before going to sit on the couch.

A book was placed there that he had been reading before he had to leave for school earlier that morning.

"Great, I had to stop at the most exciting part this morning," Leo said as he picked up the book titled Path of Heroes: Battle Against the End on the front cover, showing a single boy holding a sword with both hands.

******

"Haa..."

Breathing out loud, he closed the book after reading for the past three hours.

The sun was already starting to set.

Standing up, he went to get a glass of water.

"Really, to think someone like him would die when the story is barely halfway done."

It had been a while since he had read something so fun and exciting.

It felt like he was actually part of the story and living the protagonist's life.

Though if he had a single complaint, it was that the protagonist had a harem.

He wasn't a big fan of harems, but other than that, everything was just perfect.

He couldn't wait to read the rest of the story as he hurriedly filled his glass with water.

But the moment he was about to take a sip, the glass fell from his hand, shattering on the ground with water spilling as well.

"Argh! Shit, what the hell!"

Leo held his head as he suddenly felt extremely lightheaded.

His eyes became blurry, making it difficult to see.

"What is happening, damn it? Am I dying?"

Gripping the counter tightly, he tried to stabilize himself.

"Haa...haa..."

His breathing became short and labored.

'Am I getting a heart attack? At this age!?'

Gripping his chest as he felt his heart thumping loudly, he tried to walk towards the couch where his phone was.

'I need to call an ambulance!'

The moment he tried to take another step forward, the book he left on the couch started to emit a blinding light throughout the entire apartment.

He had to tightly close his eyes as the light was blinding him, forcing him to use his hand to cover his eyes.

"What is happening now! Am I becoming delusional as well!?"

Trying to calm himself down from all the things happening, he tried to walk to the couch again.

Yet,

The moment he stepped forward again, his foot slipped because of the water on the ground, making him fall on the broken shards.

"Argh!"

He cried out in pain as he felt broken glass pieces digging into his back.

He felt the energy leaving his body, making it extremely difficult to stand up again.

Leo couldn't see the blinding light anymore; instead, all he saw was darkness with stars surrounding him everywhere.

'I must have hit my head hard...'

He could breathe easier again, and his heart had calmed down, but now his entire body was in pain.

He groaned as he did his best to push himself back up instead of laying on the ground.

His body was aching so much, yet he endured and finally managed to stand up again.

Feeling the wind caressing his cheeks and the rustling sound of leaves, he calmed down a little.

'I am not dead yet...'

'Wait...'

Finding it strange to hear the sound of wind and leaves, he opened his eyes, which had been closed the entire time.

When he finally opened them, instead of finding himself back in his apartment, he was on an old, broken street.

Looking around, he saw broken buildings, some tilting sideways, others only half-standing.

Debris was scattered everywhere, remnants of the old houses and buildings.

Tree branches and other plants covered many of the buildings, intertwining with the ruins.

It felt no different than being inside an abandoned city that hadn't been lived in for ages.

"Huh?"

Chapter 2: Azriel Crimson
"...Where am I?" Leo asked himself as he looked around.

Just a few seconds ago, he was inside his apartment, and now he found himself in some abandoned city.

"Is this some kind of prank, perhaps?" he wondered.

Maybe he had become one of those poor victims of pranksters on social media.

"But everything looks and feels so real, though, so it's not that..."

The pain surrounding his body was only intensifying, becoming more and more unbearable with every second.

"Damn it, just what is wrong with me!"

He was getting frustrated with everything, but when he checked himself, he noticed something odd.

"Did I get taller?"

His body ached yet felt weird as well. He couldn't feel any blood on his back but instead noticed something else.

"Muscles? I don't remember working out..."

He was never a fan of going to the gym or doing any sort of sport.

The only real workout he did was after his family died, and he was forced to work almost seven hours a day.

As he thought, he caught his own reflection in an old abandoned and broken car in the middle of the empty street.

When he saw himself reflected in the broken mirror, he froze.

His reflection was that of a young boy with jet-black onyx hair, so dark it seemed to absorb all light that touched it, cascading over his shoulders in unruly waves.

His eyes were a striking shade of crimson, reminiscent of rubies glinting in the sun, captivating and intense.

His complexion was as pale as moonlight on freshly fallen snow, contrasting sharply with his dark hair and vivid eyes.

His features were finely sculpted—a straight nose, high cheekbones.

In short, he possessed an extraordinary handsomeness that bordered on mesmerizing—a quality that could effortlessly draw the gaze of anyone who crossed his path.

And by anyone, it meant anyone.

Leo felt like he was staring at the window for years before finally snapping out of his thoughts as he stumbled on his own feet and fell back.

"W-what the hell! How is that me!?"

He definitely knew that the person reflected wasn't him in the slightest.

He had brown hair and green eyes!

He definitely wasn't that handsome, as much as it pained him to admit it.

"Just what the hell is going on!?"

As he was starting to panic, his heartbeat was thumping loud against his chest again.

He didn't have time to calm down as suddenly a piercing sensation entered his head.

"A-ARGH!"

He cried out, rolling on the ground as it felt like a knife was stabbed into his brain and kept getting twisted.

The pain was unbearable as suddenly memories started flooding his mind.

Memories that weren't his.

A mature and beautiful woman with blonde hair and red eyes hugged a young boy that looked like her gently after the boy had a nightmare.

The young boy sparred on an open grass field with someone that looked like a younger version of the woman, but unlike her, the young girl had black hair like the boy and red eyes like the mother.

A handsome man with black hair and eyes taught him gently how to use the sword; no matter how many mistakes he made, the man would always be patient with him.

All kinds of memories kept flooding inside his mind, merging with his.

His heart felt warm from them.

Feelings that weren't his own started to become his.

People he didn't know started to become known.

Experiences he didn't have started to become his own.

The last of the memories and feelings that flooded his mind were... painful.

The handsome man and the boy, a little older now, visited the border of the European and Asian continents.

But when they arrived, multiple phase 3 void rifts appeared, sending everyone into chaos.

Humans were getting swarmed as the father of the boy was forced to fend off the void creatures with the help of the army stationed there.

The people there started to flee as they were getting killed and eaten alive.

The boy, though, never left as he watched everything unfold before him.

The last of his memories was that of the boy's father annihilating the creatures, covered in their blood with a crazy smile on his face, before everything went black.

After a while, the pain in his head finally started to subside as the memories and feelings became easier to digest.

"...I see," he muttered.

The blinding light that the book he was reading back at the apartment was emitting.

Suddenly finding himself in an abandoned city out of nowhere.

The person he saw in the reflection of the car window.

A bewildered sigh escaped his lips as he realized what exactly had happened.

"I am inside the book Path of Heroes..."

He found it hard to believe his own words.

"And the body that I am inhabiting... I am not Leo Karumi anymore. Instead—"

"I am Azriel Crimson."

*********

Azriel Crimson.

A character never mentioned in the book.

Nothing was known about him, and he had no relevance to the plot in the slightest.

A mere extra.

Or at least, not quite entirely.

The only reason for his existence was perhaps that the author had an excuse for the protagonist to get close to one of the main heroines: Jasmine Crimson, the next head of the Crimson clan and one of the most talented geniuses on Earth.

She was also the president of the student council in the hero academy and one of the main characters in Path of Heroes.

Yes, Azriel's elder sister who, in the book, at first seemed cold to everyone after becoming depressed and closing off her heart to anyone after someone extremely close to her died.

The protagonist, being kind-hearted in nature, tried to comfort her and help her get over the loss of her important someone, and in the end, succeeded in winning her heart after many attempts.

It looked like that important someone was her younger brother, Azriel Crimson, as it was never mentioned who the close person to her was by anyone, not even the Crimson clan.

The Crimson clan was one of the four great clans that ruled the Asian continent.

The Crimson clan's current head was Joaquin Crimson, his wife being Aeliana Crimson.

As Leo, or better said now Azriel, recalled how his elder sister, whom he now had, would get into the harem of the protagonist, his face changed to one of disgust.

He already hated people who had harems, as he believed those were the ones who couldn't stay loyal or love someone enough.

Besides, the protagonist was someone equally loved and hated by the gods, attracting danger wherever he went.

"Like hell I would let him get together with her," he vowed as he got up again, stretching his body.

No brother would want his sister to be in danger constantly

Inheriting the previous owner's feelings and memories, they were now essentially his own.

He had become that person.

"I am sorry for what happened to you ... I know this might sound like just some pathetic excuse to the both of us, but I promise I will protect our family," Azriel said, promising to the current him and the former him.

A tear leaked from his right eye that he hurriedly wiped away.

Everything and everyone he knew from his previous life was gone.

Forever.

Chapter 3: The City of Love
"...Now what?"

Azriel was confused as he looked back at his own reflection in the mirror of the car. His hair had grown out and was unkempt, indicating that a while had passed since the last of his memories.

"I wonder what happened to... Father."

It still felt a little weird suddenly calling someone else his father, but just like the memories he inherited, he also did the same with everything else from the previous Azriel Crimson.

"Right, I can check my status."

Status refers to a holographic interface that showcases a person's information, which is only visible to the person themselves. With their status screen, someone could at the very least easily find out what their affinities are.

One could only unlock their affinities after they become a grade 3 awakened.

There are only two methods that can help you upgrade a human's mana core.

The first is one that no one actually prefers, which is trying to consume the mana in the air.

This can get quite tiring, and the progress is extremely slow compared to the other method.

The second method is the easiest to upgrade or at least kind of easy since all you have to do is consume the mana core of a void creature.

The mana cores for both void creatures and humans are next to their hearts, though the position of the heart for certain void creatures will be different.

The mana core will still be there. After killing the void creatures, you are supposed to dig out the mana core and consume it.

This method is the easiest way for someone to get stronger and is much more efficient.

Though perhaps it wasn't the easiest and... safest.

Of course, consuming the mana core of a Grade 3 Abyssal will be much more beneficial than that of a Grade 3 demon, but that is only if the human who kills the Grade 3 Abyssal is also a Grade 3 advanced.

If a Grade 3 Expert tries to consume a mana core of a Grade 3 demon, they will barely get any benefit from it.

Also, the mana cores of a void creature that died don't last forever, meaning they will start to deteriorate and lose their worth after 2-48 hours have passed.

The higher ranked the void creature, the longer its mana core will last.

"Before I see my status though, I need to check one thing,"

Azriel said with a little excitement and anticipation in his voice.

He was transmigrated into a book, so doesn't that mean like most similar stories he has read that he will have something unique to him to help him get stronger like the protagonist has?

"System."

Yet, to his immense disappointment, he didn't get the system perk like the protagonist has.

The damn protagonist isn't even a transmigrator like him!

"...How unfair."

He was becoming a little depressed as he thought he would have the benefits like the protagonist.

The system was basically what it says, a system that only the protagonist of Path of Heroes could see.

It gave him a lot of benefits and made it much easier for him to get stronger, being able to buy health potions, sword arts, and even unlocking more affinities the stronger he grows and mana cores of void creatures that were on his level.

Obviously, the system didn't just hand them to the protagonist since he had to complete quests for them which perhaps were quite fair for the rewards he got.

"Still, I wish I had a system."

As Azriel muttered to himself, he decided to check his status window instead.

"Status"

-----------------------------

"...Huh."

Azriel's mind blanked as he read his status window.

He knew for a fact that before everything in his memories stopped, he was only a Grade 2 Awakened, but now he somehow became a Grade 3 Intermediate.

He was already at the same level as the protagonist at the age of 16!

...And 16.

Azriel's blood went cold as he realized how long ago the last of his memories were. He was only 14 years old before everything went black.

"So it has been 2 years... 2 years of memories missing or perhaps I really died not only in my previous world but also in this world but got reincarnated in this body?"

"Son of Death."

Muttering the title he had gotten, he read the description.

-----------------------------

[Son of Death]: The god of death has taken pity on you and decided to bless you with another chance at life and additional benefits... make the best of this life.

-----------------------------

Azriel sucked in a cold breath at reading the description of his title. He didn't know what to really think of all of this. A god actually giving him a second chance because of... pity.

"So that means the gods are real now?"

As Azriel said to himself, he decided to check on his unique skill [Redo]. A unique skill is something everyone gets after they reach Grade 3 Intermediate rank.

But he couldn't ever recall in his memories there being a unique skill that was only usable once. Not wasting time, he decided to read its description.

-----------------------------

[Redo]: Given the unique title by the god of death itself and its blessings, you have earned a skill never seen or heard of before. Being the son of death means that death isn't something you should fear.

-----------------------------

"Eh?"

"To be able to cheat death... this is crazy!"

The chances of dying in this world were already as huge as they could get, but now he had a skill that gave him another chance.

"To think that the god of death would be so generous!"

Azriel said happily with a smile on his face. Being happy, he looked towards the sword arts.

He remembered that he never got any sword arts, meaning that this was something the god of death also blessed him with.

"I definitely won't complain about not having a system anymore."

Having a sword art called [Dance of Death] that is probably never seen or heard of like the unique skill [Redo] he has was already something extremely valuable, though he wasn't going to get overconfident since he would prefer not using [Redo] ever.

"Void Eater, huh... the sword that... father... has gifted me after killing my first void creature."

He was happy that he still at least had the trusted sword that had accompanied his previous self, though he unfortunately never got a soul armor.

Looking towards the [Soul Echoes] that were locked, he knew that this would be unlocked when he reached Grade 3 Expert.

Hell, he knew that a Master and Grandmaster would get even more, but the weird [???] shouldn't show up on his status at all just like [Soul Echoes].

"So another benefit from having the death god's blessing, huh?"

After calming down again, Azriel started to walk around.

He knew he was probably in a death zone since everything was abandoned and broken.

The chances of him encountering a void creature were big if he stayed in one place for too long, and he wasn't eager to meet them yet.

Even though he had the experiences of the previous Azriel, his mind and body were still trying to sort everything out.

His entire life had changed so fast.

Yet...

His heart was beating loudly against his chest as he gazed at the old, ruined buildings.

"...This place."

He really hoped that perhaps he was wrong and just being paranoid.

But the more he walked and explored, the more he started to fear the worst.

The city he was in had become a ghostly wasteland, with buildings crumbling, streets cracked, and deserted. Nature had taken back what was once its own, and the air was heavy with the scent of decay.

When he finally stopped, he gazed at a tall structure, freezing as his heart skipped a beat.

In front of him was once a majestic monument, a symbol of human achievement, now standing in ruins. Rust corroded its iron framework, and vines and moss had claimed its surfaces, turning the metal into a dark, twisted skeleton of its former self.

Gazing at the once beautiful monument that stood at the pinnacle of human achievements 150 years ago, he realized where he was.

...Europe.

Namely, in The City of Love.

"Dammit."

Chapter 4: Death's Blossom
The last place he had expected to find himself was Europe.

The worst continent he could possibly be in.

Everywhere in Europe except for the North was basically a death zone.

"You have to be joking with me, right!?"

"Not even [Redo] will be able to save me here!"

Sure, [Redo] might give him another chance, but that is only one time!

He was sure that just staying an entire day here in the middle of Europe would get him killed multiple times by the harrowing creatures residing here.

Perhaps the god of death wasn't as generous as he had thought.

He could already imagine the death god laughing at him from above, dressed in a black robe that covered everything except the part of his face surrounded by dark mist, holding a long, black, creepy scythe in his right hand.

Or perhaps from below?

As if confirming his thoughts, he could hear the sound of thunder behind the grey clouds looming over the city.

"Dammit! I really need to get awa-"

Azriel couldn't finish speaking as suddenly he heard a howl coming from behind, making him break out in a cold sweat.

Turning around nervously, he saw the very things he had tried to avoid at the end of the street.

Five wolf-like creatures stood there, glaring at him with pitch-black eyes. Their bodies, stripped of fur, revealed naked, scarred, and blackened skin, with some parts rotten and decayed.

The inside of their cheeks was visible, their gums exposed, and saliva dripped continuously from their gaping mouths, pooling on the floor.

The smell they gave off was horrible, making Azriel swallow the vomit that rose into his throat.

'... why couldn't I be sent into a romcom world, dammit!'

Screaming inside his mind, Azriel guided the mana in his eyes, peering into the mana cores of the void creatures in front of him.

"Three of them are just Grade 3 beasts, but the last two are a Grade 2 and Grade 1 beast..."

The Grade 1 beast was even missing one of its eyes, making it look even more terrifying.

Though Azriel was a little more relieved now, since the void creatures in front of him were supposedly weaker than him...

Supposedly.

The problem he was currently having was that his body felt extremely tired, and so did his mind.

The fact that the last time he had fought a void creature was more than two years ago was clear from his memories.

While being the son of the Crimson clan, he was also just an average teenage high schooler!

'Calm down, Le- Azriel... I am stronger... stronger than these do-'

"Eek!"

An unexpected high-pitched scream escaped his lips as the scary void wolves suddenly started walking towards him.

"A-ah... you won't harm me, right?"

"You guys are good little p-puppies, right?"

As a response, two of the Grade 3 void wolves lunged at him.

'Guess not!'

A katana materialized in his right hand, its blade pitch black, devoid of any color as if consumed by darkness itself. The hilt was adorned with intricate patterns of black and red.

Void Eater.

The katana his father had gifted him...

His very own soul weapon that grows stronger the more he does, unlike the other ranked weapons.

The appearance of mana changed everything on Earth. Mana stones became a reality, leading to the creation of stronger structures and more powerful weapons.

A weapon created by mana stones could be empowered by one's own mana, resulting in it being able to be wielded by, for example, a master-ranked human.

Of course, a master-ranked human won't be able to handle or wield the weapon of a saint, and the weapon of an expert would simply break if wielded by a master-ranked human, making it expensive for many humans to become heroes since they needed to buy a new weapon each time they ranked up.

Luckily for those who have a soul weapon, they don't have that problem.

Perhaps due to all the training he underwent as Azriel, ingrained in his mind, he instinctively positioned Void Eater in front of him just in time as the first void wolf bit down on it, causing sparks to fly.

Luckily, being a Grade 3 Intermediate, his sword was also far stronger than the sharp teeth of a mere Grade 3 beast.

He kicked the wolf with his right leg, sending it flying back towards the other void wolves who were watching.

As he spun to his left, he felt mana coursing through his veins from his mana core.

"[Frost Wall]!" he shouted towards the second Grade 3 wolf lunging at him.

Moments later, a wall of ice emerged between Azriel and the approaching beast.

His heart thumped loudly against his chest as adrenaline surged through him.

"I am Azriel. Remember that. Not Leo anymore, but Azriel... No," he muttered to himself.

"That's not right."

"I'm not just Azriel, nor Leo anymore—"

"I am both of them."

"Not an extra or an ordinary high schooler anymore."

"Not the boy who lost his family in a car accident."

"Not the extra who died as a plot device for the heroine and protagonist to get together."

"...Azriel Crimson."

Someone who wouldn't tread the path of an ordinary or forgotten extra.

The ice wall shattered as all three Grade 3 beasts decided to attack him instead of just one.

Their razor-sharp teeth gleamed as they lunged with mouths wide open.

He sensed the bloodlust in their pitch-black eyes.

Strangely, his mind became extremely calm as he faced the oncoming beasts, unafraid.

Time seemed to slow down as another wave of information flooded his mind effortlessly.

Red lightning crackled around Azriel's body as black mist poured from his mouth.

The mist and lightning coiled around Void Eater.

And then—

"First Form: Death's Blossom."

Azriel muttered as the void wolves closed in, mere inches from his face, ready to have him as their meal.

Only for him to suddenly vanish from his spot, reappearing a few meters behind the Grade 3 beasts and in front of the Grade 2 and Grade 1 beasts.

A beautiful, trail-like dance of red lightning and dark mist surrounded Azriel and the Grade 3 beasts before the mist transformed into black roses, crackling with red lightning. They dissipated into the air moments later.

Swinging Void Eater, black blood splattered the ground as Azriel heard three thuds behind him.

Turning back, he saw the lifeless bodies of the Grade 3 beasts lying on the street, blood spurting from their cleanly decapitated necks.

Azriel's blood-red eyes looked dead.

There was no emotion in those eyes—dull, devoid of life.

Only for in the next second a status update happened that showed in his vision:

-----------------------------

Status Update!

-----------------------------

First form acquired!

[Sword Arts]: Dance of Death -> 5% mastery [1/?]

-> [First Form]: Death's Blossom

-----------------------------

Seeing the sudden status update in front of him, he snapped out of his state as he looked bewildered at the changes of his status and the lifeless bodies of the Grade 3 beasts.

After that, he looked towards the Grade 2 and Grade 1 beasts who were looking at him cautiously, and he swore he could see something in those black eyes of theirs...

...fear?

Glancing between them, he only had one thought in his mind:

"What just happened?"

Chapter 5: Ragnar Frost
"Death's... Blossom."

Everything that had just happened felt so weird.

It was like he was in some sort of lucid dream.

"First form, huh? And it doesn't even show me how many forms there are,"

Azriel muttered, gazing at the three headless bodies.

Strangely, he didn't feel as tired as he had thought he would.

Sure, it did cost some mana to perform the Dance of Death's first form, but not as much as he had expected.

"Perhaps I judged the god of death a little too earl-"

He couldn't finish speaking as the grade 1 wolf suddenly lunged at him.

Caught off guard, Azriel didn't have enough time to move his entire body out of the way or raise Void Eater.

Tilting his body sideways, he quickly froze his right shoulder blade with ice before the beast could bite into it, deflecting it from his neck.

Crack!

The sound of ice shattering echoed as the teeth sank into his right shoulder.

"Argh!"

"That fucking hurts!"

Screaming from the pain that nearly made him lose consciousness, he bit his tongue. His left hand crackled with red lightning as he plunged it into the void wolf's head, frying its brain.

The sensation of his hand penetrating its brain and the sickening crunch of the skull breaking made Azriel grit his teeth and swallow the vomit rising in his throat.

"Shit, this feels so disgusting."

Removing his hand from its head, the wolf fell with a thud on the ground next to him. His left hand was painted black from its blood, making Azriel want to retch.

Realizing he was about to get distracted again, he gripped his katana tighter and hurriedly looked towards where the last remaining void wolf was.

The grade 2 beast wasn't there anymore...

No matter where he turned his head, he couldn't see the wolf anywhere. After an entire minute, he realized that the wolf had actually fled.

"I guess that's why he had two eyes, unlike this one..."

It seemed the grade 2 wolf was smart enough to understand that it would have died as well after seeing the sudden death of its three companions.

"Tch, I always liked cats more!"

Saying that, he froze the wound on his right shoulder again, stopping the bleeding. He didn't have anything with him to help heal his wounds.

"Mmpfh!"

'Dammit, it really hurts getting bitten by those skinless dogs! Well, I shouldn't have been zoning out in the first place, I guess...'

He was lucky to use his ice fast enough, or else the grade 1 beast would have bitten his entire arm off.

'...Damn, I feel cold.'

Azriel wasn't wearing anything except for some torn, ragged clothes, and adding that to the ice on his body only made him tremble more as his teeth started to clatter.

"Right, I should harvest those mana cores, probably," he muttered to himself.

He decided to absorb their mana cores before any other void creatures found him. He was sure his fight with the void wolves had attracted some of them.

Though whether someone as insignificant as him would be worth killing or eating by the higher-ranked void creatures, he wasn't really eager to find out.

With his katana, he made a precise incision near where the heart would be. The blade slid through the flesh easily, but the sickly warmth and the smell of blood and offal made him gag. His hand trembled slightly as he reached into the body, feeling around for the mana core.

When his fingers brushed against the smooth, hard surface, he grimaced and pulled it out, covered in blood and bits of tissue.

"Ugh, that's disgusting," he muttered.

Moving to the next body, the process didn't get any easier. Each time he had to reach into the carcass, the nauseating sensation of warm blood and the slick, slimy texture of organs made him retch.

"I want to take a shower..."

********

"Haa..."

A tired sigh escaped Ragnar's lips as he walked through the corridors of a military base established in France — a safe zone.

Ragnar was undeniably handsome, with hair as pure and white as freshly fallen snow, cascading in smooth waves down to his shoulders.

His piercing blue eyes resembled sapphires, sparkling with an intensity that seemed to penetrate the soul.

He appeared to be in his late twenties, with chiseled, refined features. High cheekbones framed a strong jawline.

There was a maturity in his gaze that spoke of countless experiences.

Yet, what truly set him apart, making everyone he passed bow their heads in fear and respect, was the palpable aura of strength and authority he radiated. His presence alone had the ability to instill both awe and tremors in those who saw him.

A Grade 1 Grandmaster — the head of the Frost Clan, one of the four great clans ruling the Asian continent. The Crimson Clan ruled the eastern parts, while the Frost Clan governed northern Asia.

Walking a step behind him was his trusted right-hand man and servant, Thomas. Though not as handsome as his lord, Thomas was undeniably one of the most handsome men alive.

His silky blond hair and emerald eyes shone like countless stars in a dark night. While Thomas wasn't a Grade 1 Grandmaster like his lord, he was still a Grade 3 Grandmaster.

"The government agent said you need to stay in France for a few more days, my lord, instead of leaving today," Thomas said respectfully as they continued toward the control room.

"And who the hell do they think they are?" Ragnar retorted.

"Remind him and them that the Frost Clan doesn't work for the government, nor do they have the power to command us."

To the public, Ragnar was here to demonstrate that the four great clans of Asia, particularly the Frost Clan, supported and collaborated with the government to reclaim Europe.

But the main reason was something else...

There have been multiple reports of possible Phase 4 voidrifts appearing in France and Spain, yet nothing of the sort has happened yet.

Ragnar had been staying here for over a week because humanity couldn't afford to let all their hard-won control that they barely had in Western Europe go in vain.

However, there had been no signs of any void rifts appearing whatsoever in the past week. Not only that, there had been no signs of a void creature above the Monarch rank in France at all.

"We will leave today after one final check-up," Ragnar declared, showing his indifference to staying longer in this compromised country.

"I'll dispatch a few of our own to stay here and assist the military if necessary." he continued.

"Actually, my lord... There seems to be interference with the signals, making it currently impossible to contact anyone outside of Europe, though travel between continents seems unaffected," Thomas reported.

Ragnar halted, a scowl forming on his face as he faced Thomas. The bad feeling he had only intensified.

"How long has this issue been occurring?" Ragnar demanded.

"...Since the last hour," Thomas replied calmly, though a slight cold sweat betrayed his concern.

Ragnar shook his head and resumed walking.

"It doesn't matter. We are leaving today no matter what. Inform the government that the Frost Clan will send their representatives only once the signal is restored."

He was determined to return to Asia, not to the north but to the east instead. Tomorrow was an extremely important day for his best friend, Joaquin Crimson.

Unlike what many believed, the four great clans harbored no animosity among them — at least, not entirely. The Crimson Clan and the Frost Clan shared the strongest bond among the four.

Perhaps because of this, most preferred Asia, where the four great clans worked together competently instead of fighting each other.

This cooperation was also why the Hero Academy was located there — maintaining Asia's peace was crucial, as the fall of any great clan could lead to chaos.

Joaquin and Ragnar had been friends since childhood, attending the Hero Academy together.

And tomorrow... it would be the day after the birthday of Joaquin's only son, Azriel Crimson, who had been presumed dead or missing for the past two years.

'...they still haven't accepted his death after all. Well, it's not like they ever found his body or even knew exactly what happened,' Ragnar thought somberly, reflecting on the grief Joaquin and his family must be experiencing.

Finally, Ragnar and Thomas arrived at the control room.

Yet, as they approached, both men sensed something was amiss. They listened intently to the conversation unfolding inside.

"Do you think he actually killed those four Void Wolves by himself?"

"Well, do you see anyone else with him?"

"...still, he looks so young."

"And handsome."

"Quickly, save this footage for later..."

"What if he isn't human but actually a skinwalker?"

"Skinwalker or not, this could sell for a lot of money."

"Could be true, but he could also be a wanderer?"

A "wanderer" often refers to a human who has been unfortunate enough to find themselves in a death zone after entering and exiting a void rift.

Intrigued by their discussion, Ragnar moved forward with Thomas, suppressing their presence as they approached a massive holographic screen at the front of the control room.

It displayed footage from a drone positioned directly in front of a young teenage boy...

The boy sat nonchalantly on the corpse of a headless Voidwolf, playing with its empty mana core using his left hand, which was stained black with the beast's blood. A pitch-black katana was embedded in the ground beside him.

With messy, long black hair and blood-red eyes, his torn clothes and a patch of ice on his right shoulder suggested the recent battle that took place.

His hair fluttered in the wind as he stared directly into the drone's camera with a small smile.

Suddenly, he tapped the drone lightly with his right hand, causing it and the camera to sway.

"Hello? Does this thing have a mic?"

Chapter 6: Hope and Doubts
If there was one word to describe the scene in front of him, it was "art."

He would have definitely bought a painting of it if it was on the market.

'That boy... why does he feel so familiar? And not only that, but that katana—'

'Void Eater!?'

It didn't take more than a few seconds for Ragnar to recognize the katana next to the boy.

How couldn't he?

After all, Void Eater originally belonged to his best friend, rival, and someone he considered a brother.

The number of times the two of them had clashed, and Ragnar had bled because of Void Eater...

He knew that Void Eater was eventually gifted to his only son, Azriel.

'...That boy... no, impossible. It can't be.'

It didn't take much longer for him to connect the dots as he gazed at the boy with trembling eyes.

Not just him—even Thomas gazed at the boy in utter horror.

"Lord Ragnar!"

"Grandmaster Thomas!"

Finally, the others noticed the presence of Ragnar and Thomas and bowed their heads instantly in respect.

"This is live footage, right?" Thomas asked, his voice trembling slightly as he gazed at the operators with narrowed eyes.

They nodded their heads lightly, confused by their reactions.

"Yes, Grandmaster Thomas, this is live footage from Paris where the boy is. We haven't yet discovered if it is a skinwalker, some other type of void creature, or a wanderer."

"Did you guys run facial recognition?" Ragnar suddenly spoke, his cold, narrowed eyes sweeping past each one of them, making them tremble and break out in a cold sweat.

"W-we have, Lord Ragnar, but we haven't found a match—"

"Azriel Crimson," Ragnar interrupted, making everyone look at him wide-eyed.

"W-what?" The female operator was bewildered, as were all the operators, hearing the sudden name of the son of the Crimson Clan.

Though Azriel Crimson was known for almost never showing his face to the public, that only made him even more mysterious and popular.

And the thing that stood out the most...

Rumors had been circulating that Azriel Crimson had been missing or dead for the past two years.

Obviously, the four great clans and the government tried their best to suppress the rumors as much as they could.

Only the gods could tell the aftermath if the only son of one of the four great clans had died somehow.

"Do I have to repeat myself?" Ragnar spoke, his voice growing colder as the operators in the room felt a shiver run down their spines.

"N-no! Apologies, we are doing it right away!"

Not a moment later, one of the male operators behind their computers shouted, bringing everyone's gaze towards him.

"We got a match!"

Though no one shared his enthusiasm in the slightest as Ragnar's and Thomas's faces became grim.

Everyone gulped, seeing the atmosphere grow even colder.

"Give me a way to speak to him," Ragnar demanded.

An operator handed him a headset with a built-in microphone, allowing him to speak through the drone.

'...It can't be him, no matter what.'

'If it really is him, then where was he all along? How did he survive these past two years?'

'As a wanderer, there was just no way he could survive this long in the void realm all on his own at only this age.'

"The gods must be playing some cruel joke on us, my lord..." Thomas spoke softly, yet the words echoed through everyone's ears.

Today was...

Azriel Crimson's birthday.

No one believed in the slightest that the boy in the footage was actually Azriel Crimson.

It just wouldn't make sense.

Surviving all this time alone in the void realm or in Europe...

'If it is a skinwalker, then I will personally go there and kill it with my own hands...'

As he was about to speak, he hesitated.

'...What if it really is him?'

What if there was a slight possible chance that Azriel Crimson had somehow survived?

A slight hope ignited in his heart at the possibility of Azriel's survival.

Though he didn't interact as much as he did with his father, that didn't mean he didn't care for the boy.

If anything were to ever happen to Joaquin or Aeliana, he would have instantly adopted the two children and raised them as his own.

Not just that, he actually liked Azriel the most.

Though most couldn't see it, Ragnar clearly could.

The boy was talented.

Extremely so.

But for some reason, he never decided to reveal his talent and always tried to hold himself back whenever Ragnar saw him spar.

'I need to know more. There are so many unknowns here.'

"Can you hear me?" Ragnar spoke calmly with his usual indifferent attitude, addressing the boy.

A surprised expression came on Azriel's face before it turned into a relieved smile.

"Ah! Yes, I can!"

"What a relief. You see, I am, uh, what was it called again? Oh yes! A wanderer," he said, nodding to himself as he spoke cheerfully towards the drone's camera.

"I would appreciate it if I could get rescued, as I don't really think I will survive here much longer," he said with a bitter smile on his face.

Yet Ragnar merely narrowed his eyes at the boy.

No one spoke or dared to make a sound as they gazed between Ragnar and the boy, listening intently.

That voice... Ragnar had forgotten the sound of Joaquin's son's voice.

It is said that one's voice is the first thing you forget after someone close to you dies.

But...

'...Something is wrong.'

'Why is he so... unbothered?'

'For someone who is wandering in a dangerous part of Europe, he seems way too calm for some reason... like the void creatures won't attack him.'

'But he has already killed a few beasts...'

Doubts began to rise in Ragnar as he found the boy might not be Azriel after all.

"Something seems suspicious, my lord."

"Perhaps even a trap," Thomas said softly, his eyes glued to the holographic screen.

Ragnar merely hummed in response.

'He's right. Perhaps it is a trap to lure us out... is it really a skinwalker then?'

Hope and doubt clashed within Ragnar as he didn't know how to approach this situation.

'Is today meant to be a gift or a curse?'

The only way for him to confirm that the boy was really Azriel was to go there himself or send Thomas.

But he didn't know if going there was safe or not.

If it really was a skinwalker, he had no idea how it had gotten the body of Azriel Crimson.

There could be more lurking.

Their strength and numbers were unknown.

Suddenly, his eyes widened.

'Could this be the reason we can't use our devices to communicate outside Europe? And the sudden disappearance of the leviathan-ranked void creature that was sleeping in Belgium?'

'...The monarch and titan ranks are also, for some reason, missing.'

A shiver ran down his spine again as he gritted his teeth.

"Be ready to send a message when I give the signal towards the other military bases in Europe for a possible phase six or perhaps even a phase seven category danger level in France."

Hearing his words, it felt like a thunderbolt had struck each one of them inside the control room.

The room became even more deathly silent as they all looked at Ragnar's pale face in pure horror.

A phase seven danger level would indicate the appearance of a phase seven void rift, which had never happened.

"...There is a possibility that the one we are looking at is a Defiled Skinwalker, perhaps a little lower, but it would make sense that a phase seven void rift has appeared without us noticing, and why the leviathan-ranked void creature has gone missing with the others."

Ragnar elaborated, but no one was relieved in the slightest as dread filled their hearts.

Was Europe doomed to stay fallen?

What continent was going to be next?

How many of those nightmares lurking in the void realm would keep appearing?

Everyone's mind was spinning with various thoughts before Ragnar spoke again.

"I might possibly be wrong as well... that is why we should wait with the signal. There is a possibility that the one in front of us is actually Azriel Crimson."

"My lord, we should keep asking him questions," Thomas spoke again, reminding Ragnar that the boy was waiting for a reply.

Ragnar could see that the boy was looking at the camera with a tense smile.

'...It really looks like Azriel, but just more grown-up and... he has become more handsome.'

He really hoped he was just being paranoid.

But the horrors he had encountered in the void realm...

He knew it was better to be prepared for the worst.

"Let me ask you a simple question first."

"What is your name?"

Hearing his question, the smile disappeared from the boy's face as a complicated expression showed.

'If it really is a skinwalker, it must be the best one of its kind in mimicking human expressions,' Ragnar thought, as the hope in him burned slightly again.

Perhaps he was wrong.

'Please be wrong...'

Praying inside his mind, the boy finally answered his question with a complicated voice.

"I don't know if you already know, perhaps you do and want to confirm it from my own mouth..."

"My name is Azriel Crimson, son of Joaquin and Aeliana Crimson."

Ragnar gritted his teeth at hearing Azriel's voice.

'Damn it! Should I go see for myself!?'

"...My lord, we need to keep asking him questions. A skinwalker only inherits part of one's memories," Thomas advised as Ragnar nodded with a grim expression.

"What if it isn't a skinwalker but some other unidentified void creature?" Someone mumbled, but everyone heard the male operator as they all turned to him.

Ragnar and Thomas glanced at him for a second before looking at Azriel again.

Ragnar spoke this time

not into the mic, but towards the operator and perhaps for himself and everyone there.

"Then this world really is doomed from the start."

Chapter 7: Solomon Dragonheart
"Prepare Special Force Alpha Squad and Beta Squad for a rescue mission," Ragnar ordered abruptly, leaving everyone looking bewildered but no one objected.

"Also, prepare the medical team," he added, glancing at Azriel's frozen shoulder through the holographic screen.

"We need to hurry with the interrogation. It isn't smart for him to stay in one place if he really is Azriel Crimson," Thomas added lightly beside Ragnar.

"We'll leave once the SFAQ and SFBQ, along with the medical team, are done preparing. If we don't have our answer by then, we will confirm it with our own eyes," Ragnar spoke again, his gaze fixed on Azriel as he turned on his mic.

"How can we really know if you are truly Azriel Crimson?" he asked, observing Azriel's furrowed eyebrows.

Ragnar was determined not to miss any detail in Azriel's expression, using everything he could to determine his true identity.

"...if I am truly Azriel Crimson?" Azriel muttered to himself through the drone, and before Ragnar could elaborate, Azriel's eyes widened.

"Wait, you don't mean if I am one of those skinwalkers, right?" Azriel's surprise made Ragnar grit his teeth.

'Dammit, what else am I supposed to think? There couldn't be so many coincidences at once!' Ragnar struggled to control his emotions.

After a few seconds, Ragnar spoke again, trying to regain composure.

"...Can you really blame us? Azriel Crimson, son of Joaquin Crimson and Aeliana Crimson, suddenly showing up in the middle of Europe." Ragnar narrowed his eyes at Azriel through the screen, his face showing a complicated expression.

"... That voice," Azriel suddenly spoke, his voice hesitant.

"Is that you, Uncle Ragnar...?"

Ragnar's eyes widened for a second before he resumed his usual cold demeanor.

'No, it could still be a skinwalker that probably has his memories... But then how and when did that happen?'

"Ah, I'm sorry it took me this long to recognize your voice. My body and head aren't exactly in the greatest condition since I didn't exactly have the most comfortable experience arriving here in Paris," Azriel explained, scratching the back of his head awkwardly while laughing.

"Well, this would at least explain why you are so cautious of me."

"A-!?" Before Ragnar could respond, an abnormal presence was felt in the control room or the entire base, making everyone tense.

"Who is there!?"

"Huh?"

Ragnar and Thomas couldn't turn their heads, feeling a pressure preventing their movement, as a voice spoke behind them.

"Haha! Well, of course, I doubt a mere child would consider it fun finding themselves in Europe~"

Not a single person in the room failed to recognize the voice.

Ragnar's eyes widened in shock, as did Thomas's.

'Why is he here!?'

Screaming inside his mind, the pressure suddenly dissipated, making everyone sigh in relief.

Turning around, he saw the last person he expected to meet, narrowing his eyes at Thomas and Ragnar dangerously, making both break out in a cold sweat.

The man's eyes weren't smiling in the slightest...

The man in front of him had short crimson hair, vibrant and rare as freshly spilled blood, framing his face with striking allure.

His eyes, matching in intensity, gleamed with a deep, captivating red. Each strand of his hair shimmered in the faint light.

"S-Saint Solomon!?" One of the operators shouted, everyone dropping to one knee, heads bowing, except for Ragnar and Thomas.

Cutting off his mic, Ragnar addressed Solomon.

"Saint Solomon, what are you doing here exactly?"

Solomon maintained his smile as he shook his head exaggeratedly.

"What's the matter, Grandmaster Ragnar? I finished the video game I was playing at home and decided to get some fresh air."

'Fresh air in Europe!?' Veins bulged on Ragnar's forehead as he took a deep breath.

'Calm down, Ragnar. He's still a saint...'

Thomas decided to stay out of it, gazing instead at Azriel, who was impatiently eyeing the drone.

"Besides, I felt the mana of that baby Leviathan suddenly disappear an hour ago. Since you were already here and most competent, I thought perhaps you knew something," Solomon added, making Ragnar narrow his eyes.

"...So you noticed, huh?"

"Hmm? Oh yes, can someone give me one of those headsets so I can speak to him?" Solomon asked casually.

An operator rushed forward with trembling hands, handing Solomon the headset and then darting away without looking at his face.

"Hahah! You guys don't need to be so tense around me," Solomon chuckled, seeing the reactions before putting on the headset.

"Hello, test test, can you hear me?"

Azriel's face showed surprise as he recognized the voice instantly.

"Saint Solomon?"

"Ah! I knew you would recognize me instantly, unlike this boring gramps!" Solomon said excitedly, causing veins to pop on Ragnar's head.

'Since when did I get old!?'

"Should I consider this good luck or bad luck for you being here..."

Hearing Azriel mumble, Ragnar was confused but chose not to speak, letting Solomon handle it.

'This has become such a mess. Dammit, and what is taking the SFAQ and SFBQ with the medical squad so long?'

A sigh escaped Ragnar's lips as he anticipated the headaches from the great clans and the government once they found out.

"Eh? I mean, why would you consider me bad luck? And besides, didn't I always tell you to call me Uncle Solomon, like you do with the old man?"

Solomon's tone remained light-hearted, as if the situation was nothing serious at all, earning him odd looks.

"A-ah, I mean, it would be bad if you consider me a skinwalker as well, no? I'm not really that eager to die, you see," Azriel spoke nervously.

"Well then, are you a skinwalker or not?" Solomon asked bluntly, as if it were the most normal question.

"Huh, well, of course not."

"Well, there you have it!" Solomon exclaimed suddenly, making everyone flinch.

"Let me go and fetch you, okay? Try not to die in the next 15 minutes or so. See ya!" Solomon tossed the headset away and started walking towards the exit, leaving everyone baffled.

"W-Wait! We are already planning a rescue mission with the SFAQ and SFBQ!" Ragnar shouted, but Solomon waved his hand dismissively.

"Don't worry, don't worry, alright? I've already told them it's fine. Besides, I'm much faster and... stronger," Solomon assured as he left, the door closing slowly behind him.

"Huh, he's going to fetch me?" Azriel's voice came from behind, but Ragnar didn't turn to look at him through the holographic screen.

His eyes were fixed on the closing door, his face unreadable.

'So he already told them that it was fine, huh... He always reminds me in some way to never underestimate him despite that attitude of his...'

Even though everything had become a mess with Solomon...

'Perhaps it is for the best that he is the one going over to check if Azriel really is a skinwalker or not.'

After all...

Solomon Dragonheart was...

A Grade 2 Saint.

Chapter 8: 15 Minutes
'Solomon Dragonheart... to think he would be here as well with Ragnar Frost.' Azriel was deep in thought as he gazed at the drone hovering in front of him.

It was already a shock to him that his father's best friend Ragnar was here, but not only him, also one of the most talented humans in history.

Ragnar Frost, a rival of his father since childhood, was not just that but also the youngest head among the four great clans.

He didn't blame Ragnar for being so cautious since he would have done the same.

Besides...

'He lost his parents to skinwalkers seven years ago.'

Ragnar's mother was killed by a Grade 1 Titan-ranked skinwalker that, after taking her life, took her place and infiltrated the Frost estate, killing Ragnar's father and many other members of the Frost clan.

It was still known as one of Asia's greatest tragedies, but luckily they managed to take the skinwalker down. After that, Ragnar took the position of his father as the head of the Frost Clan.

1,259 people lost their lives because of a single skinwalker that took everyone by surprise.

'You can never know what might happen in this world, I suppose.'

Solomon Dragonheart was already a Grade 2 Saint at the age of 26, breaking the record of becoming the youngest saint in the entire world.

'A monster...'

He remembered that even though he didn't attend a lot of banquets or other social gatherings, the few he did attend, Solomon was always there as well.

And for some reason, the man always talked with Azriel.

'No, I know the reason very well...'

It was simply because Azriel was talented.

Yet, he never tried to show himself too much to the public or reveal his talent.

He'd rather train in secret or as much as he could. Of course, it was impossible to hide most things from his father or someone at the same level as him.

Like Ragnar and Solomon, who easily discovered how talented Azriel was but never tried to talk about it.

The reason for hiding his talent was simple.

Azriel just didn't want to bother competing with others and wanted to rather live a peaceful life instead.

There was no need for him to follow the same path as those close to him.

But of course, that didn't mean he slacked off entirely.

He trained diligently always, as his father understood his reason and made sure that he was still someone who could handle himself in combat when the need arose.

'Still, a lot of misunderstandings have come forth because of the previous Azriel's attitude...'

'Not that I don't understand him.'

Because of trying to hide his talents, obviously, people like Solomon got curious and always tried to talk to him and ask why he never revealed himself like his sister Jasmine.

Whenever Azriel talked with Solomon, he had one thought on his mind...

He was scary!

'That fucking creepy smile of his! And that look in his eyes!'

Shouting inside his mind, he suddenly heard Ragnar speaking through the drone.

"Azriel, Saint Solomon should arrive at your location in approximately 15 minutes."

'Fifteen minutes... good. I am really feeling tired and just want to sleep, dammit.

To think so many things would happen in such a short amount of time.'

Just for wanting to get a glass of water, he got transported into another world!

"I see, that is good to hear by the—?"

Azriel suddenly stopped talking as he noticed that the ground was enveloped in fog.

"The fuck?"

"Uncle Ragnar, do you know what is happening...?" The drone was luckily still close to him so he could still communicate with Ragnar.

Or so he at least hoped, but for some reason, he didn't hear any response from Ragnar.

A chill ran down his spine as he suddenly shot up and picked Void Eater, gripping it tightly.

'Dammit, what the hell is happening now?'

"Azri... can... hear me!? ...sten... un! ...ast!"

Suddenly he heard the voice of Ragnar through the drone, but he couldn't make out what he was saying as his voice kept getting cut off.

"What are you saying? I can't hear you. Your voice keeps cutting off!"

He could hear his heart pounding in his ears as he gripped his katana even tighter.

'...I should have moved to another location. Shit.'

The only sound was the wind howling, the drone next to him barely audible because of its advanced equipment.

The fog had already reached his knees and was rising slowly, steadily.

It seemed endless, an infinite blanket of gray.

Azriel's eyes darted everywhere, the silence around him becoming increasingly oppressive.

Ragnar's voice from the drone was gone.

'Fifteen minutes... just survive for fifteen minutes.'

Repeating this in his mind, he suddenly felt every hair on his body stand on end.

"Don't go."

"!?"

A voice suddenly whispered in his ear. He didn't waste time, leaping forward to distance himself.

Turning around quickly, he saw nothing where he had been standing.

The drone was gone too, consumed by the ever-rising fog, now up to his waist.

"W-what..."

Whoever had whispered in his ear was nowhere to be found.

His heart was beating so loudly it felt like it might explode.

He felt his blood run cold as he grit his teeth, trying to prevent his legs from shaking.

'R-run. I need to run and survive... Fifteen minutes. Ragnar said fifteen minutes until Solomon gets here. No way am I dying now and using [Redo].'

In the first place, he didn't even know how [Redo] would work.

Would it send him back in time, or would it regenerate his body?

He'd rather not find out.

"Azriel, can you hear me!? Azriel!"

Suddenly, Ragnar's voice came through, but he couldn't pinpoint its location.

It was as if Ragnar's voice was coming from everywhere around him.

'Just what the hell is happening!?'

"If you hear me, get out of there immediately! Don't stay in that fog no matter what!"

Ragnar's shout was enough to propel Azriel into a desperate sprint.

Yet it was too late.

The fog had risen to a level that obscured everything.

'Damn it! There has to be an end somewhere!'

He kept running straight, but no matter how far he went, nothing changed.

His surroundings were enveloped in a thick, unyielding fog.

He didn't know what void creature it belonged to, but he didn't want to find out.

'Run! Just keep running! Don't look back!'

"!?"

Azriel stopped in his tracks as he suddenly saw a dark silhouette ahead.

"W-what is that..."

Another chill ran down his spine, every fiber of his being telling him to run.

Yet he couldn't.

His feet were firmly planted on the ground, his eyes unable to look away from the dark silhouette.

Something told him...

If he looked away for even a second, he would die.

He couldn't make out the figure except for its shape.

It looked like a small child holding a stuffed teddy bear.

The little child was seated on the ground, hugging the bear and... sobbing.

"Don't go..."

"...please."

"Please don't leave me."

"Don't go..."

The sound of a little girl sobbing, repeating the same words over and over.

Her voice seemed to come from everywhere, just like Ragnar's.

Wherever the fog was, the voice was too.

"Don't go."

"!?"

Just like before, he suddenly heard the girl whispering behind his ear.

He didn't dare turn around this time.

Gripping Void Eater so tight his knuckles turned white.

'Don't look away... don't look away... Damn it, how many minutes have passed!?'

"Don't go." "Don't go." "Don't go." "Don't go." "Don't go." "Don't go."

Chapter 9: The Crying Fog
"Lord Ragnar, we have lost visual and audio from the drone. However, the other sensors are still active," the operator informed as Ragnar and Thomas's eyes remained fixed on the holographic screen, which was currently only showing black.

"How long will it take for the nearest drone to reach his location?" Ragnar asked.

"It would take at least 20 minutes for the nearest drone to arrive at his location, my lord."

A frown appeared on Ragnar's face.

'Saint Solomon would reach there before that time... I need to see what is happening.'

"Are there any active soldiers currently in Paris?"

The operator merely shook his head in response to Ragnar's question, making him scowl in annoyance.

He was already starting to lean towards the possibility that it really was Azriel instead of a skinwalker.

No, he was sure of it—it really was Azriel.

'No matter how Saint Solomon is, he wouldn't act this carefree, not with how much he favors Azriel.'

Ragnar grit his teeth as he waited for the drone to show footage again.

"It was spotted at the border of Germany and France a month ago by Major Hendricks," another operator informed.

The void creature that attacked Azriel was well-known in France.

Or perhaps the reason the void creature was so well-known was because nothing was known about it at all.

"The Crying Fog..."

An operator handed a file to Thomas, who then handed it to Ragnar.

----------------------------------------------

Void Creature #1247

Name: The Crying Fog

Rank: Unknown

Type: Unknown

First Seen: 26 April 2144

Last Seen: 14 September 2148

Victims: 86 active soldiers gone missing, among them being Captain Harold, a Grade 1 Expert.

Description: The Crying Fog, an unknown void creature, was first spotted in France 4 years ago. It is unknown from what phase void rift it came from. Its true form is still unknown, whether the void creature is the fog itself or the fog is just one of its abilities. The void creature has never left France.

It is reported that the sound of a sobbing little girl always resounds inside and outside of the fog range before the victims go missing.

----------------------------------------------

'...How did it get to Paris so quickly without anyone noticing?'

Ragnar thought, reading the information they had on the void creature.

Which was basically nothing.

The void creature barely showed itself, but whenever it did, the person encountering it would go missing after the fog disappeared.

Only twice had they seen the fog through a drone before losing connection.

'This marks the third time we have gotten footage of it... we need to update the file, huh?'

'Azriel... will Saint Solomon make it in time?'

Perhaps noticing Ragnar's emotions, Thomas spoke softly.

"If he truly did survive for the past 2 years in the void realm, then I doubt that this will be enough to take him down... probably."

Ragnar merely hummed in response to Thomas's attempt to cheer him up.

'I really hope he is right...'

There was no mention of this void creature ever in the book, meaning that the protagonist never had to face this creature before.

Or perhaps he did, but in the later half.

Azriel knew that, at least in the first half, the protagonist didn't go to Europe.

But the system did, a few times, send him to the void realm with its mysterious powers for a few quests.

'Calm down...'

Azriel's eyes never left the silhouette of the sobbing girl.

Not even once did he blink as his eyes were fixed, wide-eyed, on her—or it.

The void creature he was facing was perhaps the most dreadful type you could encounter.

It didn't attack physically; instead, it attacked mentally.

The worst type of attacks one could encounter in battle are, after all, mental attacks.

The constant whispers of the void creatures were enough to almost make Azriel scream.

His eyes were hurting as he didn't dare to look away or blink for even a second.

His right shoulder was stinging with unbearable pain from his previous fight.

His body and mind were so tired that he felt like he could collapse if he relaxed even for a single second.

"Please... don't go"

"Please don't leave me..."

"I don't want to be alone anymore..."

"Don't go..."

Azriel kept hearing the constant, silent pleas of the girl everywhere.

'P-please, dammit... just shut up, please.'

Azriel murmured.

He was scared.

Not because of her sobbing.

No.

He was scared of himself.

The fuzzy feeling that was silently rising in his chest. He felt compelled to walk over to the girl's silhouette and soothe her, to tell her it was okay, that he wouldn't leave her.

To never let go of her...

Azriel was so afraid that he didn't even dare to breathe. The cold fog that was touching his skin felt like torture.

'Don't go, dammit, don't fucking move!'

Screaming inside his mind, he kept staring at the dark silhouette. He could feel his knees starting to become numb.

"Don't go... Don't go... Don't go... Don't go..."

And then, when he almost gave in to exhaustion...

The sobbing whispers stopped. It felt like the world was suddenly frozen in time. There was no sound anymore coming from anywhere.

The dark silhouette disappeared into the fog, making him exhale the breath he was holding. Azriel fell to his knees, unable to stand any longer.

'Thank God...'

He felt tired. So tired.

Closing his eyes, Azriel tried to stabilize his breathing as his heart was still beating like crazy.

"Good job, Azriel. You managed to survive. The fog has disappeared with the creature. Open your eyes now. Saint Solomon should be here in 15 minutes."

Hearing Ragnar's clear voice next to him felt so comforting right now.

"Y-yeah, thanks."

Just when Azriel was about to do what he said and open his eyes...

He froze.

Ragnar's voice didn't sound at all like a girl sobbing and whispering. It even came from a single direction that was right next to his face.

His voice was instead clear as day, and Azriel could feel his breath against his face.

"!?"

Azriel clenched his eyes tighter shut, not daring to open them in the slightest. Something was wrong... terribly wrong.

Why would he hear Ragnar's voice so clearly? Why could he feel his breath against his face?

And...

'15 m-minutes? T-that is impossible...'

He was sure that more than enough time had already passed unless the fog or the void creature had an ability to actually freeze time, which he highly doubted.

"Azriel Crimson? What is it? Open your eyes. Saint Solomon will be here in 15 minutes."

Azriel shuddered each time he felt the cold breath of whatever was next to him speaking calmly to him.

'Don't open them! Don't open them! No matter what!'

"Azriel... Crimson... open your eyes... open... eyes."

The voice next to him didn't sound like Ragnar anymore. It became distorted and sounded like glass scraping against his ears. Gritting his teeth, he kept clenching his eyes shut, trying to ignore the harrowing voice next to him.

"Open, open, open, open!"

"OPEN YOUR EYES! OPEN YOUR EYES! OPEN YOUR EYES!"

The voice became louder and louder, screaming, making his ears literally bleed. It didn't sound human at all—no human was capable of producing such harrowing sounds in the slightest.

"Open... eyes... Saint... Solomon... 15 minutes."

Seconds kept passing, feeling like an eternity, until Azriel felt the inhuman shrieks growing more distant. The cold breath didn't touch his face anymore, making him release the breath he was holding.

Still, Azriel didn't dare to open his eyes.

Until...

"Brother."

"...Huh?"

He heard a familiar voice speak further ahead of him. Despite everything that he just went through, his eyes opened before he could think about what he was doing.

Chapter 10: Don’t go...
"Ah..."

A weak, barely audible sound escaped Azriel's lips as he gazed at the figure standing in front of him.

A girl...

A young girl, no older than nine, with beautiful, long brown hair cascading down to her waist. Her emerald eyes, which once sparkled like stars in the vast night sky, had lost their shine. Blood stains covered her face and clothes.

"L-Lia..."

Void Eater slipped through his fingers, dropping to the ground. Strangely enough, the moment Void Eater touched the ground, it didn't make any sound.

Standing in front of Azriel was his little sister...

Lia Karumi.

He would have given anything to see her one more time, to see that big smile on her face again. The moments where they bickered with each other about who would sit in front of the car, the times when he helped her with her studies.

Seeing his little sister in front of him again, Azriel was paralyzed, unable to move a muscle.

Deep down, he knew... He knew that the girl in front of him wasn't his little sister but the void creature.

Yet even then... it didn't matter to him. The person he wished to see the most was in front of him again.

His mouth kept opening and closing repeatedly.

He couldn't find the right words to say to her. He wanted to apologize to her so badly.

That if only he was there, he might have changed the outcome of that accident.

That if only he had told them to stay at home.

That if only he had done anything different that day, she would still be alive.

That if only he didn't have a fight with them that day...

"Brother, why did you leave me?"

Azriel's eyes trembled as he gazed at her. Her voice was exactly as he still remembered it to be.

"I..."

He couldn't say anything. His words got stuck in his throat. Tears started streaming down her face as her sobbing could be heard.

"Why... why did you leave me?"

"Why did you let me die?"

"You were my brother, but you killed me..."

"You pushed us away and killed us!"

She screamed at Azriel, making him bite his bottom lip, tasting iron.

"Lia..."

His voice cracked as he tried to say her name.

"I-I'm sorry.... I swear."

Azriel's voice became hoarse as his vision got blurry, yet he never stopped looking at his little sister.

"I am so sorry... I would do anything to change what happened."

"Please... please believe me."

"I never hated you... nor Mom and Dad, I swear."

His voice trembled with each word he spoke, tears streaming down his eyes.

His eyes were stinging so much, yet he didn't even blink once.

"Liar!"

"Brother is a liar!"

"You hate us! You told us that yourself!"

She kept screaming at him. His heart felt like it was stabbed by a knife, only for the knife to twist over and over again.

"N-no... I swear I didn't. I swear I never hated you, Lia!"

"I never hated you or Mom and Dad!"

"I would do anything! Anything to go back and save you and Mom and Dad!"

"I swear I am so sorry! Not a day goes by where I don't regret when you died!"

"I-if I could, I would trade my life for yours and Mom and Dad's."

Azriel's voice got louder with each word as he tried to convince her.

"Please believe me..."

he murmured silently in the end.

"Then..."

"Don't leave us anymore, Brother."

"Huh?"

She started walking slowly towards Azriel until she was close enough for him to stretch his arm out and grab her if he wanted to.

"Don't abandon me, Brother."

"Stay with me—with us."

"Don't leave us anymore..."

Her voice started to distort at the end, yet her appearance never changed. Suddenly, he caught a glimpse from behind her.

Azriel could see people a little bit behind her, all facing him, yet there were no heads on them... It was like someone or something tore them off.

They were all standing there wearing typical black military uniforms.

Strangely, Azriel didn't feel anything gazing at them as his eyes met those of Lia again. As if it was a mere dream, he already forgot about those soldiers behind her.

She stretched her small, delicate hand in front of Azriel with a small smile on her face.

"Join us..."

"Brother."

"We can be together again."

"You, me, Mom and Dad—all of us again, a happy family."

"All you have to do is accept me..."

"We will be together for all of eternity, I promise."

Her voice was again the normal one he always remembered it to be. Slowly, he raised his right hand towards hers.

'Can I really be with her again?'

'Does that mean she forgives me...?'

'If I joined her, would that mean we can be together again?'

'As a family again? With Mom and Dad sitting at the same table, eating together?'

Hope started filling his broken heart as he raised his hand until it was mere inches from touching hers. For a second, he hesitated for some odd reason. He didn't know why, but he felt something was odd. But...

In the end, he merely shook his head.

'Right... she is my little sister. Of course, I should be with her.'

Saying that, he was about to grasp her small hand again. A small smile appeared on his face, but then...

She was gone.

The fog was gone.

Everything around him was suddenly gone.

The buildings, the debris, the abandoned cars, and the bodies of the four void wolves.

All of them were gone, consumed by the fog.

Appearing out of nowhere just to disappear the same way. The only thing left was Void Eater on the ground next to him, and in front of him, he could see the tall monument gazing down at him.

Realizing what had just happened, his heart trembled.

"Lia... no."

"Please..."

"Don't go..."

Chapter 11: Treacherous
"Tch, it ran away. What a scaredy cat..."

Solomon muttered bitterly as he walked slowly forward. A little farther from him, Azriel was kneeling on the ground, gazing at the monument that once stood as one of humanity's greatest achievements.

Perhaps it not having fallen yet, despite everything that lurks around, stands as proof that humanity hasn't either—a beacon of hope.

Solomon would have chased the creature by now, but that wasn't his priority currently.

No.

His priority right now was the kneeling boy in front of him.

The wind howled, making the boy's obsidian black hair flutter.

'It really is him... to think he was alive all this time,' Solomon thought.

He already had a grasp of the situation that had happened here.

He had felt the sudden spike of mana at Azriel's location and tried to get there as fast as possible.

Solomon was scared that he was too late and Azriel had actually died.

'That creature... it was at least an Abyssal-ranked.'

Stopping a little further away from Azriel, he gazed at his back.

He felt like if the wind was only a little bit stronger, Azriel might blow away.

'I wonder what he saw...'

He wouldn't comfort Azriel, though, no matter what.

Not the person he believed to have survived the void realm all on his own.

Not the one who is the son of the Crimson clan.

Not the one he had such high hopes for.

After an entire minute, Azriel spoke without turning around.

"If you had arrived even a second later, I would have died. Thanks."

"So, the prince has learned how to be appreciative."

"You learn a thing or two when you spend basically a lifetime in another world," Azriel replied, chuckling, before finally standing up and turning around.

"Ha! You look like a homeless person, though I suppose even then you look just as charming."

Solomon said this while scanning Azriel's entire body, ignoring the twitch of Azriel's lips and his cautious glare.

'Certainly, he has become more handsome over the years... hmm?' he thought, glancing at Azriel's frozen shoulder.

"Oh, did you lose your space ring in the void realm?"

Azriel shrugged his shoulders. "Something like that..."

"Right, right, take this here."

Saying that, Solomon tossed a small vial filled with a shimmering, emerald liquid towards Azriel, seemingly taking it out of nowhere.

"Woah!"

Luckily, Azriel managed to catch it in time before it hit the ground.

"Dammit, careful there! You know how expensive these are!" Azriel scowled, making Solomon burst out in laughter.

"Hahahaha! Oh man, since when did you become so sensitive about money?"

"Huh? What are you yapping about? I've always been cautious when it comes to money."

"Pfft! Sure, sure. Just go and drink that healing potion. Your wound isn't that serious, so this should be enough."

"Dammit..."

Azriel cursed silently but still complied, making Solomon more amused.

'Hehe, he's become much livelier than before.'

'Though I wonder what he saw to make him cry...,' Solomon thought, glancing at the tear marks on Azriel's face.

'Well, not my business unless he decides to tell me.'

Thinking that, he finally started walking towards him.

*****

'Dammit, this guy always gets on my nerves!'

Solomon kept walking around Azriel like he was some animal in a zoo.

A sigh escaped Azriel's lips.

'At least my mind isn't so focused on what just happened...'

'I really have to strengthen my mind, making sure nothing like this ever happens again.'

Resolving to himself, he decided to finally speak to Solomon, who was eyeing him in a way that made his entire body shudder.

'Fucking creep!'

"What are you doing?"

"Hmm? Oh, me? Nothing really, just curious about the boy who managed to survive two whole years in the void world. So, how did you do it?"

'Actually, instead of the void realm, I was on an alternate Earth as Leo Karumi for the past 17 years before I inhabited this body and inherited everything from the previous Azriel Crimson,' Azriel thought.

Shrugging his shoulders, Azriel responded, "How else? I just ran away each time I saw a void creature and hid myself in places they didn't go."

He lied.

He couldn't really tell all of that to Solomon unless he was planning to be called someone crazier than him.

But that doesn't matter.

If there is one thing he was good at, it was lying. He would lie without a second thought if it benefited him.

As treacherous as he might be, Azriel could lie just as easily as he could breathe.

Besides, he could easily lie his way out of this, deceiving everyone.

He had something fundamental that no one else did in this world:

knowledge.

If they would ask him to be more specific, he could easily describe a place the protagonist will be sent by the system.

"Ran away and hid yourself, huh? Sure, but I doubt that was all there was to it. That wouldn't explain how you are so... strong now," Solomon said, his eyes practically sparkling as his crimson eyes, the same as Azriel's, met his.

"You're thinking too deeply about it. I only killed those that I could kill for food and collected their mana cores at the same time. It's only natural that surviving in such an environment would help me get stronger."

"Hmm, right, right. And so? What rank and grade are you now?"

For a second, Azriel didn't respond, but in the end, he shook his head since there was no point hiding it from Solomon.

"I am a Grade 3 Intermediate now."

The moment he said that, he felt a shift in the air as a predatory smile suddenly appeared on Solomon's face. The ground beneath him trembled as well for a few seconds.

'This fucking maniac!'

"Ha! To become a Grade 3 Intermediate in such a short amount of time just by surviving in the void realm for two years! What would happen if you received actual proper training and spent more time in the void realm..."

Murmuring the last part to himself, Solomon looked him dead in the eye.

"Say, Azriel, how about you and I ditch everyone and go live in the void realm for another five years or so, huh? You're already used to it, no?"

Azriel's mind halted for a second, hearing the words leaving Solomon's lips.

'H-he is for real... this lunatic is actually being for real...'

"H-haha, you really have a way with jokes... We should probably head out since Uncle Ragnar must be worried since the drone has been consumed by that weird void creature," Azriel said awkwardly as Solomon merely clicked his tongue.
