Zhou Li answered with a smile, “Speak little and you won’t pick up idle anger; quiet cultivation lengthens one’s years. The sharper point is how one deals with others — it’s not about the thrill of a sudden acquaintance, but whether one grows weary of long association.”

Farther out at Yuanyang Islet, the girl nicknamed Ruifeng’er couldn’t help but ask again, “Sister Tuoyan, who is that man? Why do you seem so afraid of him? You clearly know him — why hide from him?”

Madame Tuoyan, a little way from the blue-robed figure, laughed, “Afraid of him? What a joke.”

The girl suddenly realized, “Sister Tuoyan — could it be that you like him?!”

Madame Tuoyan was stunned, quickly clapped a hand over the silly girl’s mouth. “Don’t say such things!”

If that fellow heard it, she’d at the very least have to pay for another whole plum-garden as compensation.

Like him? That didn’t mean she’d go ask the smiling, cold-blooded Hidden Lord for a duel of fists and blades, did it?

One slip and she might be beaten or set up to die.

By the river, Chen Ping’an hooked another golden carp and dropped it into the basket.

Both groups glanced over.

Not because anyone coveted the carp.

They were taking the chance to look the young blue-robed guest over again.

He’d called Madame Gui “Auntie Gui” unprompted.

He’d even received praise from the famous Gu Qingsong: “Kid, you’ve promise — I guessed right, won’t lecture you.” It sounded like the tone an elder on the mountain might take with a favored junior.

He had also nodded to He Xiaoliang from Beijulu Prefecture with a plain “Master He.”

If they weren’t mistaken, He Xiaoliang had a faint smile — not quite matching the gossip that had circulated earlier in the mountain gazette.

He Xiaoliang, as a direct disciple of one of Baiyu Capital’s three presiding masters, was himself an Immortal Realm who could found a sect in Beijulu Prefecture. And yes, he was said to be very beautiful.

Rumor said she was single-minded in cultivation, uninterested in romantic entanglements; Xu Xuan, the only disciple of the great Northern-sword Immortal Bai Shang, was infatuated with her and pestered her so persistently that she finally beat him badly, shaming Bai Shang and leading to a deep feud between their sects. Bai Shang supposedly declared she’d never reach Ascension.

Men and women both gave He Xiaoliang extra glances. Men thought her otherworldly — to pair with such a woman as a mountain Dao companion would be an envy-inducing match. Women looked and felt their own beauty slightly diminished by comparison.

In any case, both groups couldn’t help thinking higher of that young angler who knew so many great cultivators.

Li Baopin said, “Little Junior Uncle, Sister He looks just as young as when I first met her — maybe even prettier?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “I didn’t notice.”

He’d only been thinking, quite unbidden, of the women from his own Falling-Apart Mountain: diligent Cen Yuanji and the sharp-edged Yuanbao. Those two female martial artists were not young anymore either, and still unmarried. As women, they’d not worry about marriage; a few crow’s-feet won’t stop men admiring them. On their mountain, no one was plain or ugly — Zhu Xian, Jiang Shangzhen, Mi Yu, Cui Dongshan, Cao Qinglang, Yuan Lai… and that’s without counting Lord Wei and the guest elders. Swordsmanship, boxing, qin, chess, calligraphy, makeup — what couldn’t they do? If only their mountain chief weren’t so particular about money, once word spread, the immortals of Baoping Isle would flood Falling-Apart Mountain with coin like a dam break.

Female martial artists who enter the Qi-refining realm not only temper their bodies but nourish their spirits; the effects are evident. When they reach the Golden-body realm there are further gains. Take Yellow-Cloth Yun from Pushan on Tongye Isle — she’s not young, yet doesn’t look it.

Back home, Yuanlai had long liked Cen Yuanji; Yuanbao secretly admired Cao Qinglang — Chen Ping’an had heard that on his return.

Even Little Millet had tattled privately to their kindly mountain chief: each time Cao Qinglang was present, the big Yuanbao would speak loud and act tough, intentionally avoiding looking at Cao Qinglang — who were they fooling? Eyes may not look, but the heart is full of Cao Qinglang.

So maybe Yuanbao alone thought it was love, and only she knew.

Li Baopin asked with a grin, “Little Junior Uncle, are you thinking about happy things?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Thinking about how to earn money for the mountain.”

Li Baopin remembered something. “I heard there’s a big package shop over at Yuanyang Islet that does good business. If you have time, we should go look.”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “If we have time, we’ll go. And we should bring Li Huai.”

He took from his sleeve a yellow paper talisman, traced its core with his hand; it flashed, and the talisman folded into a little yellow paper crane that fluttered away.

It flew to Wencheng County to fetch Li Huai, asking him to hurry over to meet them at Yuanyang Islet.

The elderly man who had been sitting cross-legged opened his eyes again and, seeing the yellow crane go off, made an odd sound — surprised that the messenger talisman belonged to a talisman practitioner with an earth-immortal air rather than a Golden-body martial man. Could it be a Pushan Ye clan youngster?

The lounger among the noble sons drank deeply, suddenly inspired, and laughed out a poem:

A yellow crane sings beyond the tower, the fishing rod puts down the sunset, wine dispels mountain-drunk sorrows, and one feels light enough to transform into wings and ascend.

Chen Ping’an thought: writing doggerel is best avoided; it cheers the writer and aches the listeners.

Li Baopin asked softly, “Little Junior Uncle, Pei Qian and Little Millet said you’re good at poetry?”

Chen Ping’an waved it off. “Not true; don’t listen to their nonsense.”

Li Baopin looked half-convinced.

Chen Ping’an used heart-speech to the flower-pinned youth: “Seen enough?”

The young man looked a little surprised, hesitated, then smiled, “What are you saying? I don’t understand.”

Chen Ping’an said, “I’m advising you to mind your eyes and keep your chest settled. On the mountain, it’s as much about the heart as it is about one’s conduct.”

The young man lifted a finger and idly adjusted the flower he’d pinned into his hair — a plum blossom from a life-master of the Hundred-Blossom Bliss, given by his sect’s founder, not something he could take credit for.

Chen Ping’an fell silent.

The young man leaned back and fixed his gaze on the red-clothed girl who’d caught his eye. If she weren’t an academy student, it would have been perfect.

He stayed in that pose and smiled at the blue-robed guest: “What, you glance a few times and you have to start killing and beating? Who are you?”

Chen Ping’an smiled and turned his head.

The man raised one hand and tapped his own neck, and with heart-speech laughed, “Come on, toss a talisman at me and pretend I begged you sincerely — how about it?”

Some provincial bumpkin who only knew Madame Gui and Gu Qingsong, and could barely say anything in front of Zhou Li and He Xiaoliang, actually thought he could swagger through Middle Land?

Li Baopin asked, “Little Junior Uncle, what’s wrong?”

Chen Ping’an set his rod down and smiled, “Someone asked me to strike him; I nearly died of fright.”

Not killed by Wenhai’s plotting, not cleft by a swordlord — who’d have thought he’d run into a top expert here?

Li Baopin blinked. “Raised on arsenic, huh.”

Chen Ping’an just smiled and said nothing.

Their exchange was not in heart-speech, so both groups heard it.

The flower-pinned youth spat, stretched lazily — then a saving flying sword shot out. It was caught with both hands by the blue-robed guest, who casually flung it into the river. A restraining charm was snatched mid-flight by the blue-robed guest’s hand; a handful of shaping power gathered in his palm.

As for the flower-pinned youth, the blue-robed guest appeared behind him, seized him by the neck, hoisted him high and threw him hard; the fellow flew like a lightning bolt toward the opposite bank, skidding and skipping across the water.

The blue-robed guest moved like a ghost, appearing on the far shore without a ripple of qi or disturbance, planted a foot squarely on the youth’s neck, booted him again so he skidded back across and returned to the original spot as precise as could be.

The old Yupu sword-immortal — a guest of the Miyun Xie clan — and the flower-pinned loser belonged to entirely different circles; the elder didn’t even know him. The old man could have kept aloof, yet he’d been the first to sense the wrongness and tried to intervene, thinking to block things to prevent a young man’s rash violence from getting out of hand — a death near the Wen Miao would not be a small matter. He’d launched a flying sword intending to stop the trouble and perhaps gain some incense-favor from the mountain; the moment he sent it out he felt it was wrong. Sure enough, the blue-robed guest closed his index and middle fingers together and casually tossed that flying sword into the river, the sword’s qi tugging on the elder’s mind and almost shaking his Dao-heart. The blue-robed guest’s move was measured — he left the elder plenty of face; that was generous.

If a Yupu sword-immortal had first drawn a sword, what then? Would that be a “question of sword”? Sword-cultivators aren’t given to many subtleties.

Luckily the other wasn’t a sword-cultivator.

So the “senior” who cared for his looks, hands tucked in his sleeves, smiling at the old man, made the elder immediately rise and clasp hands to apologize: “I accidentally offended you, Senior.”

The old sword-immortal was inwardly resentful and vexed. Back in his youth, even if he lacked realm or skill, he would have simply met such a challenge: why fear? Strike first and ask questions later.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “You’re overthinking, Senior. No offense taken. I heard you and Pu He are old friends; you went abroad with blades when you were young.”

The old sword-immortal gaped, then recovered and, moved, clasped hands and loudly said, “Sword-cultivator from Liuxia Isle, greetings to the Hidden Lord!”

He didn’t even give his name. In his youth he’d been a Jin Dan cultivator who didn’t dare shout in a tavern; his slaying of demons was negligible. It wasn’t shame to lack realm, but misfortune came with a certain loose-mouthed friend: Pu He had fallen in cultivation in recent years, becoming a wreck of a Nascent Soul, yet strutted around with pride, insulting the elder, calling him a useless old thing, claiming he and the last Hidden Lord were best buddies who once terrorized the Sword Qi Great Wall — and so on — which had driven the elder half mad with anger.

Then the elder blurted, “Hidden Lord, shall I go kill him? I’ll run if needed.”

Chen Ping’an was speechless. Indeed, a man who’d been to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping’an still didn’t fully realize one thing: wherever Sword-cultivators appear in Haoran World, he would never be just a disciple of the Wen Sheng line or the mountain chief of Falling-Apart Mountain. He would always be the Hidden Lord of the Sword Qi Great Wall — and he’d never lack wine.

Chapter 792 — Immortal Techniques

The old sword-immortal was baffled. “Hidden Lord, what’s this for?”

For the elegant Hidden Lord before him had quietly taken a supreme sword-form, and drawn a circle of golden sword-qi around them — clearly isolating a small world so their conversation could not be overheard.

That sword-art was so masterful that if the Hidden Lord were not an Immortal, the old sword-immortal would not believe it. Was the Hidden Lord choosing not to reveal his identity for the moment? Was that necessary? The elder didn’t want to be presumptuous toward a Hidden Lord.

Chen Ping’an said, “I appreciate your good intentions, Senior. I’ll settle this matter myself.”

He glanced at the flower-pinned lad who lay on the ground sleeping — his malnourished state and paper-thin body suggested someone who rode his sect’s name and his ancestor’s reputation for a showy life. If the young man’s trainers now came charging for justice, and they were willing to speak reason, well and good; if not, it’d only be a few more punches.

If, by mischance, a Ascension Realm grandmaster turned up, he could let his senior brother know — they weren’t far from the Wen Miao.

No doubt Li Huai and the Ascension-ranked escort by his side would be on their way soon.

The old sword-immortal, hearing “senior,” felt awkward — the title and the presumption that he was an ancient turtle half-terrified him; it was clumsy. The Hidden Lord’s words were too polite, so distant — as if he weren’t one of his own. This was a rare chance; he could not let it slip. Back in Liuxia Isle he’d thought about how to boast back at Pu He; he was ready. The elder mistook the young Hidden Lord’s silence for reluctance to get involved, and laughed: “No matter this kid’s name, he must have some backing to come here. Hidden Lord, don’t worry — I’ll give him a quiet slash, not enough to lop off his head.”

Chen Ping’an felt helpless: the Senior didn’t even know this flower-pinned fellow’s name or roots?

Of course Chen Ping’an didn’t want the old sword-immortal — who had close ties with the Miyun Xie clan — dragged into needless trouble.

The elder, seeing the young Hidden Lord say nothing, grew confident and told his plan: a light slash into the youth’s vital acupoints so the sword-qi would linger; delay a while and no Immortal could save him. Then he’d withdraw from Wen Miao territory, hide in Liuxia Isle for a few years, and before taking ship leave a friend would spread word that he’d long disliked that brat — so the Hidden Lord’s intervention would look like saving someone. The elder promised no humiliation to the Hidden Lord and assured he’d not be sullied by any unpleasantness; they were sword-cultivators after all, too entangled in grievances to brag over a simple intervention.

Sword-cultivators are the most intractable of mountain folk — with reason. Wherever they go, they make a living; if one place won’t keep them, another will. Even if nowhere kept them, a single swordsman could stand tall in the world.

On Baoping Isle, Li Tuanjing once held down Zhengyang Mountain for centuries; his Fenglei Garden was more than a sect in his time.

Chen Ping’an’s early impression of sword-cultivators like Liu Baqiao was not only their passion but their proud bearing; apart from matters of the heart, few things seemed burdensome. There was also Wei Jinxue in the Snow-Temple and Xie Shi the Celestial Lord across Beijulu Prefecture — they had asked for duels and left the world with panache.

When the spring-flag retreat on Daoxuan Mountain summoned cross-island ship captains, names like Xie Zhi, Song Ping, Pu He, Xie Songhua appeared — all men of decisive, unhesitating action. Pu He, though not a wild practitioner, behaved wilder than wild practitioners: he once threw a Nascent-Soul ship steward from his house, then sought out the ship’s master Li Xun and provoked rival masters until Li Xun, though backed by many, had to apologize to Pu He on his own turf.

That is the way of sword-cultivators: asking swords and answering swords are taken as perfectly natural.

Chen Ping’an had become a swordsman on the Sword Qi Great Wall; that identity lingered inside him like an unreturned self.

Meeting the old sword-immortal Yu Yue reminded him that Haoran sword-cultivators, especially after becoming sword-immortals, were very good at reasoning — though their logic often took odd forms. Like Yu Yue today: no fuss, strike first if needed.

Pu He and friends, whatever their secular stations, must make way for the word “swordsman.”

In Chen Ping’an’s view, Haoran sword-cultivators fell into three groups: those of the Sword Qi Great Wall, those of Beijulu Prefecture, and the rest. If only Haoran’s swordsman tradition is considered, they split into two: those who’d been to the Sword Qi Great Wall and those who hadn’t.

He shook his head with a smile. “No need at all.”

The elder had no chance to cut anyone, and felt a little disappointed. “Then I’ll follow the Hidden Lord’s lead and call this brat someone paying incense too highly.”

This old guest-of-the-Miyun-Xie clan was named Yu Yue, a solid Yupu-realm elder, a true old Yupu.

Yu Yue had two life-sword pieces, “Fright Bird” and “Hundred Flowers.” Once he’d clashed with an elder from Aiai Isle; his two flying swords had earned the reputation “a bird flashes like lightning, a hundred flowers fill rivers,” “sword-qi rushing, equal to the Southern Dipper.” When he’d earlier displayed a flying sword, it had been the famed speed-weapon “Fright Bird.”

For the past two centuries Yu Yue had served as a guest elder and the chief guest of the Miyun Xie family on Liuxia Isle. In Haoran World, sects prize even one or two sword-immortals as honors; especially on Aiai Isle, where they are rare.

A few years back the Liu family in Aiai Isle had worked hard to invite Xie Songhua as a guest elder — a prime example. The Liu house didn’t lack top-tier fighters; they kept many retainers. So hosting someone of Yu Yue’s caliber was a mark of prestige.

Chen Ping’an retracted the sword-array he’d learned from Cui Dongshan.

Both groups of anglers were low-realm, so they hadn’t heard the conversation between Chen Ping’an and the old sword-immortal; moreover, both men were inside the sword-array, so the scene was hazy and outsiders couldn’t make it out.

Yu Yue sincerely praised: “Hidden Lord, that sword-art you just showed was truly beautiful — it left one with nothing to say.”

Chen Ping’an felt shy to answer.

He’d learned. A “nothing to say” seemed the best kind of pause.

The summer-resort archives varied in their records of outside swordsmen. Yu Yue, who had been young once, appeared only briefly in the Sword Qi Great Wall’s files. The previous Hidden Lord’s sword-immortal Lu Shan had scribbled: “Yu Yue of Liuxia Isle, Jin Dan cultivator with two flying swords, bird and flower — status passable, battle record negligible.”

Except for Yu Yue, outsiders found this sudden incident surprising.

From the blue-robed guest’s unheralded action to the Miyun Xie guest-old Yupu sword-immortal’s failed attempt to save, then to the flower-pinned youth lying nearly dying — it had happened in a flash. The plum blossom pinned to his head was still intact and vivid. Yu Yue, somehow, seemed to have struck up a chat with that young-looking but foul-tempered “expert.” What they spoke of nobody knew, but Yu Yue kept clasping hands and smiling like he’d met a playful mountain elder.

The reclining, wine-drinking Xie noble jumped up and pounded his knee, loudly exclaiming, “Sudden and divine — divine!”

True mastery isn’t just about realm; a fight’s aesthetics — technique, flow, ethereal posture — that’s the real art. The Xie noble liked flashy, beautiful techniques with an immortal bearing. Yu Yue’s wholehearted strike won favor.

Yu Yue, awkward, continued silently to the young Hidden Lord by heart-speech, “Don’t bother with this kid. He’s empty-headed, truth be told, but not malicious.”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “I can see that.”

After all, they were fellow lovers of doggerel.

Among Yu Yue’s side, three noble surnames remained quietly on the sidelines. Only the Xuia’s Xie clan’s young woman — no relation to Zhu Mei, it seemed — lacked reserve. She didn’t use heart-speech and cheerfully asked the Xie youth, “Can you tell what realm he is?”

He answered with a grin, “Clearly not a lower Five Realms qi-refiner.”

The woman coquettishly rolled her eyes and then turned to the blue-robed man with curiosity. That poor fellow from the Nine-True Hall was at least a Jin Dan cultivator, the favored disciple of the Hall’s head; how did he end up like a squab, at others’ mercy?

In Middle Land, geniuses abound and youth ambitions run high. Mountain elders don’t mind fights among equals, but if elders bully juniors because of age and realm, that’s taboo. She thought the blue-robed guest looked young but acted ruthlessly; he probably wasn’t actually a child. Someone who could “banter” with old Yupu Yu Yue might be a few hundred years old Nascent Soul swordsman, or a Yupu elder with a youthful face who’d passed five hundred years — hard to guess.

The young swordsman from Lotus City who’d moved to act in defense looked particularly grave.

Once you wade into a mountain brawl, the aftershocks are endless. Had he known the other could ignore Yu Yue’s “Fright Bird” flying sword, he wouldn’t have acted rashly. But Lotus City and the Nine-True Hall of the Great Yuong dynasty are long-standing allies with frequent trade; in both sentiment and reason, someone should defend their friend.

The Mei Nunnery immortal with the treasure-sable was pale and trembled, asking, “Should I open Mirror-Flower and Water-Moon to stop him? What if he draws his sword and kills?”

A man from Lotus City sighed: “Don’t fan the flames. We must observe. Remember? When a sword-immortal kills, he cares little for rules or scruples.”

The Jin Dan sword-cultivator from Meishan nodded: “It does resemble the sword-array of Immortal Liu of Zhi Island.”

Liu’s specialty was using flying swords’ golden tassels to draw a thunder-pool enclosure. A qi-refiner trapped within would be suppressed by sword-qi; against an equal-realm swordsman it’s already hard enough, add a formation and it’s over. Could this “young” sword-immortal be from the same lineage as the chess-loving Immortal Liu? Or a reclusive old master from the Exiled-Immortals Mountain? If so, it would explain everything.

Chen Ping’an noted everyone’s subtle changes of expression. Often a person’s eyes and tiny facial shifts reveal more truth than their spoken words.

He glanced at an elderly, neat-faced man in the distance — a guest of the Yuzhou Qiu clan from Liuxia Isle — carving a stoneware box of small sculpting knives. He hadn’t been fishing but sculpting jade landscapes. After Chen Ping’an shaped a golden thunder-pool small realm with sword-qi, others’ spells and hearts collapsed at a touch; only this elder could reach into the thunder-pool without flinching, twisting his wrist so his carving blade moved with silk-like precision. Yet, with reserve, he soon ceased his “questioning-sword” attempt.

The elder noticed Chen Ping’an’s gaze and smiled slightly, then silently apologized through heart-speech: “Earlier breaking the formation was habit; please, Sword-Immortal, don’t mind. Afterwards I’ll present this nearly finished miniature landscape seal as penance.”

Chen Ping’an answered by heart-speech: “No reward for no service; don’t trouble yourself. A chance meeting of landscapes and people — light carving is enough.”

Traveling on the mountain, often you needn’t step back — one small sideways motion from another can make a single-plank bridge into a broad road.

The elder was surprised and nodded with a laugh: “Never thought a Sword-Immortal would also be a connoisseur of stone and metal. Pleased to meet you. I am Lin Qing, student of Yang Xuan.”

Chen Ping’an’s eyes brightened. He changed tack: “I’ll happily accept Lin’s miniature seal.”

He’d never heard of Lin Qing before, but Yang Xuan’s name thundered in Chen Ping’an’s mind. Yang Xuan hailed from Old Pit Blessed Land and liked to sign his proud works with the character “Xuan”; his pieces were priceless. Yang Xuan’s work for the Talisman School’s Old Pit Blessed Land was like the Cao family’s patterned-room carvings for Yun Cave Blessed Land. Each aided a place’s renown.

The cultural foundation of a sect isn’t built only on its founder’s realm or connections, but also on having a few Yang Xuans and patterned-Caos to draw wealth and reputation. Falling-Apart Mountain already had one and a half such figures: Pei Xiang of Lotus-Ford Blessed Land was half, and the other would be their law-bearing long-life keeper.

Chen Ping’an added, “If there’s an opportunity, I’d like to pay respects to Master Yang and shamelessly request a few jade mountain pieces to stabilize our house fengshui.”

He had read about Yang Xuan in a divine text bought at the Lingzhi Study on Inverted-Hang Mountain; the mention was brief but for a craftsman it was a great honor. The “Shan Hai Zhi” described Yang Xuan’s fox-badge seals as supreme, and even reproduced a tiny jade mountain piece via immortal techniques — his “eighteen grotto-heavens” were famed. Yang Xuan carved a thin-relief travel picture: high sky and sparse clouds, an itinerant recluse on a donkey, a porter following, pavilions peeking through greenery; under close inspection each eave’s inscriptions were minute and entire scenes nested within scenes, an artistry that opened hidden worlds. A real Yang Xuan piece would always fetch a good price — so cultivators didn’t lack money, they lacked the contacts to deal directly with Yang Xuan.

The talisman master of the Old Pit Blessed Land — soon to become a Heaven-Union elder and rise to the Fourteen Realms — controlled several blessed lands and made huge income. Yang Xuan, though only an artisan and a Nascent Soul in realm, was revered by the Talisman School; who would dare strong-arm him?

Power differs even among Ascension Realms; depth of base matters.

Lin Qing was astonished and agreed.

The elder, a guest of the Yuzhou Qiu clan, quietly advised the two Qiu scions by heart-speech: “Don’t act rashly. This man may not be a villain; maybe he has long-standing grudge with the Nine-True Hall. Observe from afar and avoid speaking casually.”

He added, “This sword-immortal — unknown true age — seems to admire my master. From his bearing, he’s likely the child of an imperial clan, like you two. No need to pick a quarrel for a petty reputation of the Nine-True Hall.”

Yu Yue and the Xie youth asked around and — making an exception to gossip — told the young Hidden Lord: “This fellow on the ground is Li Qingzhu — loves crabs, so they call him ‘Li Hundred-Crab.’ He’s one of the Nine-True Hall’s master's direct disciples. His cultivation talent is average, but he’s obliging and ingratiating; his teacher is probably like a tortoise’s belly to mung beans, so he’s spoiled and treated like a son; the top beam crooked, the lower beams follow.”

Chen Ping’an nodded and smiled. “Noted.”

He lightly kicked the flower-pinned youth on the head. “Wake up. It’s not dark yet — stop sleeping.”

The youth who’d been skidding across the water slowly opened his eyes and, seeing the ghostly blue-robed guest, went pale and scrambled back a few steps. He truly worried that if he stood he’d collapse again; better to lie and avoid more trouble. Good actor.

Chen Ping’an saw the slight movement at the youth’s sleeve — the young man had secretly moved to summon reinforcements with a private method. Chen Ping’an played along, pretending not to see and did nothing to stop him — he wanted to watch the expression.

A belly full of scheming needs a hardened heart of courage to back it up. When that brave ego is crushed utterly and left only bitter bile, a bad man often becomes far more honest.

Since the talisman had been sent to fetch his master, the youth soon sat up. Li Qingzhu quickly recovered his composure, adjusted the plum blossom in his hair, smoothed his robe. He was badly wounded; his qi-furnace and spirit were a mess — healing would cost time and money; without two or three years he’d not fully recover. The fellow was infuriatingly hateful.

He still smiled, “I’ll be richly repaid for today’s humiliation.”

Chen Ping’an put out a hand and with a smile said, “Hand it over.”

The master-disciple of the Nine-True Hall looked puzzled.

Chen Ping’an smiled: “Money and honor, it’s better not to talk feelings. We don’t share a relationship to be offended about — be sensible and hand over the travel-money. The right bribe often buys one’s life.”

The man’s eyes flamed; he laughed: “Bribe for my life? My master’s right here on Yuanyang Islet! I’m not afraid you have the life to take and none to spend.”

He was all bravado, rose slowly, dusted himself off, and with his other hand demanded, “Give it. Now it’s your turn.”

Chen Ping’an smiled: “Wearing plum blossoms is tacky. Headwear plum flowers — bad luck follows.”

Li Qingzhu grinned: “Fine. That’s learned talk. I’ll pass it on to the flower-master and tell her you said so.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Seems you haven’t learned. Can’t keep your mouth shut. Remember to follow through — tell the life-master flower spirit exactly what you said afterward.”

Li Qingzhu felt invincible — as if no one superior to him had ever walked the world. He believed himself well within rights: this fellow had attacked him. Mountain code values heart, not outward conduct? Who did he think he was — the Ritual Sage?!

To Gu Qingsong he was just a little kid. If you had real skill, why not cozy up to Fire-Dragon Immortal or the great sword-immortal? Go make friends with them!

Li Qingzhu glanced at the red-clothed woman, then looked away with a grin.
