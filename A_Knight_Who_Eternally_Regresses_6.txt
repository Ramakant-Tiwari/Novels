Enkrid looked at the soldier who suddenly approached and nodded. Had he really saved his life?
In truth, it was the soldier's luck that he survived such a risky situation. There had been many instances where the soldier had died in previous iterations of today. The goddess of fortune had just briefly visited him that dayon that moment.
"Do as you wish."
Replying indifferently, Enkrid turned and looked at Andrew and Mack.
"Thanks for the help," Mack said first, his gaze unusually friendly.
Andrew was even more respectful.
"I hope to see you again."
Enkrid had thought of him as an arrogant brat, but his attitude had changed. His gaze was now respectful. Enkrid pressed his palm against his aching side.
"If we're in the same battle, we'll see each other again. The flower of the battlefield is..."
"The infantry."
They used the infantry's motto as their farewell. Watching from the side, the reconnaissance platoon leader approached.
"Everyone is free to return. Wounded should go to the medical tent for treatment. Good job, everyone. And, well, never mind."
The recon platoon leader almost spoke to Enkrid about his achievements and rewards but decided against it.
'First, the report.'
He had done something unbelievable.
Who knew if the higher-ups would believe it? Talking about it now seemed premature.
"Alright then."
Feeling his side pain subsiding, Enkrid decided he didn't need treatment and began walking. It was time to return.
'I hope nothing happened.'
In the tall grass, he hadn't had time for such thoughts, but now returning to the camp, he wondered if his squad had behaved. Perhaps they had clashed with other soldiers. Or maybe fought among themselves. Something must have happened. They weren't called the Troublemaker Squad for nothing.
He was close to the camp when a loud clang filled the air, the sound of metal striking metal. His trained hearing, honed through lessons with Jaxon, pinpointed the source instantly. It was near the main camp.
Enkrid quickened his pace. As he neared the camp, he saw a crowd gathered.
In the center, he saw Rem holding an axe and Ragna wielding a sword.
Chapter 33: Target
The company commander, upon hearing the platoon leader's report, had a perplexed look in her emerald-green eyes.
"With just ten men?"
What happened with the other squads during the reconnaissance mission was all standard. The only noteworthy event was encountering an Azpen infantry reconnaissance unit in the plains, and instead of fighting, they parted ways at a distance.
It was natural for Azpen to deploy recon squads, so encountering them in the plains wasn't unusual. In fact, it was odd that they only encountered them once.
But what Enkrid's unit did was different.
The enemy had set up an ambush in the tall grass. The enemy was up to something. It was understandable to gather such information.
But infiltrating the enemy camp and setting it on fire with just ten soldiers?
'What kind of guys are they?'
Enkrid was at the center of all this just like with the previous assassin incident.
Wasn't Enkrid the squad leader wherever things went awry?
Should it just be seen as bad luck?
But to call it just bad luck, he was incredibly resilient. Not only did he survive, but he also managed to make significant contributions. Despite his mediocre skills, the outcomes of every incident was beyond expectations. Even during the assassin incident, it was thanks to that squad leader that the target was protected. What he did this time was even more remarkable. Infiltrating the enemy camp and gathering intelligence alone was worth a hundred rewards.
"Yes, that's what they said."
The platoon leader replied.
Out of the ten who infiltrated the enemy camp, only five returned, but they achieved unbelievable results. They weren't some elite unit trained by the Cyprus Brigade, but ten reconnaissance soldiers led by a low-ranking soldier.
The company commander found this intriguing.
'Enkrid, Enkrid.'
What kind of guy was he?
His skills were mediocre, yet how could he accomplish such feats?
It wasn't something to dwell on deeply.
'Luck.'
She simply thought it was luck.
If it wasn't luck, what else could it be?
Unless he memorized the enemy's positions as if he had entered the enemy commander's mind, it was even more implausible. A more plausible theory was that he was a spy trained by the Azpe, but that made no sense either.
What kind of idiot would train and send such a spy?
A mere squad leader with mediocre skills?
"Shall I summon the squad leader to confirm the facts?"
"If he's dumb enough to lie about this, he would have died long ago."
The company commander sat back and thought.
Let's assume Enkrid is just lucky. What is Azpen trying to do?
First, she needed to report this to the battalion commander. That was the protocol. She finished her thoughts and stood up.
"Where are you going?"
Who picked this idiot as a platoon leader?
The company commander pushed the fool aside and spoke.
"I'm going to the battalion commander's tent."
Reporting this was the top priority.
Rem was bored. There were no minor skirmishes, and nothing to do. Both armies were busy staring each other down from their respective positions. There were rumors within the unit that this war might end like this.
"Well, it makes sense. Winter is coming, and this plain battle won't end quickly, right? So they'll likely postpone it until next year."
Kraiss, with his keen hearing, spoke.
It wasn't his opinion but a conclusion drawn from circulating rumors. Rem didn't care what Kraiss said about such matters. Whether this battlefield repeated every year or Azpen and Naurillia were once on good terms.
What did it matter?
'So damn boring.'
He spent his time sharpening his axe blade and juggling it, but it didn't change the fact that he had nothing to do. Rem was bored out of his mind. Everyone else seemed to have something to do.
"Are you crazy? Asking that price for cigars? Do you have an arrowhead stuck in your head?"
Big Eyes was busy selling things. After battles, there would be a lull in profits, so he had to make a lot now. He was working hard.
"What? Arrowhead?"
Sometimes there were people who glared at Big Eyes' small stature. Rem took it as a minor hobby to intimidate such people. Just licking the freshly sharpened axe blade while staring at them did the trick.
In fact, he didn't sharpen the axe blade too finely. If it was sharp enough to cut a finger upon touch, the blade would easily break. Unless it had magic or a craftsman's touch, this was the correct way to handle it. So licking the axe blade didn't cut his tongue.
"Well, I did get hit on the helmet by an arrow in the last battle."
The guy quickly backed off.
"Cigars are hard to come by. So, how many do you need?"
Kraiss soon raised his voice. He looked every bit the merchant. The sly alley cat Jaxon preferred wandering outside to staying in the tent. The religious zealot was busy praying, banging his head on the ground with a gloomy face.
He kept muttering, 'God, give me answers.'
Watching him made one reluctant to get close. Just his actions screamed 'crazy fanatic.'
Why does he always act like that?
Finally, Ragna spent his time sleeping all day without a care.
How could he not be bored, repeating that all day?
Was it fun?
'It's so boring without the squad leader.'
Rem thought inwardly, grumbling.
Was the squad leader dead?
Recon missions were dangerous. Even though the squad leader had improved a lot, by Rem's standards, his skills were still embarrassing.
If he had died?
That would be quite a shame.
'Damn, did I get attached?'
From what he had seen, it was a pity to let him die. But it was laughable to follow him around and protect him.
What was he anyway?
Nothing. Just someone he met by chance and liked.
'Someone I liked?'
Now that he thought about it, such people were rare. How many such people had he met in his life?
He hoped he would come back alive but he wasn't anxious. He wasn't someone who would fall to a bunch of amateurs.
In the end, unable to stand the unchanging boredom, Rem decided he couldn't stay idle any longer. Whether the squad leader was dead or alive, he needed to solve this boredom.
"Do I want to kill you?"
Rem chose a simple solution. He kicked Ragna, who was lying idly. Ragna looked up at Rem, as if questioning what he was doing.
"Do you want to die?"
Ragna was serious.
"I'm bored. Let's have a fight."
There was no need for more words. Jaxon, who had just entered the tent, ignored them and walked by. The religious zealot was busy banging his head on the ground with a gloomy face as usual. Kraiss was absent. They agreed and stepped outside.
Clang.
Lightly clashing axe and sword to signal the start of the fight. They began to swing their weapons at each other.
Whoosh!
Rem's arm swung, and the axe struck fiercely. Ragna dodged the axe blade, twisting his body to thrust his sword. The sharp thrust, far more refined than what Enkrid had shown, targeted Rem's abdomen. Rem powered off his toes and leaped back.
Thunk.
A footprint was left where his foot had been. Anyone with a keen eye would have been amazed at the level of their exchange. Enkrid arrived just as their fight was reaching its peak.
"Kill him!"
A thrilled soldier shouted. A crowd had gathered to watch the two. Why was the Troublemaker Squad called the Troublemaker Squad?
It was because they were a collection of individuals with various issues.
Why did the unit keep such troublemakers?
It was, of course, due to their skills. With such skill on display, it was naturally a spectacle.
Bang!
As the sword and axe clashed, a cloud of dust rose around them.
Whizz!
Despite this, their eyes never left each other.
Ska-gak.
The axe blade seemed to fall from above, scraping the ground. Small stones flew as the axe blade scraped them. Ragna dodged the axe scraping the ground and brought his sword down from above.
Whoosh.
Even with eyes open, the sword's trajectory was invisible. The sword, which had been above, suddenly dropped to cut Rem's neck.
Bang!
Once again, the axe and sword clashed. Sparks flew from their weapons.
"Crazy."
The 4th Company's 2nd Squad Leader muttered.
It was clear that their level was several times higher than his. Several skilled soldiers stuck out their tongues. There were even some on the verge of reaching a higher level. They all felt the difference in skill. Of course, some tried to gauge the skill of the two.
'I can do that too.'
'If it were me, I'd have ended it already.'
These thoughts came from the misconception that what they were seeing was all there was. Enkrid stood still, eyes wide open. He didn't hear anything around him. At this moment, his eyes were solely focused on the movements of the two.
In his mind, he was concentrating on dealing with the axe and sword. Sweat dripped from the tip of Enkrid's nose. Just observing and concentrating made him sweat profusely. Sometimes, just watching could improve one's skills.
Although unintended, Enkrid realized what he needed to do at this moment.
'This method won't work.'
Everyone had their own suitable method. The same applied to learning swordsmanship and training the body. Enkrid had something others didn't.
The curse of repeating today.
The wall that endlessly appeared, as the ferryman without eyes had said. So, instead of ordinary training or practice, he had to choose a new method suited for it.
Watching the axe and sword of the two, an idea emerged in Enkrid's mind. Excitement and realization came quickly, but they cooled just as fast. Watching their spar, Enkrid had to admit he had never drawn out their full skills.
Neither Rem nor Ragna had shown this while sparring with him. It wasn't about strength or speed; their expressions revealed it.
Rem was smiling. He looked so excited. Ragna's expression was also lively. It was a face not easily seen.
How many times had he repeated today?
How many times had he faced death?
Despite that, he couldn't seriously compete with either of them at this moment. That was his position.
But he wasn't discouraged.
If he was going to give up at this point, he wouldn't have started in the first place. Instead, he found it interesting. He had a new goal.
'That expression.'
While watching the two, he vowed to make them wear that expression even when facing him. Enkrid was satisfied with that. He saw a new path and had the time to walk it. It was, without a doubt, truly enjoyable.
Tiririring.
As the axe and sword grazed each other, they produced a strange sound. Simultaneously, Rem and Ragna distanced themselves. Both were sweating heavily. Sweat trickled down Ragna's forehead.
Hoo-
Rem exhaled and grinned.
"For a guy who sleeps all the time, you're pretty good."
Ragna sneered at that.
"And where do you get off evaluating me, barbarian who only bullies the weak?"
Despite the sharp words, they both sheathed their weapons. They knew each other's condition well. Going further would mean fighting to the death. They both still had energy left, but now was not the time. It was a spar with some reserves.
While fighting, they noticed a familiar face among the spectators. It was their squad leader. It proved they were observant enough to spot familiar faces even while fighting.
"Here to watch? If you want to keep watching, play with me."
Rem's sudden comment scattered the spectators. Left among the dispersing crowd was only the shabby-looking Enkrid.
"You're back?"
Rem welcomed Enkrid. Ragna acknowledged him with a nod. The fight was over.
And Enkrid had returned safely.
Soon, Jaxon, running his hand through his disheveled red hair, came out, and Kraiss ran over when he saw the squad leader.
"Welcome back."
"Squad leader!"
"God has watched over you."
The religious squad member also acknowledged him.
In total, there were six of them—a squad that was originally meant to be ten men strong. Enkrid, now reunited with his squad, officially announced his return.
Chapter 34: Why Do You Go That Far?
"Is the reconnaissance I know different from the reconnaissance you know?" Rem asked, spinning his axe in his hand.
"What do you mean?"
"You look like you almost died and then came back."
"It's just a scratch on my side."
"If that's a scratch, then a cut must mean instant death, huh?" Rem laughed heartily.
This guy hadn't changed a bit, Well, how much could he change in just a few days?
For Enkrid, it had been months, but for them, it had been less than a week.
"I did almost die," Enkrid admitted, feeling the wound on his side.
In truth, he had experienced countless deaths, but he couldn't exactly say that.
"Let me see."
Jaxon approached and lifted Enkrid's shirt to inspect the wound. Enkrid turned to make it easier for him to see.
"What do you know about it?"
Rem grumbled, but Jaxon ignored him and examined the wound.
"It's nothing serious," Enkrid said.
"The bone isn't damaged, but don't underestimate a minor wound."
Jaxon advised. He was right.
"I've already applied ointment."
"That's good."
Jaxon nodded.
"Did you encounter the enemy during the reconnaissance?"
Big Eyes asked, looking at Enkrid's bedraggled appearance. His hair was greasy, his eyes were hollow from lack of rest after the battle, and he was covered in dirt and sweat from the march. They hadn't had proper food or rest during the mission, so it was no wonder he looked worn out.
'Was it just an encounter? We stirred up the enemy camp.'
There was no need to say too much, so Enkrid just nodded. Having watched Rem and Ragna's fight as soon as he arrived, he was drenched in sweat and feeling exhausted.
Right now, he needed to eat and rest.
"Got any food? And water?" he asked.
It was time to eat and rest. In truth, he wanted to swing his sword immediately, but he was aware of his physical limits. And given the enemy presence in the tall grass, it seemed this battle wouldn't end anytime soon. So, he needed to get his body in shape for the next fight.
"Go wash up. We'll prepare a royal feast for you," Rem joked with a smile.
Enkrid nodded and headed toward the nearby stream.
The infantry camp was placed here for a reason. The stream behind them provided drinking water and a place to wash. When he dipped his hands in the water, a chill ran up his arms.
'It's getting colder.'
The temperature was dropping. Enkrid splashed water on his face, then began to strip and wash off the blood, oil, sweat, and grime from his body.
'That guy...'
As he washed, the events of the mission replayed in his mind. The tall grass, the ambush, passing the flag, and finally the guy with the sword and torch.
'I feel like I'll meet him again.'
It was an unavoidable premonition.
'Is this the wall?'
The eyeless ferryman had spoken of an endless wall blocking his path. He wasn't worried. He would just overcome it. To be honest, he was actually looking forward to it. Not being able to fight that guy had left him feeling regretful.
Of course, if they fought, he would probably die, but he didn't want to avoid it. He wanted to fight him. Seeing that guy had sparked an intense competitive spirit within him. Sometimes, you meet someone you just want to beat, similar to falling in love at first sight, but quite the opposite.
Having cleaned up, he returned to find hot soup, bread, and even some well-grilled meat skewers waiting for him. It wasn't quite a royal feast, but it was a rare treat on the battlefield.
"Rabbit?"
Enkrid asked, looking at the meat. Rem proudly stepped forward.
"I personally prepared it."
"No, Rem, I caught it," Kraiss corrected with a glare.
"Thanks."
Enkrid sat down and devoured the food.
"Every time I see you, I think you eat really well," Rem commented.
"You need to eat well to have strength."
"You're the most unique person I've ever met."
Watching him eat, Rem crossed his arms and said something nonsensical. To hear such words from a guy who had a hobby of assaulting comrades...
"I don't want to hear that from you," Enkrid retorted.
Rem laughed again.
After that, the squad members went their separate ways. Jaxon left, saying he had business to attend to, and Kraiss went off to sell his wares.
The religious zealot started praying in one corner, while Rem spent his time idly outside the tent, probably making pointless jokes with passing soldiers.
Ragna, however, kept staring at Enkrid, making his presence felt.
"What?"
Enkrid asked, turning to look at him.
"Just looking," Ragna replied, half-lying down.
When Enkrid tilted his head in confusion, Ragna turned away, saying it was nothing. He seemed to have something to say but didn't push it further. Enkrid knew from leading the Troublemaker Squad that pressing now wouldn't get any answers.
In cases like this, it was better to wait. If it was important, Ragna would bring it up again. If not, it would just pass.
Having just returned from a mission, Enkrid was exempt from night watch and meal duties. He ate well and slept deeply. Jaxon's ointment worked wonders. The wound on his side healed quickly. A couple more days of rest would be enough. Even while resting, Enkrid didn't waste his time.
'I'll probably lose ten times out of ten.'
He sat and mentally swung his sword. First against Rem, then Ragna, then the enemy he met in the tall grass. He pondered and pondered. An old swordsman from a quiet coastal town had once told him,
"If you don't want to die by a blind sword, you have two options. One is to pray to the goddess of fortune with all your might."
The first was to rely on luck.
"The second is to think and think again."
If you fought and survived, that fight would become an asset, the old man had said. So, how do you fight and survive?
By pondering. By thinking. By considering.
Think endlessly about methods. If you face the enemy without any thoughts, then you have to rely entirely on luck. If you don't want that, think and ponder in advance.
'He was a good teacher.'
His advice had been perfect for Enkrid at the time. And it was still useful now. Enkrid thought and pondered.
How to win.
At the very least, how to avoid losing.
His desperate search for a way out was the essence of the Vallen Style Swordsmanship. Some called it a crude trick, but it was Enkrid's core technique. It included tricks, headbutts, the Three Sword Style, and techniques for throwing daggers or stones. Though seemingly absurd and futile, it worked well against first-time opponents or those with mediocre skills.
In his mind, Enkrid swung his sword. He assumed a thrusting position, then threw a stone. Pretending to draw his sword, he threw a throwing knife. Rem deflected them all with his axe, and Ragna dodged them with footwork. The enemy with the sword and torch ignored the flying stone and charged, stabbing his heart. Reality might differ from his imagination, but at least in his mind, they moved as he envisioned.
'Again.'
He thought endlessly. Enkrid spent the whole day doing this and fell asleep. When he lay down, he fell asleep immediately. After all, he had just completed a grueling mission and was exhausted.
The next morning, Kraiss brought breakfast. It was thin soup, salty dried meat, and dry bread.
"Are you on duty?"
"Yes, you slept well."
"I was tired."
Kraiss rolled his big eyes and asked,
"What happened? Tell me."
Kraiss, Big Eyes, was the information hub of the battlefield. Enkrid paused, thinking for a moment. He decided there was no need to keep it secret. It would be known soon enough, and it wasn't classified information.
However, he didn't go into too much detail, only mentioning the enemy ambush in the tall grass. Explaining in detail would have been too tedious.
"Damn. If they ambushed us, they're not planning to let us go. But does ambushing there even make sense?"
Big Eyes, knowing little about strategy, sometimes hit the mark.
'It doesn't make sense.'
If the recon route hadn't passed through there, they would have missed it entirely. Without his ability to repeat today, the reconnaissance squad might have been wiped out.
An ambush was a tactic to counter an attack but their forces weren't advancing toward the tall grass.
So it was pointless. Big Eyes had pointed that out.
"We don't know yet."
And that was the truth. He assumed the higher-ups had a plan.
But something was definitely happening. From the flag to the guy guarding it. The placement of their troops showed a clear intent to annihilate any approaching enemies.
Normally, they wouldn't deploy their troops that way. So, the conclusion was that the enemy was preparing something.
"Damn, I thought this would end soon."
"We'll probably get orders today or tomorrow."
Shortly after their trivial conversation, someone shouted outside.
"Move out! 4th Company, move out!"
It was the voice of the 4th Platoon Leader.
"Your leg's not injured, right?"
The man poked his head into Enkrid's tent.
"I heard you went through hell."
"Where did you hear that?"
"Rumors are all over. They say you're the hidden child of the goddess of fortune."
Since he attributed everything to luck, this reaction was natural.
"Then who's my dad?"
"Who knows."
The platoon leader chuckled at Enkrid's joke.
"You must be tired, but we need to move. The unit is heading east from the position."
With that, Enkrid stood up. East meant toward the tall grass.
Knowing about the ambush, they wouldn't charge into the grass.
"It feels like a fight is coming. The air has changed."
Rem suddenly appeared beside him.
"Does it?"
"Don't get cocky just because you've improved. Stay cautious."
Was this concern or a curse?
It wasn't just the 4th Company moving; the entire infantry battalion was relocating. Most of the infantry forces mobilized for this battle were moving.
A platoon had about forty men. So, roughly six hundred infantry were moving. With the sound of their footsteps, the infantry moved out.
There was no battle that day. They set up a temporary camp after relocating. They lit fires and took positions.
No sane commander would order a charge into the tall grass, so it seemed like they were positioning themselves to be prepared for any situation.
That night passed, and Enkrid's wound hardly bothered him anymore.
The next day, they were instructed to manage their own meals. The six squad members gathered and cooked stew in a pot.
"I caught a lizard on the way."
Jaxon added the drained lizard meat to the stew.
"What a commendable act."
Rem was genuinely pleased. Jaxon didn't respond. Rem growled, feeling ignored, but Jaxon paid no attention.
'They weirdly suit each other.'
One talked, and the other ignored him. It seemed to work. In the army, moving, eating, and resting were tasks in themselves.
During the whole move and meals, Enkrid felt a peculiar gaze. Someone was staring at him.
It was Ragna.
"You're wearing out my face," Enkrid remarked.
Ragna averted his gaze.
"It's nothing."
He clearly had something to say.
Though the atmosphere was tense, as if a battle could break out any moment, another day passed. In his spare time, Enkrid practiced what he had mentally rehearsed. Some things were easier than expected, others harder.
As he practiced with his sword from morning, Ragna approached and asked,
"Why do you go that far?"
It was a random question, but Enkrid understood it perfectly. People who couldn't speak properly weren't rare. Ragna wasn't eloquent. He spoke his mind bluntly. So, the listener had to interpret it well.
In this regard, Enkrid was suitable. He understood what Ragna meant.
Scratch.
Enkrid scratched his forehead with his finger.
Chapter 35: He Was Purely Happy
The members of the Troublemaker Squad all had strong personalities, but they all shared a common trait; they generally paid little attention to their surroundings. Among them, Ragna was particularly indifferent to others' opinions and didn't care much about his environment.
‘Living haphazardly, fighting haphazardly, and eating haphazardly.’
Living like that, he also slept a lot. Given his nature, Enkrid had been surprised when Ragna volunteered to join the reconnaissance mission.
Ragna volunteering to take on reconnaissance?
Had our lazy squad member changed?
No, that wasn't the case. Ragna was capricious and driven by whims. At that moment, he had been caught up in the atmosphere, but would likely back out within a day, maybe even half a day.
That’s why Enkrid hadn't sent him on the mission in the first place. There was a reason Enkrid handled most of the troublesome tasks in the Troublemaker Squad.
Ragna's personality was, in many ways, the opposite of Enkrid’s. Ragna lacked motivation, while Enkrid was the type to spend every spare moment practicing with his sword.
Of course, Ragna did occasionally practice with his sword. He would spar with Rem as Enkrid had seen when he returned, and he had his moments on the battlefield.
But each time, Ragna would mutter, "It wasn't intentional." Enkrid found it curious that Ragna showed interest in him now.
‘What’s this about?’
It was rare. Ragna would sometimes ask questions or make requests but he wasn't the type to spend days watching and formulating his questions.
Enkrid lowered the hand that had been scratching his forehead. Among the squad members, Rem was the most active, but even Rem only interacted with people up to a certain point. Up close, it was clear that he kept people at arm's length. In some ways, Rem was a more difficult type than a lazy person like Ragna.
Still, Rem spoke his mind. Ragna, on the other hand, rarely said what was necessary. This made Ragna’s question all the more intriguing. For a moment, Enkrid stared into Ragna’s eyes. A silent moment passed between them.
Enkrid looked away, as if playing a staring game, and raised his head. The cloudless sky stretched out above them. Recently, it had rained often, but now the sky was a clear, deep blue without a single cloud. It made him feel refreshed.
Looking at the sky, he stopped wondering why Ragna was asking, what his motives were, or whether his guess was correct. Enkrid decided to stop worrying.
Ragna had asked a question; he would answer it. Whether dealing with swords or people, he always gave his best.
‘Since when did I start worrying about this?’
He always gave his best, even though what he wanted was far away. He lived a life of constant yearning.
Ragna asked why he went to such lengths. He was likely referring to Enkrid’s constant sword practice. Or perhaps his diligent approach to everything. Or maybe he was asking about his refusal to give up despite his modest skills. So, Enkrid responded to the question with a question.
"What if I were good with a sword?"
Outside the makeshift camp, in a place with no shade, sunlight surrounded them as Ragna’s gaze remained on Enkrid’s face. Enkrid continued.
"If I were, what could I become? What could I achieve?"
Enkrid’s voice was smooth, like a well-crafted instrument. At least, that’s how it sounded to Ragna. It wasn't an excited voice, nor was it a discouraged one. It was like reading a fairy tale to a child, calm and unhurried.
"Right now, I swing my sword to survive, but I don't want to live like that."
With those words, Enkrid swung his sword. From top to bottom, vertically.
Swish.
The blade cut through the air, releasing its distinctive scent. The scent of iron mixed with the battlefield's smell tickled Ragna's nose. Enkrid continued his sword practice, ignoring Ragna’s presence.
He trained with his sword. From top to bottom. From bottom to top. Diagonally, then horizontally. He imagined a sparring partner, simulating binding their swords together and pulling before striking back.
Ragna watched his squad leader in silence. As a low-ranking soldier in the Kingdom of Naurillia, Ragna knew that the Troublemaker Squad leader’s skills were above average for his rank.
But he was not highly skilled either. If he entered the mercenary business, he would be slightly above average. A mid-level mercenary's skill was not impressive.
Ragna had once been deeply involved in the mercenary world and knew the skill levels well. He had an innate insight into swordsmanship, almost on par with Frog. He could gauge the squad leader’s skills and knew his limitations.
‘It’s already too late.’
His foundation was flawed. From the moment he picked up the sword, he should have focused on basics. A lack of talent had taken away his opportunities.
What about the current squad leader?
He was right. The desperation to survive, the techniques honed for that purpose, held him back.
Among the squad leader’s skills, only two were notable. One was what he learned from Rem, who, despite his bad luck, had decent skills. The other was the sudden improvement in thrusting. Apart from these two, his basics were lacking, and he relied on tricks.
That reliance on tricks was the problem. Ragna, exercising his insight, asked instead of explaining.
"If you become good with the sword, what will you do then?"
Enkrid stopped swinging his sword. Sweat trickled down his forehead, dripping off his chin to the ground. Sweat dropped onto the soil, quickly absorbing into the earth.
Sunlight, swords, wind, sky. Embracing it all, Enkrid spoke the dream he had repeated countless times.
"A knight, a knight who races to the end of the battlefield."
"Why?"
Ragna asked. To him, it was a natural question. Ragna saw the path. A path whose destination was clear without needing to experience it.
Would that path be enjoyable?
Even upon reaching the destination, there was nothing he wanted to do. He had no will to walk that path. Ragna was like that. He saw the path and the destination but he couldn't walk it, nor did he want to.
"Does wanting to become something need a reason?"
Enkrid asked in return.
It was a romance, a dream. His life and the days he had lived. It was also the dream of a boy who had been enchanted long ago.
How many times had he repeated that dream?
Wanting to become something did not need a reason. He didn’t plan on merely wanting it.
"I want to live according to what I believe is right. To wield my sword for the poor and sick, for honor, and for those I love."
What is a knight?
Just a killing machine adept at killing?
Knights were often referred to that way. A combat machine specialized in killing. But if the knights Enkrid dreamed of were just that, he wouldn't have wielded his sword all this time.
A knight was one who protected honor and faith, who expressed their will through their sword. A sword that upheld chivalry, which most no longer sought.
As he spoke, Enkrid thought of Crang.
Why did his words have power?
How did his words attract everyone?
Now he had a glimpse of the answer. It was because of sincerity and true intention. That was the foundation. So Enkrid spoke with all his heart.
To Ragna, it was a shock. Of course, he didn't show it outwardly, so Enkrid didn't know. Ragna asked himself a question.
If he wanted to live according to what he believed was right, why did he need a sword?
Without strength, it was difficult to realize what he believed in. His heart was always filled with emptiness. That was the source of his helplessness. But now, as he conversed with Enkrid, a different flame kindled in his heart, replacing the helplessness.
Holding the flame blossoming in his heart, Ragna pondered deeply. He sat on the plains, surrounded by grass.
What is a knight, and what is a sword?
The questions led to conclusions.
‘I won’t know unless I walk the path.’
He found the necessity to walk the path. Enkrid left him there and resumed his sword practice. Silence filled the space, with only the sword, the sky, and the wind moving. Though slightly distant, the noisy sounds of soldiers in the camp reached them, but otherwise, it was quiet. The silence didn’t last long.
"Do you want to learn swordsmanship?"
Ragna, staring blankly at a pointed stone on the ground, spoke. With a thrust, sweat scattered through the air. Enkrid stopped mid-thrust. Regulating his breath, he kept his eyes on the sword tip and replied.
"Yes."
His tone was simple and calm. He never missed an opportunity to learn. For Enkrid, it was natural. Ragna was surprised at himself for saying that.
‘Why did I?’
But he soon understood why. Partly, he wanted to show the struggling squad leader the right path. The other part was for himself.
‘If the squad leader is around.’
He found himself moving more actively. Watching Enkrid live his life stimulated him. Ragna needed that stimulation. Something to push him down the long and tedious path. The squad leader's presence was that stimulus. With him, even training would seem worthwhile. Seeing him improve brought new energy.
He sparred with the squad leader, tried to take his place on reconnaissance, and used Rem to loosen up.
It was rare. At least for Ragna.
What would happen if he taught the squad leader?
It was more selfish than selfless. Enkrid didn’t question the reason.
‘Why is he doing this?’
Ragna offered to teach him swordsmanship without being asked. Learning the Heart of the Beast from Rem had been possible only because he had pestered Rem. It was the same with Jaxon. Everything had happened because he had taken the initiative.
But this time was different. Ragna had watched him for days, asked a few questions, and then offered to teach him swordsmanship. It seemed like a good opportunity.
So, he didn’t want to question the reason.
When sparring, Ragna had never discussed swordsmanship beyond what was necessary. Enkrid was like a starving wolf regarding swordsmanship. During sparring, he asked countless questions and pushed harder, but Ragna avoided answering. But now, he was offering to teach.
"Then, first."
Ragna stood up, dusting off his pants, and hesitated. He seemed to be choosing his words carefully. Enkrid lowered the sword tip and waited calmly. As he waited, he recalled what Rem had said.
"Me teaching swordsmanship is a bit much."
Rem was good with both axes and swords. Enkrid had seen him cut and stab enemies with a sword many times.
"I swing by instinct. You can't teach that. You need to learn systematically."
It didn't seem like he was just reluctant to teach. Nor was he holding back out of selfishness. If that were the case, he wouldn’t have taught him the Heart of the Beast. Enkrid had accepted it then. As Enkrid pondered, Ragna spoke.
"The beast's innards, or whatever you learned from the barbarian."
...Heart of the Beast. How did that become the beast's innards?
Rem would have swung his axe if he heard that.
"And the thrust."
Ragna continued, looking Enkrid straight in the eyes.
"Other than that, you'll need to start over from scratch. Is that okay?"
Enkrid was momentarily confused.
"So you mean starting from the basics again. Can you do it?"
Ragna didn’t know any other way to teach and learn. Enkrid found it hard to agree for a moment.
"Why?"
The Vallen Style Mercenary Swordsmanship. Despite what others said, he thought it was a great technique and style.
"If you keep using that swordsmanship, you won't improve beyond your current level."
Ragna continued explaining. His examples were crude and explanations unclear, but Enkrid quickly understood.
The core was simple. His current state had clear limits. Even if he kept training, he could improve, but the progress would be slow, and he wouldn’t overcome his limits. When asked why, Ragna explained that he had learned too many miscellaneous techniques.
"The main issue is the lack of basics."
Enkrid hadn’t expected to hear that. Even when he paid for lessons, instructors always emphasized the importance of basics, so he had invested a lot of time in them.
Thinking it over, it made sense. He always paid for lessons. He couldn’t spend that time on basics. So, he practiced what he thought were the basics— cutting and thrusting— on his own.
That was the problem.
A brief realization struck him. A moment of joy spread through his body. His hand holding the sword trembled. He saw a path.
A crude but open path beyond the wall and darkness that had always blocked his way. The exhilaration of that moment was unmatched.
As his hand trembled, Ragna spoke in a cautious tone.
"Now, you need to decide. Will you start anew, or will you be satisfied with where you are?"
Ragna expected Enkrid to give up. Starting anew meant beginning from the ground up. His mercenary skills, which were about mid-high level, would drop to the lower level.
Could he endure that?
Could someone who lived and breathed the battlefield?
Unless he had multiple lives. Even if he wanted to, it wouldn't be easy. When death loomed, instinctive skills would surface.
"You'll need to risk a few lives."
Ragna said, his tone rough but caring. Enkrid nodded. Ragna, confused by the vague gesture, looked at him, prompting Enkrid to clarify.
"I'll start anew."
"Really?"
Ragna was surprised by his answer. There was no hesitation in his response. Despite trembling moments before. Ragna thought it was out of anger, frustration, or despair. Enkrid's reaction was the opposite.
"Yes."
He was purely happy.
Chapter 36: The Fog of Annihilation
Ragna felt confused but quickly stopped thinking about it.
‘He was always strange.’
From his perspective, Enkrid was far from normal.
"In that case, do I start now?" Enkrid asked.
"Yes," Ragna replied.
Under the clear sky, they began anew, starting with how to hold the sword. No, they began with finding the right weapon.
"Since you have good strength, there's no reason to use a light weapon. Switching to a heavier longsword would be better. Let's trade."
Ragna handed over the sword at his waist. Enkrid thought it was a drastic suggestion. Who easily gives up a weapon they've gotten used to?
"I haven't used it long enough to get attached," Ragna added.
It wasn’t a particularly good sword, Enkrid realized. His own seemed better, but he agreed. The person teaching him was Ragna. He decided to follow his advice.
"Got it."
He switched from an arming sword to a longsword. The longer grip allowed for two-handed use, the blade was a handspan longer, and it weighed more. Though not a top-quality sword, the balance and finish were decent.
"Right hand in front, left hand behind."
After switching swords, they began with the basics of grip. Enkrid immersed himself completely in it. Ragna felt the same way. Teaching Enkrid was stimulating; he too got engrossed. They spent the entire morning this way, unaware of the time passing until they were interrupted.
"Skipping meals to play like kids, what are you doing?"
Rem arrived, making Enkrid aware of the time.
"Come to think of it, I'm hungry," Ragna muttered.
"You bastard, are you bothering our squad leader?"
"Screw off, barbarian."
"You're the one who should screw off, lazy bum."
The two bickered. Enkrid, drenched in sweat, let his sword hang. He was quite exhausted. Starting over wasn't easy.
‘There’s not enough time.’
There simply wasn't enough time. Initially, he planned to learn techniques efficiently, expecting his skills to improve since he could repeat today.
‘It’s the exact opposite.’
He hadn’t realized his basics were lacking. And he realized something else. Building basics under the watchful eye of a skilled swordsman was vastly different from doing it alone.
"Why did you position your feet that way?"
"You're gripping too loosely."
"Are you trying to thrust or slash?"
"What are you trying to do?"
"This won't work. Let's start with proper walking."
Ragna's criticisms rained down like a storm. Each piece of advice became a valuable asset. While bickering with Rem, Ragna suddenly asked Enkrid.
"But don't you want to improve your sword skills just to show off?"
Ragna remembered why he had picked up a sword as a child. Who wouldn’t want to stand out and be recognized?
Enkrid naturally had ambition and a competitive spirit. Among his fantasies was receiving a handkerchief from a lady he was protecting.
Who wouldn’t want that?
Everyone had a desire to be acknowledged.
"Of course, I want to show off. A lot," Enkrid admitted. He wanted to be cheered by people and be the hero of a minstrel’s song. It was only natural.
Ragna nodded. That seemed to answer his question.
"What are you saying? Anyway, assemble. The enemy has been spotted," Rem announced.
It was time for battle again. Enkrid nodded. Seeing this, Ragna thought he had made a mistake.
‘Will he survive today?’
If Enkrid went into battle like this, what would happen?
Unfamiliar with his new sword, his skills were clumsy and awkward. It was the sword he had honed today. He expected Enkrid to die.
‘He has no talent.’
Building basics had shown Ragna how poor Enkrid's skills were. It wasn't something that could be fixed overnight. Ragna briefly blamed himself.
‘Did I push him into death?’
He regretted it. His mouth had gotten him into trouble. What good had ever come from his interventions?
Now he had done it again. With a sigh of regret, Ragna resolved to stick close.
‘I want to protect him today.’
"The enemy!"
The time for battle approached quickly. Before they even dismantled their makeshift camp, the enemy infantry emerged from beyond the tall grass, advancing rapidly. It was an unnaturally swift march.
As the units gathered to face the enemy, the way the enemy’s units assembled was peculiar. Scattered groups each carried a tall banner.
Flap!
The flags on the banners fluttered strongly as a sudden wind blew from the enemy towards them. Squinting against the wind that stung his eyes, Enkrid sensed that this battle would not be easy. His survival instincts, honed over years, warned him. That instinct proved accurate quickly.
"What the hell?"
A squad leader at the front of the assembled infantry muttered. A familiar face. Squad Leader Benzence. They had exchanged awkward salutes when parting ways at the medical tent.
Now, thick fog began to form between Enkrid and the squad leader.
"We've been hit!"
Before the squad leader could speak, the Elf company commander assessed the situation. The elf's sensitive senses picked up the battlefield’s shift.
‘Magic? Sorcery?’
Thick fog began to roll in. It was not natural. The elf, attuned to nature, sensed something unnatural. The fog thickened quickly, soon obscuring everything.
"Commander!"
From the panic in the squad leader’s voice, the Elf commander realized something important.
‘No one was prepared for this.’
Suddenly, no one could see. Everyone must be panicking. This wasn't just a problem for the 4th Company. If this fog was artificially created, it wouldn't end soon.
This ominous feeling soon became reality.
Thud thud thud thud!
Bolts and arrows began to fly. Invisible arrows rained down. It was a sudden onslaught of death from beyond the fog.
Thud!
Bolts struck soldiers nearby, one even hitting the squad leader in the head. The Elf commander heightened her senses and quickly moved back. Arrows struck where she had stood.
She drew her sword and swung it.
Ting!
Two arrows clattered off her sword. She then grabbed the fallen squad leader’s body to use as a shield. Without it, she would be killed by stray arrows.
Fog and arrows.
‘A planned strategy.’
They had been thoroughly outmaneuvered.
"It worked!"
The commander of Azpen's forces felt a surge of joy. He would soon decorate this battlefield with victory. They had expended considerable resources for this. Failure was not an option. As the fog thickened, the commander shouted.
"Fire!"
His command, filled with joy and excitement, released a volley of prepared arrows and bolts at the enemy.
Azpen had used sorcery such as " The Fog of Annihilation" to blind their opponents! At the commander's cry, the sorcerer smiled with satisfaction.
The sorcery had succeeded.
It was a ritual using the blood of a hundred newborn lambs, calves, and foals, and water from an untouched lake. It wasn't just simple ingredients. Much had been sacrificed for this sorcery. The commander didn't know the details.
Nevertheless, the sorcerer had poured his heart and soul into it. The terrain, the climate, and the rain rituals had all been for this moment. The ground needed to be wet for the spell to work. The blood-soaked flags and poles were the medium for the spell. The soldiers protected by the poles were unaffected by the fog. This was the sorcerer’s trick.
But calling it "just a trick" was an understatement.
While the enemy couldn’t see, they could. Even a fool could see the immense advantage this provided in a large-scale battle. The sorcerer didn't care about the battle’s outcome. The success of the spell was his only joy.
"Happy with your success?"
The squad leader guarding the banner asked. He was the same skilled swordsman who had cornered Enkrid earlier.
"We almost failed, so yes, I’m happy," the sorcerer recalled the enemy’s night raid.
Their attack had nearly ruined months of preparation. Thinking back, it was terrifying. The squad leader remembered the one who led the night raid.
‘That bastard.’
As a member of the Gray Hound, also known as the Tenacious Lover, he wanted to kill that man himself. That man must be somewhere in the enemy camp. The Azpen squad leader would never forget the face illuminated by the torchlight. The delicate face of the enemy soldier. He wanted to meet him again.
As the fog spread, it carried the scent of water. Simultaneously, visibility vanished. Squad Leader Benzence, who had been in sight moments ago, disappeared.
Not only him. Ragna, who had been right next to him, was gone too.
"Sorcery!"
Someone shouted. No, it was Rem’s voice. He sounded frustrated.
"Which fucking bastard?"
Sorcery? What sorcery?
Enkrid crouched as he thought. Arrows and bolts flew overhead.
"Good job. Keep your head down."
A voice beside him. It was Ragna.
Ting! Thud!
Sounds of arrows above his head. His ominous feeling had become reality. Enkrid thought with his head down.
‘Sorcery.’
Why was there a sorcerer here?
Even among the Western Frontier tribes, sorcerers were rare. Why here?
The question was meaningless now. Enkrid dismissed the thought. Suddenly, a spearhead thrust toward him.
Thump.
The Heart of the Beast reacted. Boldness surfaced. Without it, he would have frozen and died. Enkrid instinctively twisted left and swung his sword upward.
Thwack!
He couldn’t cut the greased spear shaft with a clumsy slash. The shaft bounced away. A spearhead suddenly lunged from the fog. Enkrid gauged its position and tried to move forward.
Another spearhead came.
Thwack!
He barely blocked it again. As he did, he thought his stance was off, and his weight shift was messy. The only thing he did right was grip his sword tightly. He had forgotten all the things Ragna had nagged him about.
‘This is bad.’
He never expected to master it after one lesson. So, what should he do?
"Move back."
Ragna said. Enkrid moved the opposite way. Thanks to Jaxon, his hearing had sharpened. He couldn’t see, but he could hear.
"Argh!"
"Screech!"
"Die!"
"Damn it!"
Amid the screams and curses from all around, Enkrid moved.
"...Squad leader!"
Ragna’s startled shout came from behind him.
Then.
Thunk!
A spearhead pierced his neck.
‘Accurate.’
It was better than having his body pierced clumsily. Excruciating pain spread from his neck to his entire body.
Darkness began to close in.
"Crazy bastard."
The soldier who had speared Enkrid muttered. He had been startled when Enkrid suddenly lunged.
"Die."
The soldier kicked Enkrid away. The spearhead pulled out, causing a second wave of intense pain. Enkrid felt death approaching. A few more breaths, and darkness would envelop him.
He welcomed death.
What were excruciating pain and the terror of death, no matter how many times it happened?
‘Because of this.’
A new "today" had begun, where he could learn basics from Ragna. That thought filled him with joy.
"Gah."
Enkrid laughed through the blood. The enemy soldier recoiled, thinking he was facing a truly madman. Darkness came. When he opened his eyes, today began anew.
"Why do you go that far?"
Ragna asked. This time, Enkrid answered immediately, without scratching his forehead.
"Because I want to be good with a sword."
A different answer, but the goal was the same.
"Do you want to learn swordsmanship?"
Of course. Ragna offered again, and Enkrid accepted. The second day of basic training, the second "today" began. And he stood on the battlefield. The fog spread.
"Oh? Damn it!"
Rem cursed again. This time, Enkrid parried the spear shaft three times before letting it pierce his neck again. Unluckily, it hit at an angle. His neck skin tore, spilling blood on the ground.
‘Damn it.’
Bleeding out was too painful. Before he could think further, another enemy soldier thrust a spear at him. He was grateful.
Thunk.
He died again.
And the third "today" began.
Chapter 37: What is the Medium of Sorcery?
“Where did you learn those steps from?”
On the fifth day, Ragna suddenly asked.
‘Of course, you taught me.’
Enkrid couldn’t be honest.
“I’ve been to more than twenty training schools.”
Some of them were almost scams, but many taught properly.
“Hmm.”
Ragna nodded. Moving based on the steps learned from Ragna, a lively expression began to appear on Ragna's face. He was enjoying the moment. To be fair, Ragna wasn't an excellent teacher. He couldn't be.
A genius does not see what's beneath their feet. Therefore, it is difficult for them to teach the path they have taken. How can they explain something that just needs to be done?
If he says to strike down with the sword, he thinks it should be enough to just strike down. He doesn’t explain the necessary steps or the shift in weight. No, he can't explain it. He’s the worst type to run a swordsmanship training school. Enkrid realized this on the first day.
But that was okay. If the teacher was a mess, the student just had to do well. In that regard, Enkrid could be considered the best on the continent.
“Where should my feey go? In which direction should my toes point?”
“Do I really need to tell you that?”
It wasn’t a tone of criticism. He was genuinely curious.
“Yes.”
Ragna corrected his stance, showing the direction of the toes. That stance was a model of basic skills. Anyone with an eye for such things would drool at the sight of his talent. Just watching Ragna's stance repeatedly was helpful for Enkrid.
“What about the center of gravity?”
“Yes, do it with that timing.”
Enkrid asked, and Ragna answered. Throughout the repetition of twelve days, Ragna taught Enkrid only steps and stances.
“Stance and feet first, basics come next.”
“Sometimes, you swing it decently.”
“You couldn’t even chop wood with your current skill.”
“If the enemy soldier dies from your downward strike, tell him three times, ‘Thank you for dying.’”
“So, was I dancing just now?”
“Yes, it was a dance. Since you held a sword, it should be called a sword dance, but I don’t want to call it that. Let’s call it a stick dance.”
Ragna calmly unleashed his sharp tongue.
‘Was this bastard always like this?’
Rem was a much softer teacher. Sometimes, what he said was crazy, but it was still satisfactory. Every day, it felt like breaking an egg and being reborn. When Enkrid started the diagonal slash, Ragna spoke.
“The line connecting you and the opponent you are facing is called the attack line. This line is usually the shortest distance between the two and the path the weapon will take during an attack.”
“Blocking the opponent’s attack line and extending your own, this is also part of the basics. Do you understand? No, I don’t think you do. Ah, is this that thing? You understand it in your head, but your body doesn’t listen?”
“Let me say it again. The squad leader only understands with his mouth.”
Ragna was someone who couldn’t teach without spitting out sharp words. Learning and learning again.
Twenty five days passed.
“...I thought your basics were terrible, but you can use your feet.”
That’s what he said on the thirty-fifth day. By this time, Enkrid’s behavior had changed a bit. He no longer died immediately after the fog descended. He dodged the first spear thrust, rushed in, and died.
Spears stuck into his body like a porcupine. It was quite a decent method. Sometimes, one spear would miss.
Why would they pull back their spears when he was rushing to get killed?
It made sense. They’d be baffled to see someone suddenly charging to be killed. If the spear missed, he had to twitch and writhe for an hour before dying. It was a series of unbearable pains and a succession of dreadful moments. Every time, Ragna would call out or shout at Enkrid.
“Squad Leader!”
“Crazy!”
“Hey!”
Eventually, he was so desperate he just shouted “Hey.”
Enkrid diligently filled today.
“Your stance is better than I thought.”
Little by little, he improved. Every time he changed, Ragna frowned.
“Until yesterday...”
He muttered like this.
“...Where did you learn that?”
Around the hundredth day, Ragna said.
“Who are you?”
When he looked up, wondering what nonsense he was talking about.
“Until yesterday, you were a mess. How did you change so much in one day? Is it magic?”
Ragna was astonished. Enkrid laughed at the sight.
“Why? Do you think my skill is better than you expected?”
“It’s not just a little better. I doubt you’re really the squad leader.”
Ragna truly looked suspicious. This was the Troublemaker Squad, and Ragna was a weirdo too.
“So, are you not going to teach me?”
“That’s not it.”
Ragna hesitantly resumed.
Afterward, they wielded swords against imaginary opponents.
The concept of the attack line, the way to grip the sword, the method of using the sword for defense.
“If it’s a sword of good quality, you can block with the side. If not, block with the blade.”
“Slashing, thrusting, cutting— these three are the basics. Your steps and stance aren’t bad, so focus on these three fundamental sword techniques.”
Ragna taught a variety of steps.
Advancing, passing, digging in, evading, moving sideways, turning around, making a big turn. Just memorizing them was mind-boggling, but with practice, they became somewhat second nature. Even if he was dull, having a skilled person teach him one-on-one constantly improved his skills. Even the slight weaknesses that a genius wouldn’t notice were a continuous source of joy for Enkrid.
“Imagine the opponent in your mind and then swing the sword.”
Clang!
Through countless days, he kept learning.
Diagonal slashes, binding the sword, winding cuts, twisting slashes, upper horizontal slashes, side glances, top-down slashes, counter-attacks, half-sword fighting, parrying, deflecting, continuous strikes, thrusting, and drawing cuts.
As time passed, the sharp words decreased.
“You’re better than I thought. Where did you learn the binding technique?”
“One of the previous instructors drilled me to death on the binding.”
“That’s excellent.”
Ragna seemed satisfied with that. He used the same method when learning other techniques.
“They said my upper horizontal slashes were a mess in the previous training school. It would be good to start with swordsmanship from there.”
“...I’m the one teaching, but it seems you’ve already decided what to learn.”
“It’s not necessarily like that.”
Ragna conducted a short test when Enkrid shrugged. Then he followed Enkrid’s suggestion.
“Let’s do it that way.”
Ragna would never know, but after repeating the day countless times, after teaching, he would move on when he thought it was good enough. Each time, Enkrid progressed to the next step. Repeating today under the scorching sun, drenched in sweat. To some, it might be tedious enough to make them nauseous, but not for Enkrid.
Around the two-hundredth day.
“Hmm?”
When he opened his eyes, he saw a black river. What was happening?
A ferryman appeared. A ferryman with his eyes covered. His mouth didn’t seem to open, but his voice clearly pierced his ears.
“Are you crazy? You keep dying on purpose? You idiot.”
The ferryman’s tone was calm, but his words were not. Before he could respond, he woke from the dream.
Again, it was yet another familiar ‘today’.
Enkrid opened his eyes but didn’t move. He just fell into thought.
“Did you have a wet dream? What are you doing?”
Next to him, Rem made a noise like a puppy. Ignoring it, Enkrid got up.
‘Let’s just say he wanted to call me crazy.’
Even if he wanted to ask why, he couldn’t. There was no point in dwelling on unsolvable problems. Enkrid stood up.
“Do you know anything about sorcery?”
At those words, Rem turned his head sharply.
“Sorcery?”
“Tell me what you know.”
Every time the fog descended, Rem mentioned something related to sorcery. He must know something. All this time had been spent frantically training in the basics of swordsmanship, but now there was some leeway. The training had become ingrained in his body. Ragna would be surprised at his growing skills. He hadn’t tested his skills yet, but Enkrid felt he was improving.
“Sorcery is sorcery, what else would it be?”
“Tell me what you know. It sounds interesting.”
Normally, Enkrid wouldn’t be the one to start a conversation. Rem smirked and opened his mouth.
“What wind blew to make you curious? Fine. I’ll explain briefly. Do you know the difference between magic and sorcery?”
“Magic is more common.”
Though rare, magicians are occasionally seen. But sorcery? Even Enkrid, who traveled all over the continent, had never seen it. It was that rare.
“You’re not wrong.”
Rem said, tidying up his sleeping area. He roughly rolled up his blanket and pushed it aside, put on his boots, and stepped outside.
Enkrid followed him out.
It was the same today. He didn’t feel bored. No matter what today was like, it was always a pleasant day for Enkrid. Following him out, Rem continued.
“Sorcery requires a medium. I know magic sometimes needs a medium too, but for sorcery, the sacrifice or medium is incredibly important. Without it, sorcery can’t even begin.”
“Did your tribe use those things?”
Rem was from the western frontier. The reason that area became a frontier was because the central continental empire won a war. Before that, the west was the land of the nomadic tribes. This was over a hundred years ago.
Now it was firmly the western frontier, and the western nomadic tribes had been assimilated as one ethnic group. They were still called barbarians derogatorily, but sorcery originated from the west. That was common knowledge.
“I’ve seen it a few times. But you know there are very few true sorcerers, right? The ones wandering the continent are all charlatans, charlatans.”
If Rem said so, it must be true.
Enkrid nodded and went back to his work.
“Where are you going?”
“Training.”
He went to meet Ragna to further hone his basics. Around the two-hundred-fiftieth day of repeating today, Ragna said.
“Were your basics always this solid?”
He saw Ragna’s red pupils widen as he brushed back his blonde hair.
“It seems you originally focused on the longsword.”
Yes, that’s probably right. He had been training with this sword all this time. It felt awkward, but it fit his hand. Though it was his first time wielding it, this process had repeated many times. It was the familiarity gained through repeated days.
“It’s time for real combat.”
After the training, Ragna said. Enkrid nodded in agreement.
“What are you doing? They’re calling us.”
Rem called them. On the way back, Enkrid got some bread from Kraiss and chewed it. He soaked the hard bread in water, chewed, and swallowed it, and also got some jerky to eat. He checked his equipment and stood on the battlefield again. With the longsword he exchanged with Ragna swinging at his waist, Rem asked.
“Didn’t you say the sword you used was expensive?”
“This one feels more familiar.”
“I’ve seen many guys who switched weapons overnight and ended up dead.”
Was that a curse or a concern?
“Worry about yourself.”
Exhaling deeply, he steeled himself. He couldn’t rely solely on the Heart of the Beast for courage. If it’s a real fight, it should serve as a step towards ‘tomorrow.’ Enkrid thought before the enemy came into view.
‘Sorcery requires a medium.’
That medium was extremely important according to Rem.
If the enemy’s presence in the tall grass wasn’t an ambush but concealment?
If they had something to hide?
Enkrid had already seen it. A pole and a flag. When he set fire to one tent, they were more concerned with putting out the fire than killing the intruder. Soon the enemy came into view. A soldier from the third squad next to him frowned as he held his spear.
“What’s with their formation?”
If the formation centered around the pole, it had no tactical value. Then it must have purely sorcery value. Six poles with flags rose among the enemy. They were mediums for sorcery.
“Huh!”
Fog spread, obscuring his vision. Now, let’s swim through the sorcery fog.
Enkrid’s ears twitched.
His keen hearing, acquired from Jaxon, would take the place of his eyes.
Chapter 38: The Flags Flutter, and the Soldiers Dance with Swords (1)
“Do I really have to learn the sword all over again?”
Ragna had made a sharp remark. It implied that Enkrid's body wasn’t following properly, and it was true. Enkrid wasn’t born with talent. He lived by adding stubborn effort to his dull body.
However, he had met countless instructors, learned swordsmanship, and spent time contemplating alone. His thinking was flexible, and his adaptability was excellent. Learning was difficult at first, but once he mastered it, entering real combat was different. He had a natural talent for it. Flexibility and adaptability were Enkrid’s talents.
'Use anything as the situation demands, as needed.'
By the standards of the Kingdom of Naurillia, he was at least intermediate. In the mercenary world, he was also intermediate. Wherever he went, his skill level was about average; that was Enkrid's current position.
But regardless of his skill, his combat power in actual battle was exceptional. Having lived with meager talent, Enkrid knew how to make full use of what he had.
A soldier’s spear flew towards him. His keen ears heard the whoosh of the piercing air.
It wasn’t as precise as what he saw with his eyes, but he grasped the direction. He envisioned the enemy’s movement in his mind.
‘Side-stepping step.’
Enkrid stepped. The Heart of the Beast granted him boldness. He put strength in his left heel and pulled his right foot back, turning his body. Due that move, the spearhead whizzed past his eyes. Even though the spearhead suddenly appeared out of the fog, Enkrid wasn’t flustered.
There was no need to be. It was a spear that had already stabbed him to death dozens of times. He had dodged the first thrust over two hundred times. Instead of drawing his sword, Enkrid grabbed the middle of the spear shaft and pulled. With a yank, the enemy soldier was pulled forward and opened his mouth in surprise.
“What?”
The soldier’s head emerged from the fog, and Enkrid grabbed and twisted it.
Crunch.
The soldier’s neck broke. A broken neck is fatal. The enemy soldier collapsed, and Enkrid took the dead soldier’s spear. He recalled the enemy’s formation in his mind before the fog spread. They were all clustered together.
‘No matter where I throw, I’ll hit someone.’
He stamped the ground with his left foot and threw with all his might. The spear flew through the air and struck something with a thunk.
“Ack!”
A death cry was heard.
“What the hell?”
“Damn it!”
The enemy’s voices of confusion followed. Listening carefully, Enkrid bent low and ran forward. Even if someone could see through the fog, it would be difficult to spot someone charging in from below.
Thud, thud, thud!
Bolts and arrows flew overhead.
“Argh!”
“Ugh!”
“Shit, arrows!”
The screams and curses of his allies erupted from behind. His hair stood on end, but it was fine. He had done this countless times before. The real problem was the lack of tension. Enkrid closed the distance and drew his longsword. His ears gauged the distance accurately.
Swish!
He drew his sword and held it with both hands, swinging it horizontally in an upper slash. Originally, an upper horizontal slash is a technique to block the opponent’s sword with the guard and cut with the back edge. Enkrid modified it as he pleased. The stance was similar.
He held the sword horizontally above his head and changed his grip. It was a thumb grip with the thumb up. In that stance, he drew a circle with the sword. Because of his low posture, the upper horizontal slash became a lower horizontal slash. It was a ridiculous stance, so there wasn’t much force behind the sword.
But it was an unexpected strike. The enemy didn’t react.
Whoosh!
Thud! Thud!
He felt resistance as the blade cut through.
“Argh!”
“What the hell!”
“The ground!”
‘Oh, they spotted me quickly.’
Emerging from the fog and rising up, Enkrid saw the enemy soldiers. Though his field of vision was limited to the range of his sword, it was better than nothing. He saw the enemy and their weapons and his own sword. The situation was different from before.
Three enemies had deep cuts on their shins. They were all armed with crossbows. One of them gritted his teeth and aimed his crossbow.
Enkrid sidestepped. He stepped diagonally forward with his left foot, followed by his right. In an instant, his position changed.
The bolt flew through the space where he had been. Enkrid didn’t just dodge the quarrel. He attempted a vertical slash simultaneously. The heavy longsword fell from above.
The enemy soldier with the crossbow instinctively drew a shortsword, trying to block by crossing it with the longsword.
Enkrid crushed it with force.
Clang! Crack!
Unable to withstand the force, the shortsword’s opposite edge pressed against the leather helmet and dug into the soldier’s head. It wasn’t a cut but a crushing blow.
Crunch.
With a spurt of blood, the soldier with the crushed head fell backward. Blood flowed through the indent in the leather helmet, creating a red curtain in front of the soldier’s face.
“Ugh, ugh.”
The soldier couldn’t speak and fell on his butt, his eyes growing dim. Enkrid retrieved his sword, took a step back, and turned. He quickly moved a step sideways. A spear flew into the spot where he had been standing. The spearhead grazed his left side, tearing his cloth armor slightly. That was all.
After dodging, he thrust his sword. Not quickly, but slowly. The soldier who swung the spear reflexively pulled back and blocked with the spear shaft.
Thunk.
The sword and the spear shaft met. The sword began to slide down the shaft. Advancing, he followed with a bind and a cutting motion.
Scrrr!
The spear shaft grated under the sword.
Thud!
The sword’s final destination was the soldier’s chest. The blade had slid down the shaft and tore into the soldier’s chest. Flesh was ripped, and bones were shattered. When he withdrew the sword, blood spurted out.
The blood splattered on Enkrid’s chest. He slightly bent his knees as he retrieved the sword and stood up. With a snap, he straightened his knees and stood tall.
All he had learned so far were the basics. It had been a time to break bad habits and build anew. To be fair, he had only just reached his previous level.
But now, having trained the basics, he was vastly different. It was like attaching wings to a lion.
Enkrid's flexible thinking yielded results beyond his skill. Blood-soaked, his sword moved among the remaining soldiers. Enkrid silently danced with his sword.
There were six flag units.
The commander of the Duchy of Azpen thought.
‘Even if they notice it’s sorcery, they won’t know which of the six flags to destroy.’
Victory was assured. It was time to consider what kind of victory to claim.
“Cut off their retreat.”
The Gray Hound unit, acting as an independent force, moved. It was behind the Kingdom of Naurillia's troops. If the startled troops tried to retreat, they would encounter the Gray Hound unit. The commander issued orders and reviewed his plan for errors.
There were none.
General Frog had come to ensure this operation wouldn’t fail. Otherwise, a general wouldn’t have come to this battlefield.
The commander gave another order.
“Kill them all.”
This battle would change the positions of Azpen and Naurillia. As his orders were issued, Enkrid was dancing with his sword in the first flag unit.
“Damn it!”
The battalion commander of Naurillia thought he was having a nightmare.
‘We were caught off guard.’
If the enemy had prepared something, so had they. But if they lost their troops here, all preparations would be for naught.
“Retreat! Retreat!”
Shouts to retreat echoed everywhere. The battalion commander wasn’t composed.
“Ack!”
Bolts flew at the retreating allies.
‘Damn crossbow units!’
The battalion commander felt a chill. He marveled at how they had hidden so many crossbows.
Where? The scout reports had already answered that.
‘The tall grass!’
Now wasn’t the time to be thinking about this. The battalion commander’s mind sought escape from reality.
“Get a grip! Regroup!”
Two competent company commanders tried to reorganize their units, but the enemy’s skill was exceptional.
The unit retreating backward was the Gray Hound unit. The independent company that the Azpen army was proud of. The battalion commander realized they were trapped. He desperately tried to regain his composure.
“It’s the Fog of Annihilation! Azpen's sorcerers have cast it!”
Those bastards.
“How do we dispel the fog?”
Few of his officers had an answer.
“Bring me someone who knows!”
He couldn’t see ahead, and enemies were pounding his troops from front and rear. At this rate, they could be annihilated. No, they would be annihilated without a doubt.
Soon, an officer brought an answer.
“We must destroy the sorcery medium!”
The medium? The flagpoles.
“Charge toward the flagpoles!”
The battalion commander shouted.
“...We don’t know where the flagpoles are.”
An officer uttered in despair. The enemy troops had rotated positions like clockwork. They kept moving positions like clockwork. They kept moving in circles, making it impossible to pinpoint their location.
The battalion commander couldn't erase the thought of annihilation from his mind. While he was groaning in frustration, the elf company commander of the fourth company realized the enemy wouldn’t let them retreat so easily.
Her prediction was correct. And it wasn’t a good thing.
‘Without a turnaround, we’ll all die.’
She thought the battlefield needed a new wind, but that wind didn’t blow. The battle ended in a crushing defeat. The elf company commander narrowly survived, evading death.
As she fled, the fog lifted. It was annihilation. Less than fifty of their allies survived.
Clang!
Enkrid fought well. He fought exceptionally well and was satisfied. Although his allies were nearly wiped out, he alone had taken down about twenty enemy soldiers. Blood flowed from his hand that gripped the sword. It was because his forearm had been slashed in the recent battle.
‘I’m losing strength.’
He had only spent time training in the basics so far. Ragna had said not to spar until he was complete— until he had gotten rid of his bad habits.
And then he immediately added.
“This isn’t something you can say on the battlefield.”
Even he must have realized it was nonsense. Telling him not to fight to eliminate bad habits in the middle of a battlefield.
So, should he just quietly die?
But Enkrid could do it. By calmly surrendering his life, he excluded combat practice. And today, for the first time, he demonstrated his skills in actual combat.
‘Different.’
Until now, he had fought using whatever means necessary, whether it was Vallen Style mercenary swordsmanship or anything else. That hadn’t changed. The only difference was that swordsmanship now formed the core of his fighting style.
‘I want to learn more.’
The desire to learn surged. He didn’t want to stop at the basics. The enemy soldiers didn’t easily approach Enkrid, who had killed the soldiers of two squads by himself.
For some reason, while holding his ground, Enkrid's vision cleared. The sorcery-induced fog no longer affected him. He saw the enemy soldiers forming a semicircle in front of him. All of them held crossbows.
“Let’s fight one-on-one, like men.”
Wanting to test his newly acquired skills one more time, he said.
“Crazy bastard.”
The soldier who appeared to be the squad leader responded.
Thud, thud, thud!
Crossbows twanged. Bolts embedded themselves all over his body. The bolt that struck his eye brought excruciating pain.
‘Agony.’
But he was also happy. As he lay dying, Enkrid thought of what he needed to do in the repeated today. Ragna had constantly emphasized the basics.
“Train and train again. Keep fighting for your life, and eventually, it’ll stick to your body.”
It was irresponsible advice, but it had meaning. Enkrid needed more real combat. The words ‘death’ settled over his entire body. Before taking his last breath, an enemy soldier looked down at him and said.
“You tough bastard.”
Even then, Enkrid held his sword tightly. The blood he shed pooled on the ground.
“No matter what, even if you’re dying, never let go of your sword. That’s the first thing.”
Countless instructors had said this, Ragna had said it, and Rem had said the same. Enkrid did just that.
“Ptooey!”
An enemy soldier who had lost many comrades spat on Enkrid’s face.
That was the end.
Morning dawned.
A new today began.
Enkrid reflected on what he gained from yesterday's fight.
‘I need more real combat.’
That was the conclusion he reached. He sought Ragna again to learn.
“The basics are solid, but it’s like you’ve trained alone your whole life. Where did you learn the fundamentals of swordsmanship?”
That was true. He felt the same. What he needed now was real combat.
“Here and there.”
“...Here and there? Okay, let’s go with that. It’s good to make what you’ve practiced come out naturally in sparring. And whoever your teacher is, they taught you well.”
That teacher was you. Ragna unwittingly praised himself. Enkrid responded in his mind and focused on sparring. It was incredibly enjoyable.
In the next repeated battle, Enkrid alone cut down thirty enemy soldiers. It wasn’t solely due to his skill. Bolts and arrows were flying. He dodged them skillfully and achieved this. He had to use his wits. That was the only way to extend his real combat experience. He repeated several todays and swung his sword again.
Before long, the basics had stuck to his body perfectly.
“In terms of basics, there’s nothing more I can teach you.”
Eventually, Ragna said this, acknowledging Enkrid’s significant improvement.
Chapter 39: The Flags Flutter, and the Soldiers Dance with Swords (2)
"Eyes, feet and hands."
Ragna had said.
“You start with your eyes, move with your feet, and finish with your hands. That’s how you wield a sword.”
He followed Ragna’s words. By seeing, he predicted the opponent’s movements, positioned himself with his feet, and moved the sword only to finish.
Hooong.
He applied this in the next battle. Instead of reacting to what he saw, he dodged by predicting the attack. As a result, the opponent's attack line missed Enkrid, while his attack line reached the enemy. Thrusting the sword was merely a confirmation.
Thuck!
The sword pierced through the enemy’s throat. Pulling it sideways, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels were severed, and blood gushed out.
As soon as Enkrid killed one soldier, he rolled on the ground and slammed the pommel into the shin of another soldier standing nearby.
Crunch!
Without any protective gear, the bone broke easily.
“Argh!”
The fallen soldier thrashed about. Enkrid picked up a fallen bolt and drove it into the soldier’s heart. The armor prevented the arrow from fully penetrating. He rose up and pressed it down with his foot.
Thuck! The bolt sank to its hilt.
Lifting the dead soldier with one hand, he tilted the body aside.
Thunk, thunk! The bolt was buried into the corpse.
Enkrid made a small mistake here. A bolt grazed his thigh. Reduced mobility made it harder to fight among the enemies. Still, he did what he could.
Thirty-two.
He had killed two more in one day despite the mistake in the middle.
‘Eyes, feet and hands.’
He saw with his eyes, moved with his feet, and finished with his hands. He thought it would be good to practice this a few more times in actual combat.
Enkrid did just that. By repeating today, he also got a rough sense of the enemy’s movements.
‘They protect the flagpoles.’
And they always circled in one direction. One day he charged straight ahead, the next day he dashed to the left. He had never broken a flagpole, but he had come close to touching it.
Enkrid felt a thirst. He felt something was missing.
‘Can I even do it alone?’
If not, he could bring Rem or Ragna along, but he felt stubborn. He had learned proper swordsmanship and mastered it. He wanted to take one more step forward. He wasn’t impatient, but he repeatedly felt it was time to move forward.
‘Let’s see.’
If it turned out he was just being stubborn, he could reconsider later. Enkrid had the chance to repeat today.
“Who the hell are you?”
After several battles, he faced an enemy squad leader. He didn’t recognize the face. It was a new guy with a rat-like mustache.
“What do you think?”
Enkrid replied with a smirk. He couldn’t have faced death so boldly. The rat-mustache of the Azpen Duchy swallowed nervously and thrust his spear.
“Unlucky bastard.”
After dying and waking up again, it was back to training. Once he got used to the concept of eyes, feet, and hands, Ragna moved on. What had started with basic skills now included the history and concepts of swordsmanship.
“Fortunately, the roots of what you learned align with mine.”
It was natural. Ragna had taught him.
“You’re lucky to have mimicked an especially good instructor.”
Enkrid said something that didn’t make sense, but Ragna had no choice but to believe him. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense. It was understandable that he improved overnight. If he had been training the basics alone but didn’t know how to apply them, this could happen.
Though it was still unusual, ignoring it was easier. They decided to move on from the fundamentals of Northern-style swordsmanship with the same concept.
What was the point of questioning it?
The squad leader never questioned his past. So Ragna decided he wouldn’t either.
“Do you know? Precision, Power, Mysticism, Speed and Flow.”
Ragna said, and Enkrid nodded.
The correct and precise sword.
The heavy and fierce sword.
The enchanting and swaying sword.
The fast and faster sword.
The soft and flowing sword.
Five hundred years ago, an extraordinary genius was born. Born in a small farmhouse, he was a genius among geniuses. At the age of nine, he killed a gang of bandits with nothing but a fire poker. At the age of nine, he killed twelve adult bandits, even those proficient with swords.
“This is swordsmanship.”
The nine-year-old was precocious. It was said he lost his parents early. By watching the bandits wield their swords, he grasped the principles of swordsmanship.
After hearing that a nine-year-old boy had killed twelve bandits with a fire poker, a noble sought him out. The noble adopted the boy.
Thus, the boy was given the surname Oniac.
Leonessis Oniac.
The genius thus gained a name. Leonessis was endowed with talent from heaven, but he also bore great misfortune. At around ten years old, he contracted a disease that weakened his limbs. It was an incurable disease that no mage, doctor, or healer on the continent could treat.
Before he turned twelve, his entire body was paralyzed. Despite the illness, the Oniac family did not abandon Leonessis. The unfortunate genius was almost forgotten.
But at the age of twenty, paralyzed, he left a mark on the history of swordsmanship on the continent. He compiled all existing swordsmanship into five categories.
These were Precision, Power, Mysticism, Speed and Flow.
The correct and precise sword.
The heavy and fierce sword.
The enchanting and swaying sword.
The fast and faster sword.
The soft and flowing sword.
Despite being unable to use his body, he rewrote the history of swordsmanship. This marked the beginning of the transformation of the Oniac family into the greatest in the empire. The swordsmanship school created by Leonessis was passed down through generations and became an established doctrine.
Today, it was commonly referred to as Northern-style swordsmanship, Central-style correct swordsmanship and soft swordsmanship, Western-style fast swordsmanship, Southern-style enchanting swordsmanship, and Eastern-style technical swordsmanship.
The continent was broadly divided into five regions, each developing its weapon techniques differently.
“To use Northern-style swordsmanship, I’ve developed a technique. It’ll be more useful than the beast’s innards.”
It was another sunny, windy day. On this day, Enkrid learned a new technique from Ragna.
From Rem, he learned the Heart of the Beast.
From Jaxon, the sense of the blade.
And from Ragna, he learned a technique called Focus Point.
“The principle is simple. Forget everything around you, focus your eyes on the opponent, and concentrate on what you’re doing. Focus on nothing else.”
The explanation was terrible.
“The essence of Northern-style swordsmanship lies in its basics. It’s known as the sword that breaks even when blocked, the sword that can’t be avoided even when known, and the sword that pours all its power into one strike. That’s how you do it. Focus.”
If focusing was all it took, then what of those who couldn’t do it?
“Let me show you the trick.”
With those words, Ragna’s sword became a streak of light. Even though he had just changed his sword, the blade wasn’t visible. Even his arm, which swung like a whip, was invisible. Just in a flash, something passed by his neck.
Swish.
The blade grazed his neck. The sword was so fast that he only realized his neck was cut after it happened. His nape grew warm. Blood trickled down.
“Are you bullying the squad leader again?”
Rem appeared and glared. Enkrid touched his neck.
‘That was close.’
It was a dangerously close strike. The blade had grazed his skin with unseen speed.
“They say humans become several times more focused when facing death. I’m helping.”
“This crazy bastard, what good is learning such a technique after you’re dead? Do you even know how long it took the squad leader to master the Heart of the Beast? Huuuh?”
Why was he emphasizing weirdly? Wasn’t the ‘huh’ too long?
As Enkrid tried to speak, Ragna snorted.
“The teacher was bad.”
“Huh? You want me to chop your head with an axe?”
Rem placed one hand behind his ear and said.
“I’m not an ignorant barbarian. My teaching methods are rational.”
Rational? Enkrid pondered the meaning of that word.
To him, Rem and Ragna were equally difficult.
“But if you’re from the polar tribes, aren’t you also a barbarian?”
Ragna had pale skin and red eyes, characteristic of the northern tribes.
“Don’t lump me with Western barbarians. It’s offensive. Very offensive.”
“...Fine, just die. When you do, I’ll personally go north and bury you.”
If left alone, they’d probably continue bickering. Enkrid intervened.
“You know what I’m going to say, right?”
Despite his intervention, Ragna looked past Enkrid.
“I know the squad leader is as dull as a Northern ox. But I didn’t realize you had mastered the basics so well.”
“What the hell, don’t change the subject. Get your head ready. I’m going to chop it with an axe.”
“Crazy barbarian.”
Northern oxen minimize movement to endure the cold. It’s a metaphor for dull people. Although both Ragna and Rem kept calling Enkrid dull, he didn’t feel wronged.
“You said you’d teach me the trick.”
Enkrid held Ragna back with his words and turned to Rem.
No words were needed. Just a look. Rem, still fuming, saw Enkrid staring at him and snorted loudly before shouting.
“They told us to gather!”
Then he turned and stomped back to the camp.
“It’s time to go back,” Ragna said, watching Rem leave. He began to sheathe his sword, but Enkrid grabbed his wrist.
“The trick?”
The thirst for knowledge drove Enkrid. Especially now, as he was about to learn something new.
Focus Point, Ragna called it, a refined technique handed down from old secrets.
“I’m warning you, it won’t be easy.”
The basics hadn’t been easy. Learning new stances, steps, discarding bad habits, and mastering slashes and thrusts— none of it had been easy.
Yet, it had been enjoyable.
The thrill of growth filled him every day. Even though he aspired to be a knight, perhaps it was his love for the sword that had driven him this far. When wielding the sword, Enkrid forgot about everything else and felt pure joy. Holding Ragna’s wrist, Enkrid listened intently.
“When you’re on the brink of death, humans naturally become much more focused. It’s about harnessing that sensation and repeating it.”
Learning the Heart of the Beast had been similar. However, while the Heart of the Beast required boldness in the face of death, Ragna’s Focus Point demanded the opposite. You had to desperately fight to avoid dying. That fear of death would sharpen your nerves like needles.
‘I’ll combine it with real combat.’
Enkrid formulated a plan and set it in motion.
“It won’t be enough just to learn the trick,” Ragna warned.
“Describe what it feels like when you master it.”
“It feels like everything else fades away, and the sword moves as you will it.”
Ragna spoke candidly. Enkrid looked into Ragna’s red eyes, noticing a rare seriousness.
‘What wind has blown through him?’
Ragna was whimsical. But he had never been this passionately engaged before. With a hidden passion, his eyes burning like embers, Ragna said, “It’s time to go.”
Enkrid nodded in agreement.
“Let’s go.”
The battle began again, and the fog rolled in.
“Damn sorcery?” Rem cursed.
“Keep low!”
Ragna shouted to Enkrid as he charged.
Previously, Ragna would have been too busy trying to stop him. But now, he knew Enkrid wouldn’t fall to a mere soldier. Charging forward, Enkrid followed the sequence of eyes, feet, and hands against the enemy soldiers.
‘Start with the crossbow unit.’
One thing had changed; after repeating today several times, Enkrid had memorized the enemy’s formation.
To be precise, he hadn’t just memorized it. It had become second nature.
Before the first enemy soldier could thrust his spear, Enkrid closed in and drove his dagger upward. The dagger pierced through the chin and into the roof of the mouth. He abandoned the dagger and shoved the dying soldier with his shoulder.
“Ah!”
“Ugh!”
The soldier stumbled back in surprise. At that moment, Enkrid threw two more daggers. The daggers flew and pierced the throats of two more soldiers. It was an impressive feat.
Drawing his longsword, he executed a diagonal slash.
Clang!
A spear shaft blocked the slash. Expecting this, Enkrid used the rebound force to retrieve his sword and slashed the neck of the soldier on the opposite side.
