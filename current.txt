In an instant, he noticed the child carrying the basket turn and walk down the alley, then crouch, face going pale, both hands clamping his stomach. He finally set the basket down against the wall and began to writhe on the ground.

The next moment, at Chen Ping’an’s and the child’s ears alike, it sounded as if drums were beating — and someone’s voice repeating two words over and over: “Don’t die.”

In a flash, Chen Ping’an opened his eyes aboard the Night Ferry, baffled.

In a lightning-split instant, who that person had been could not be seen clearly; the voice had been heard, yet he could not remember it.

“Jian Lai” Chapter 809 — Footsteps

They disembarked and went ashore; there was still some distance to the Skeleton Shoal ferry point. That was fine — Chen Ping’an had planned that when he returned to Baoping Continent he would make a detour to Muyu Mountain where the Pima Sect’s patriarchal hall stood. As for Wall-Painting City and the like, he would not bother; the opportunities were gone and the painted illustrations had become mere ink sketches.

But Chen Ping’an intended to first visit Naihe Pass market — that is, the entrance area to the Ghost Ravine. Now that Ghost Ravine had lost its backbone with Gao Cheng’s disappearance, it had lost central leadership. The Jingguan City cluster was leaderless; the lord of Fulongcheng, Pu Rang, had gone to the Baoping Continent battlefield and likewise vanished. Only rumors circulated — some said Pu Rang had traveled to the western Buddhist countries with a monk. With Gao Cheng and Pu Rang gone, the heroic spirits and ghosts of Funichi City and its satellites had hastily formed a loose coalition and then reached a pact with the Pima Sect: they would not attack each other for a hundred years. So Ghost Ravine had completely changed its face. Though still grim with yin-energy, foreign cultivators could no longer come in to train there because Pima protection had been withdrawn and the various ghosts now closely grouped together. Still, if someone truly felt that by themselves they could run amok through Ghost Ravine and start slaughtering, the Pima Sect would not stop them.

Chen Ping’an carried a Night You (night-walking) sword on his back and a vermilion wine gourd at his waist.

Ning Yao wore a golden-li ceremonial robe and carried a sword case on her back.

Pei Qian carried a bamboo box and a walking staff; inside stood a black-clad girl. Xiao Mili was counting on her fingers when they would return to their hometown, the great Dumb Lake.

The white-haired child was still practicing an illusion, looking like a jade-pierced snake threading celestial robes.

Besides Chen Ping’an there was a flying-ascension level sword cultivator, a flying-ascension transformed outsider demon, a peak-mountain level bottlenecked martial man, and of course a grotto-realm great water monster.

Fortunately Gao Cheng was not in Jingguan City right now — otherwise he’d be the one stopping Chen Ping’an from leaving.

They lingered briefly at Skeleton Shoal and then resumed their journey; Chen Ping’an did not intend to board Song Lanqiao’s Spring Dew Garden ferry.

The Spring Dew Garden affair was complicated because it involved business money flows, the incense-line connections of two mountain halls, private friendships between cultivators, and matters of face… but at root it was all human hearts. So even Zhu Xian — Luopo Mountain’s steward — plus the accountant Wei Wenlong and mountain lord Wei Bo found the issue a headache.

Chen Ping’an would first go to Suijia City in Yinp­ing State to drink at the Fire God Temple. Eight hundred li beyond the county seat lay Cangyun Lake — the lake lord Yin Hou should surely have a new “dragon seat.” Whether the channel-mistress of Shaoxi and Tiaoxi had been replaced, he didn’t know.

Dumb Lake lay on the border of Baoxiang State. Afterwards he would go to Jinwu Palace to catch up with Sword-Immortal Liu, then to Spring Dew Garden, to Caique Mansion, to Yunshang City where Xu Xingjiu was, then to Padi Peak to find Zhang Shanfeng, and bring wine to Grandmaster of Taihui Sword School — the famed Wine Immortal.

The Chongxuan Office of the Dayuan Dynasty would require a proper visit too; courtesy demands reciprocity — to call on Emperor Lu and court-master Yang Qingkong, then visit Li Cai’s Floating Reed Sword Lake to see the two sword apprentices Chen Li and Gao Youqing. After meeting the canal duke Shen Lin and Li Yuan — besides thanking them for escorting Chen Lingjun’s canal voyage — he would discuss leasing or buying Fushui Island in the Dragon Palace Celestial Realm…

There were indeed many places Chen Ping’an planned to visit in Beiku Luzhou.

They rode the wind and soon could see the towering Muyu Mountain and the north–south Swaying River.

After leaving the Night Ferry and going ashore, Chen Ping’an kept twirling that bluish talisman between his fingers to confirm the Night Ferry’s location in Haoran’s world and to check his estimate of its speed. His only worry was that, while he could locate the Night Ferry with that talisman, the Night Ferry could likewise locate him. Earlier on the boat he had hesitated and not asked Captain Zhang about this. He casually said, “In my bout with Cao Ci when we left the Meritorious Grove and fought over at the Wenmiao plaza, I and Cao Ci agreed to each hold back twenty percent.”

Ning Yao asked curiously, “He agreed to that?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Of course. Friends do that — no reason not to. As return, I suggested he bet his savings on the ‘No Defeat’ match — he’ll make big money.” Ning Yao was speechless.

To propose Cao Ci bet on your own loss? Few would dare joke with Cao Ci like that.

Chen Ping’an began to explain the local customs around Naihe Pass: in the past, marsh and mountain wanderers who came to idly roam here had a standard three-step routine — pray at the Swaying River shrine for blessings, then go to Wall-Painting City to try their luck, and finally buy a copy of the “Rest-Assured Collection” and, with head bowed, enter Ghost Ravine — whether one could come back depended on fate.

But those were old ways now. The once-worry-inducing booklet was no longer printed by the Pima Sect. With Wall-Painting City closed and its luck-granting paintings gone, the crowds thinned; marked as having lost Gao Cheng and Pu Rang and secretly stripped of the big moon-temple monk and Gao Zhen of the Minor Xuan Capital, Ghost Ravine had become fractured — a scatter of weak local powers and footless towns. Formally they had pacts with Muyu Mountain, water separate from wells, but privately many were swearing fealty to Pima.

Chen Ping’an pointed to the cultivator sites outside the small realm of Ghost Ravine and smiled: “Sanlang Temple makes a special meditation cushion. If we have time, buy a few and take them back to Luopo Mountain.”

Luopo Mountain used to have many pure martial folk and few cultivators; when Chen Ping’an next returned, the situation had changed: there were nine sword-immortal seedlings including Bai Xuan.

Jiang Qu had become a relatively rare talisman cultivator. Chen Ping’an reorganized the “True Traces of the Pill Tome” into graded volumes for talisman drawing, and gave Jiang Qu the first volume only. Besides Li Xisheng’s marginal notes, Chen Ping’an added his own talisman insights, so Jiang Qu treasured the manuscript.

Chen Ping’an’s main reason for coming to Ghost Ravine was to make a brief trip to Yangchang Palace. He probably wouldn’t bring Ning Yao and the others — he would leave them to wait. One cannot only look at the high peaks like Padi Peak or masters such as the Fire-Dragon True-Man; one must also notice the little gate-spirits at Yangchang Palace and the two books they hide underground.

But even in the tiniest market a woman can find a flower to bloom.

Ning Yao was no exception: either she didn’t browse, or when she did it was with thoroughness — she would leave no shop unchecked.

When they finally found a rare little bookshop at Naihe Pass and it was Chen Ping’an’s turn to browse, he paused at the door, then strode in — since they had met it, the small mountain-fate that allowed this meeting ought not be evaded.

The shopkeeper was a couple, both grotto-realm in cultivation. In the muddled marketplace of Naihe Pass, that rank was unimpressive. The little shop sold “Rest-Assured Collections” and goddess prints bought from Wall-Painting City, attempting to make a profit; they also traded trivial sundries with Funichi City, which was how they had some root in the market. The shop had been open ten-plus years; after rent and costs they made little immortal coin, but compared to a life of itinerant hardship they were steadier.

The shopkeeper’s wife saw the blue-robed swordsman enter and was moved to tears, smearing her eyes and elbowing her husband hard in the ribs.

The man looked bewildered at first, then when he saw Chen Ping’an his feelings mirrored his wife’s — they had finally found the unknowable lifesaver.

Especially the pair recognized those eyes that once belonged to a young sword-immortal.

In truth, Chen Ping’an did not know the couple’s names either. Their earlier meeting had been a fleeting brush of fate; ordinarily that would not lead to reunion. Years ago, after they had given five sets of skeletons from Crow Ridge, Chen Ping’an had not expected to see them again; as for debts, Chen Ping’an did not care one whit.

“Don’t pry into how I earn my money. Don’t pry into how I spend it.”

It had been that pair of impoverished roaming cultivator spouses who, when Chen Ping’an and friends entered Ghost Ravine, had set out to risk their lives. The wife’s talent was only average; to break through and reach grotto realm she needed a spirit implement to tidy her natal qi channels — she could do the heavy work but not the delicate. Wandering folk often had to scrounge off leftover tastes from pedigree sects. No matter how much the couple scraped together, they were five hundred snow-flower coins short. The woman’s cultivation could not be delayed; reluctantly they went to Ghost Ravine to try their luck. At the river-god shrine that night they knelt and kowtowed with utmost sincerity, and ever since on new-and-full moon days they kept the vow and paid respects.

They had opened the little shop to repay debts.

Side by side the couple bowed to the young sword-immortal, hands clasped in a ritual salutation.

Chen Ping’an took the man’s arm gently and smiled: “No need for such formality.”

When they rose, Chen Ping’an clasped his fists to congratulate: “Congratulations, madam, on reaching mid-five realm.”

The woman was flustered and performed a polite prostration, too nervous to speak.

The man introduced himself: his name was Jin Zhan, from the Dayuan Court; his wife was Song Jiazi from Qingci State. By coincidental fate they had taken up the path of cultivation.

They had kept a rendezvous agreement with the young sword-immortal and had waited a month at Naihe Pass. When they could not delay further they left Skeleton Shoal to purchase the spirit implement that would allow the breakthrough. After Song Jiazi successfully broke through, Jin Zhan had returned to wait for their benefactor.

Facing the blue-clad sword group today, the couple felt embarrassed; itinerant cultivators would not dare call themselves true Daoists — only those with clear master-lineage among the pedigree cultivators could be mountain-residing couples. There was an unwritten rule on the mountain.

Chen Ping’an smiled: “I am Chen Ping’an, from Longquan County of Baoping Continent. Our mountain is Luopo Mountain, near North Peak, close to Piyun Mountain. Welcome to visit when you head south.” Piyun Mountain’s mountain lord Wei Bo was renowned; cultivators across North Beiku Luzhou had heard his name.

The man glanced at his wife: “See? I guessed right — our benefactor must be a pedigree master. That air — not the kind of wild cultivator who treats money like dirt.”

Song Jiazi rolled her eyes; there was no need to compete. Besides, he guessed the benefactor was from a powerful family — not impossible.

Chen Ping’an pointed to Pei Qian and introduced: “This is my first disciple, Pei Qian — a martial hand.”

He then patted Xiao Mili’s head: “Our mountain’s guardian attendant is Zhou Mili.”

Pei Qian clasped her fists in salute. Xiao Mili puffed up her chest.

Ning Yao introduced herself: “I’m Ning Yao, a swordswoman.”

If Chen Ping’an had introduced them, who knew what nonsense he would have blurted.

Jin Zhan whispered: “Chen Sword-Immortal — shall we retrieve that money now?”

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile: “All right.”

Song Jiazi went behind the counter and took out a pouch of immortal coins. Chen Ping’an did not count them and tucked them straight into his sleeve.

He thought for a moment and took one of the shop’s books that Ning Yao had selected — a Rest-Assured Collection — as a gift.

Without much idle chat, Chen Ping’an departed; the couple escorted them to the door. Some dispersed to continue wandering the market; others returned to their shop and customers. The couple exhaled in relief — finally they’d repaid principal and interest. Though Chen Ping’an’s lifesaving favor could not be repaid with a pouch of coins, they could only hold the debt of his kindness long in their hearts and pray more for the unnamed daoist couple who had saved them when they burned incense at the Swaying River.

After shopping, Ning Yao, Pei Qian and the others continued selecting items. Chen Ping’an stood at the doorway.

Ghost Ravine had two northbound roads leading respectively to Qinglu and Lanshe towns — one dangerous with winding mountains and many chances, the other safer and better for sightseeing.

Chen Ping’an chose the Qinglu route and never went to Lanshe.

He was familiar with Funichi City and Tongxiu City; in the latter he had once traded, putting on the face of an old immortal master and selling trinkets to a female ghost shopkeeper named Zhengguan and to the town lord’s self-styled “deputy chancellor” sister. He had sold many things taken from Mount Diyong, and his Bag Pavilion business had arguably started there. Now, looking back, Tongxiu City had a fitting name.

Outside Ghost Ravine’s spirit-city lords there were those “great demons” once called the Six Saints — their titles and nicknames were all fearsome.

The Beguiling Empress of Boluo Mountain, the Dust-Banishing Primordial Lord of Dìyǒng Mountain, the Great Thunder Marshal of Jixiao Mountain, the Great Demon Catcher of the Filthy-Water Grotto, the Mountain-Moving Great Sage — the Black River King…

On the street there appeared a thin little spirit that could barely form human shape, carrying a large basket filled with herbs, earth glues and rare stones from Ghost Ravine, hoping to exchange them for money to buy books.

It came from Yangchang Palace, where the Demon-Catching Great Immortal dwelt. Now that Pima Sect did not bar the strange spirits’ coming and going, they only had to hang a sign like a roll call and they would be recorded.

Chen Ping’an folded his sleeves and stood at the shop door amid the bustle. He immediately recognized the little gate-spirit from Yangchang Palace and called out.

The mouse spirit zipped over — skinny as a bamboo pole — and cried in delight, “Sword-Immortal sir?!”

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded. “Long time no see. Here for books?”

It nodded: “Yes, but they’re expensive.”

It did not dare go far.

This market crowded with immortals was not a place to buy books cheaply.

Chen Ping’an smiled: “When the world is more peaceful again you can walk north along the Swaying River — books will be cheaper in some market towns.”

He bent and rummaged through the mouse spirit’s basket and asked, “How much would you get for these?”

Its various items were neatly arranged to allow more things in the basket. Like when Chen Ping’an as a child picked mulberry leaves and pressed them; one basket seemed to hold a thousand pounds.

The spirit perked up: “At the best market years I could sell two or three snow-flower coins! The shopkeeper was kind and sometimes gave a little small silver.”

It came only every three to five months. Now business was bad and it would get one snow-flower coin.

The shopkeeper set the price; it did not bargain nor intend to.

Chen Ping’an rubbed his brows and laughed: “Which shop took your goods and fed them to the dog? Who dares do business like that — not afraid one night they’ll put you in a sack on a dark road?”

Ghost Ravine’s dense yin over centuries had steeped things so that a whole basket of items should not sell for two or three snow-flower coins. The shopkeeper must be taking advantage of the naive mouse spirit.

Ghost Ravine, aside from the factional city-states, had local powers such as Yangchang Palace, Jixiao Mountain and the Beguiling Empress of Cool Shelter — local heroes who occupied hills and raised rouses. The mouse spirit’s affiliation with Yangchang Palace allowed it to go many places; with a little business sense it could have saved up a few small-heat coins.

It smiled: “Sword-Immortal — it’s all right. I just run more and carry more — I make a bit and don’t ask for more. At home there’s no big expense.”

Chen Ping’an nodded: “That’s a good attitude.”

Lowering its voice, it asked: “Sword-Immortal — are you a true sword-immortal today?”

Chen Ping’an smiled and squinted, then nodded: “Sort of.”

It immediately said, “Then wait for me — after I sell these I’ll prepare a congratulatory gift for you.”

Chen Ping’an waved his hand: “No need.”

From nearby Chen Ping’an picked out a few fine volumes and handed them to the little spirit. “For you.”

The spirit felt embarrassed but a sword-immortal’s gift of books could not be refused — it would regret it at home — so it accepted and wiped itself off, then eagerly took the books.

Pei Qian and the others continued to browse. Ning Yao stood by the doorway watching Chen Ping’an’s profile — his expression was gentle, like a jar of homebrewed sticky-rice wine.

Chen Ping’an smiled: “I have a suggestion — want to hear?”

The mouse spirit straightened and puffed up: “Sword-Immortal — speak freely!”

Some passersby overheard the “sword-immortal” title and turned curious. A gang of burly, coarse men gave hostile looks. “This little soft-face in a blue robe with cloth shoes and a sword thinks he’s a mountain-sword immortal? Who does he think he is — Liu Jinglong or Liu Zhiqing? Skin-deep, would be blown over by wind — what a sickly little man. Let’s teach him a lesson.”

Chen Ping’an glanced askance: “Lookin’ at what?”

One burly man sneered, “What’s it to you?”

In that instant a slight chill prickled the space between their brows.

The man saw a flying sword hovering before him and immediately clasped his fists: “Father! I’m off!” The group of jianghu fighters strode away in big steps.

Chen Ping’an sheathed the imitation sword of Mount Hèn and resumed talking to the little spirit with a smile: “Next time you have a basket full, go to Qinglu Town first. I’ll introduce you to someone — maybe Du Wensi or Yang Lin. They’re my friends. Do business with one of them. Sell half the basket, keep the rest, then come back and set a firm price: one snow-flower coin.”

The mouse spirit hesitated, embarrassed, fingers twisting its sleeve, then mustered courage: “Sword-Immortal — that sounds too troublesome.”

It couldn’t say why, but it simply did not want such complication. Yet knowing the sword-immortal wished well for it made it even more ashamed.

Chen Ping’an did not seem surprised and smiled, nodding: “So keep doing it as you do.”

“Okay!”

Once there had also been a youth who declined an old gentleman who liked drinking, and so did not become that man’s disciple.

So today another little fellow refused a sword-immortal’s kindness. So what? It’s fine.

Chen Ping’an asked: “Do you know what readers fear most?”

It shook its head — it had read very few books.

Chen Ping’an said: “Reading too much.”

The spirit was more puzzled.

He explained: “When you have many books, it’s harder to read each with the same careful attention as when you only have a few. And when you read a lot you understand many principles, and principles can clash with principles until in the end you have no firm principle. So when you read, remember those two things.”

It said, “I don’t get it!”

Chen Ping’an laughed and patted its shoulder: “Don’t worry if you don’t understand — worry if you don’t think. The thing the world should most ‘borrow and never return’ is reading. You can’t give all knowledge back to the sages. Go buy books — I won’t come with you. If you ever meet a difficulty you can’t bear alone, go to Qinglu Town and find Pima Sect cultivators; tell them you know Chen Ping’an and that you are good friends.”

It scratched its head: “Those immortals — why would they believe me?”

Chen Ping’an said: “Some will.”

It nodded hard: “I’ll remember.”

The little spirit backed away, basket on its back, and waved farewell to the sword-immortal who watched it.

But not long after it rushed back to Chen Ping’an with the basket emptied and a small unassuming object in hand — a yellow eelskin inkstone roughly fit for a mountain. The inscription read: “Understand Reason, Practice Earnestly.”

Chen Ping’an accepted the gift and asked, smiling: “How much did that cost?”

It wiped sweat from its brow and beamed, “Just one snow-flower coin.”

Chen Ping’an immediately guessed the little fellow had run up a tab with the unscrupulous shopkeeper. He said nothing and they parted.

Ning Yao grew more curious. It seemed that after the bout with Cao Ci, seeing the time-picture scroll aboard the Night Ferry, and then meeting this little spirit in the market today, Chen Ping’an’s whole bearing lightened — yet deeper inwardly his spirit, sword-intent and punch-intent all steadily rose.

Chen Ping’an told Ning Yao: “I’ll go into Ghost Ravine alone — to a nearby place. I’ll be quick — you don’t need to follow. The toll at Pima Sect’s arch is a ripoff.”

Ning Yao didn’t mind. She could take Pei Qian to browse more shops and buy a few chosen items.

The place Chen Ping’an suddenly wanted to visit was not far; beyond Crow Ridge but still far from Qinglu Town.

It was a cliff with an iron-chain bridge paved with wooden planks — ordinary scholars could cross it.

Last time he had passed the bridge it had been shabbily ruined, occupied by a pitch-black python and a spirit with a woman’s head spinning webs to catch passing mountain birds.

After the upheaval in Ghost Ravine, those creatures had immediately submitted to Funichi City. Having obtained a talisman of protection they built a thatch hut at one end of the bridge and pretended to occupy a shabby little domain of cultivation.

Chen Ping’an had once spent a night there.

At leisure then, two mountain sprites timidly approached him on the bridge.

They were frightened but there was an unconscious corpse of a black-robed scholar on the ground; someone had stripped that corpse of his robe and taken several talismans — glowing treasures obvious even to a fool.

Before their escape, Good Brother and Wood Mao Brother became fast friends; brothers in spirit, they scavenged money together.

At the cliff a hut door opened and two figures came out: a black-robed broad man, muscular and sturdy, and a vermilion-clad woman of alluring looks — both grotto-realm beings barely able to assume human shape; their faces, limbs and skin still betrayed their origins.

When Gao Cheng left Ghost Ravine that time, his departure was enigmatic, as if dissipating a fortune; however fate is uneven and even ones with little luck could, in that “mountains-and-rivers change” event, break their bottleneck and ascend to mid-five realm — it seemed a tiny lucky clutch did so, including those two bridge spirits.

They flashed across the bridge, knelt before Chen Ping’an and kowtowed deeply.

“Bridge Keeper paying respects to benefactor.”

“Jun-Xiu paying respects to benefactor.”

Chen Ping’an smiled wryly and shook his head: “We only traded casual talk about cultivation that night — I’m no benefactor. Go cultivate well and repay the world’s nurture.”

When they rose, the blue-robed sword-immortal had already gone.

Back at the market gate Chen Ping’an found Ning Yao finishing the Rest-Assured Collection. She shut the book and her first question was, “On the road to Qinglu Town, is there a Funichi City nearby?”

The book had mentioned it; Chen Ping’an’s own travel notes had a few sparse jottings, but the episode had not been large — only a few lines.

Seeing Ning Yao take it to heart, Chen Ping’an grew uneasy and so recounted the early days in Ghost Ravine: at Crow Ridge he had encountered one of Funichi City’s four major ghost entities, a white-clad female ghost called Bai Aiqing by the city-lord Fan Yunluo. That ghost had been half-made-up, once a concubine of a general; later Fan Yunluo — the self-styled Rouge Marquis, a royal princess’s heroic spirit in life — had ridden a bejeweled imperial carriage in childlike appearance; the two sides had clashed violently and become sworn enemies.

If not for swordman Pu Rang, Chen Ping’an might have pursued them to Funichi City and wiped them out.

Ning Yao listened and suddenly asked, “Why don’t you write more notes about these exciting landscapes and stories?”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Are they exciting?”

The white-haired child said: “If Hidden Lord ancestor says it’s exciting, then it’s exciting; if he says it’s not, then it’s not. Hidden Lord ancestor — do you think it’s exciting?”

Pei Qian blinked and said nothing.

Xiao Mili elbowed outward and nodded vigorously: “Exciting beyond reason — chaotic and twisty!”

Sigh. This good mountain-lord is clever but sometimes foolish; if I help you now, later how do I go to Ning Sister to help you without blame? Then when I try to speak fair it’ll seem untrustworthy.

Chen Ping’an listened to everyone’s views, smiled and said: “Then next time I have such landscape-stories I’ll be sure to write more — spare no ink.”

They left Skeleton Shoal and rode the wind toward Suijia City of Yinp­ing State.

On the way they passed Moonlight Mountain and the Golden Glint Peak — apparently those mountain sprites had deep fortunes and had cultivated beside Li Xisheng for many years.

Pei Qian had once travelled north with Li Huai and the fox spirit Wei Taizhen and had visited Du Yu at the Demon-Carving Palace. That respected “three-yield” elder Du wasn’t on the mountain then; Chen Ping’an did not plan to go there now — Du Yu’s temperament surely preferred the open road of jianghu to mountain life.

At Suijia City the Fire God Temple’s incense burned strong.

The northern city god’s temple had just received a new city-god.

The bearded man of the Fire God Shrine — after stepping free from his gilded statue — remained much the same; twenty years passed in a blink for an ancient river-and-land deity.

Chen Ping’an drank with the bearded god and heard the news that the incense at Tiaoxi and Shaoxi channel-shrines had improved; the new channel-mistress of Tiaoxi was a heroic female spirit and even the bearded god thought it fortunate for the populace. Hearing this, Chen Ping’an decided not to visit Cangyun Lake to inspect the new dragon seat.

The bearded deity joked by mind-voice: “Chen Sword-Immortal — your eye for brides is good. Pretty, taciturn, polite, virtuous.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and, a bit tipsy, answered in mind-voice: “Oh come now — on the road people expect me to be head of a household; I mind the outside, she minds the home.”

The wine made him pleasantly merry.

They left Suijia City and Chen Ping’an dispersed the wine’s scent from his person.

Ning Yao smiled: “I didn’t even get a toast from him — polite, was he?”

Chen Ping’an played deaf.

When they reached Dumb Lake in Baoxiang State’s Yellow-Wind Valley and landed, Pei Qian said: “Such a big lake?”

Zhou Mili hopped and laughed. The little girl had missed her homeland. Hearing Pei Qian call it Dumb Lake, Xiao Mili was delighted.

In fact Pei Qian had been there before.

The white-haired child rolled his eyes — he always refused to say dishonorable things, too embarrassed.

Suddenly he noticed the Hidden Lord ancestor glanced his way and patted the short, round Xiao Mili’s head, smiling: “Xiao Mili, with such a big place, won’t you have a thousand-strong army of shrimp and crab soldiers? Come on, issue an edict — shout them out — make me see it. But fair warning — if you scare me I want compensation.”

Xiao Mili scratched her cheek, shy: “No no — I’m all alone in the world.”

Chen Ping’an walked by the water and involuntarily thought of that young escortsman he had once met.

That man was now close to fifty — a jianghu person. Twenty years had passed; the young jianghu of old might now have white hair.

Moonlight was quiet and the waves shimmered like scattered snow-flower coins.

They strolled by the lakeside arm in arm; Xiao Mili’s hands hung over Chen Ping’an’s arm and their feet swung. She laughed loudly.

Chen Ping’an lingered on purpose and they stayed that night. Xiao Mili dragged the white-haired child into Dumb Lake to “wander the jianghu” and made a ruckus.

The same moonlight shone over the nine continents.

Spring Dew Garden and Night Grass Hall.

Song Lanqiao, finally with time, came by to find Tang Xi and drink.

Two troubled brothers — each unable to speak with their masters without being scolded; reason did not hold. One floundered over at their master’s house and could not avoid being scolded; the other at Spring Dew Garden had less comeuppance but still hit a soft spot.

Add those who stir trouble for mischief, and these two old hands who are used to business and social affairs are tired.

So in recent years these two who sit in the rear of Spring Dew Garden’s patriarchal hall often gather to drink quietly.

Though they had little private friendship, in a cup now and then they found some comradeship.

Not long ago Tang Xi had gotten a secret tip: Luopo Mountain’s young mountain-lord — who seemed to have vanished for over twenty years like a submerged ox — had returned home.

Moreover rumors said Luopo Mountain had been elevated to a sect.

But they had not invited any of Spring Dew Garden to that ceremony.

There was an ominous sense of rain before the storm.

Song Lanqiao lifted his cup and gulped, sitting cross-legged: “You’re not bad. At least you’ve kept that little Ant Shop going; slow and steady incense. He’s sentimental and won’t do you wrong.”

Tang Xi sighed gloomily: “Who runs business like that? A beautiful opening gambit messed up by his own people. Helpless.”

Song Lanqiao rolled his eyes: “Go tell my master, then.”

Tang Xi laughed: “Then you go plead to Patriarch Tan?”

They met each other’s eyes and laughed, clinking cups — bittersweet.

Song Lanqiao sighed: “Such a young sect head. Next time I meet that kid I’ll be tongue-tied.”

Spring Dew Garden had plotted for years to achieve the “sect” rank; the mountain master patriarch, the nascent-soul female cultivator Tan Ling, had exhausted effort. Yet still they had not been raised to a sect.

Tang Xi grinned: “Old men like us get by with a drink.”
