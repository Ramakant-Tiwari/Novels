Song Lanqiao laughed heartily: “Then let’s go for it.”

By dawn, at Dumb Lake, the group continued on their journey.

When they reached the gate of Jinwu Palace, Pei Qian announced their arrival; the gate cultivator soon went to inform the hall — there were distinguished guests from the Grandmaster’s line, and the ancestral hall and Xueqiao Peak must be notified.

Having outsiders entertained by Liu Zhiqing used to be no small matter at Jinwu Palace.

After all, the palace lord’s little grand-uncle was famous for having no friends and almost never received guests.

Within the sect it was said that this senior, who holds the highest rank and cultivation, seemed to be very close with the new sect leader of Taihui Sword Sect.

The elder had rarely descended the mountain before, and when he did it was alongside that sect-leader sword-immortal — they had exchanged blades several times, each time ruthless.

And he once met a wandering young sword-immortal at Spring Dew Garden’s Yuying Cliff — a swordsman named Chen, as far as people could tell.

Pei Qian bowed respectfully and greeted him, calling him “Mr. Liu.”

Last time at Jinwu Palace, Liu Zhiqing had been like a schoolmaster or senior family elder; he’d even asked Pei Qian closely about the copying she’d done, and then told her, “Your handwriting is slightly better than your master’s.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and introduced, “Ning Yao.”

Liu Zhiqing was greatly surprised; he quickly collected himself, made a one-handed sword seal salute, and said solemnly, “Liu Zhiqing of Jinwu Palace greets Sword-Immortal Ning.”

Ning Yao returned the salute with clasped fists: “Greetings, Mr. Liu.”

Calling him “Sword-Immortal Liu” might feel awkward. Not to mention the customs around Sword Qi City: Ning Yao herself is a flying-ascension–level swordswoman; to call a yuanxian (nascent soul) swordsman “sword-immortal” could make both parties uncomfortable.

Chen Ping’an shook his head inwardly, privately thinking this fellow was no match for him.

When he was at Longxu River’s blacksmith shop near Liu Xianyang — and met She Yue — what would he have called them?

And when Liu Zhiqing saw Ning Yao, wouldn’t he at least call her “sister-in-law”? You’d think he’d accept the courtesy of rank.

Liu Zhiqing glanced at the white-haired child.

Chen Ping’an’s mind-voice: “Not appropriate to say more.”

Liu Zhiqing understood, nodded, and asked no further.

A flying-ascension transformed outsider demon — her true name, her ties to Qingming world, the Year-End Palace’s Wu Shuangjiang, her partner, the fourteen-stage 合道 (conjunction) opportunity… any mention of such would be the top taboo on the mountain.

The white-haired child waited a long time, saw the Hidden Lord Ancestor chat with friends yet not mention him in the least, and sat despondent on a bench, head down, boot tapping boot.

Chen Ping’an laughed: “Come down the mountain with me? I hear Liu Jinglong is in Beiku Luzhou now, swaggering about, famed for his unrivaled drinking capacity. I alone fear him; with you there, I’ll persuade him to drink, you’ll block his cups — we’ll take a bite out of his table’s swagger!”

Liu Zhiqing chuckled, “No, I must close myself off to train my sword.”

Chen Ping’an continued to persuade: “Train what? No need to rush. We’re only a single realm apart — it’s negligible.”

Liu Zhiqing smiled: “I won’t see you off, then.”

Chen Ping’an threw an arm around Liu Zhiqing’s shoulder and rubbed it in, “Oh, so grand — so you bully me for not being a nascent-soul swordsman?”

Liu Zhiqing lifted his hand, fingers together, pushed Chen Ping’an’s arm aside.

Chen Ping’an stopped smiling and said in earnest: “On a serious note, in the coming years I plan to travel Middle Earth; I’ll call Liu Jinglong. How about the three of us go together?”

Long ago at a ferry near Spring Dew Garden he and Liu Jinglong had agreed to travel together through Middle Earth.

Liu Zhiqing shook his head: “I won’t descend the mountain until I reach the Yupuo realm. If I break through, the first place I go won’t be Middle Earth. I hope it won’t be too late.”

If he truly couldn’t break his bottleneck, then he’d have to go as a yuanxian swordsman to the ruins of Sword Qi City and then fly-sword south.

Chen Ping’an thought, then nodded: “Then break through early. Maybe we’ll have the chance to travel to the Savage World together.”

Back at Spring Dew Garden, Chen Ping’an separated from Ning Yao and went alone to visit the elderly woman Lin Cuo’e — Song Lanqiao’s mentor.

He still offered the junior’s courtesy and visited, and with no impatience chatted with the old woman for a long while. Lin Cuo’e, who once scolded anyone in the ancestral hall without blinking, softened into a kindly elder upon seeing Chen Ping’an. She sat and took his hand, asking about his travels, whether he had been tired, why he looked thin, scolding that he had not sent a letter back to Spring Dew Garden and that it made people worry; she wished to meet his good companions — if he had them — to see them, or if not, to hurry to find them…

The old woman walked Chen Ping’an all the way to the mountain foot.

So Chen Ping’an’s visit to Spring Dew Garden only included seeing her one person.

The ferry manager Song Lanqiao, the wealth god Tang Xi, mountain master Tan Ling — none were seen.

When Chen Ping’an left and it was discovered that this young swordsman and head of a sect had come and gone, the ancestral hall at Spring Dew Garden immediately convened an emergency meeting.

A blue-robed figure stood at a seaside ferry, wind on his face, temple hair lifted, sleeves fluttering.

Moon in the sky, waves on the sea, a blue robe in the mortal world.

Jian Lai — Chapter 810: Teaching Boxing

If it weren’t for a business matter to discuss, Chen Ping’an would never have gone to bother the Caique Mansion cultivators at Peach Blossom Ferry, interrupting their making of ceremonial robes; that would mean delaying Luopo Mountain’s earning. Don’t cross money with me.

Caique Mansion is located in the Water Xiao State of the Lake-and-Marsh Kingdom. The state and its capital are built upon islands; Caique Mansion sits where a great lake and ravine meet, the stream called Peach Blossom Water. Above Peach Blossom Ferry white clouds linger year-round, crowning the green hills where Caique Mansion sits like a snowy diadem. Mountains and waters correspond; clouds circle; peach blossoms fill the hills — the scenery is stunning.

Mi Yu once “cultivated” here for many years and allegedly left a heap of romantic debts; does that spoil Luopo Mountain’s reputation?

Chen Ping’an silently noted it and resolved to talk it over with the great sword-immortal Mi when he returned to Luopo Mountain.

At the foot of the mountain there’s a teahouse run by Caique Mansion; business was usually slow because the tea was expensive — travelers on Peach Blossom Ferry tended to stroll the peach grove instead.

After the group sat, Chen Ping’an and his companions announced themselves. The female cultivators, hearing the young sect head of Luopo Mountain was present, did not dare be remiss and immediately sent a paper-kite message to the ancestral hall — Caique cultivators all knew that Luopo Mountain, though a relatively recent sect, had become very wealthy and was now a sect in name too.

Caique Mansion’s present prosperity owed much to Luopo Mountain providing that “patriarchal” ceremonial robe, enabling them to branch and prosper; thanks to that treasure they linked with the Dayuan Song clan and did business, rising rapidly within twenty years into a top Beiku Luzhou mountain. If Caique had not strictly followed tradition by taking only female disciples and kept its disciple numbers low, it might well have vied for the “sect” rank.

The Belt-Chief Wugun quickly took to the wind and arrived. On meeting, he first apologized: the mansion lord Sun Qing had taken his direct disciple Liu Guibao out on a journey. Sun Qing called it an expedition to protect his disciple on the road, but actually it was an excuse to make another trip to Taihui Sword Sect.

By mountain custom, a sect head of Chen’s standing arriving — and being a financial backer behind Caique Mansion — required Sun Qing’s presence.

Even if Luopo Mountain had sent a flying-sword message in advance, Caique still owed formalities.

Caique knew Luopo Mountain’s foundation and strength very well: two words — unreasonable.

After Sun Qing and Liu Guibao observed the rites and returned, Sun Qing privately joked with Wugun, saying they couldn’t find a single earth-immortal among Luopo Mountain’s people; those nascent-soul types there seemed unable to speak up. As if anyone not an earth-immortal embarrassed to greet others.

Wugun at first listened to Sun Qing’s account of the ceremony’s guest list and was stunned, speechless.

Wugun saw a woman in a snow-white robe with a long sword case on her back.

Ning Yao introduced herself the same as before: “Ning Yao, swordswoman.”

Wugun clasped his fists and greeted, laughing: “I am Wugun, head of ritual at Caique Mansion, “Zhi Ge Wu” — Mountain Lord Qun.”

Wait.

A swordsman? Ning Yao?

Could she possibly be Ning Yao from Sword Qi City?

Until Sun Qing joined that ceremonial audience did they know that the loafer in Caique Mansion — “Yu Mi” — was actually a Yupuo–realm sword-immortal from Sword Qi City, whose true name was Mi Yu; his elder brother Mi Hu was a great sword-immortal of renown.

Is there such coincidence in the world? Chen Ping’an indeed was remarkable; Wugun didn’t believe he could have persuaded Ning Yao to follow him.

Besides, Ning Yao had ascended to the Flying-Ascension City’s fifth heaven; with the Wenmiao’s rules there, how could she be here in Haoran world?

Did she fly-sword ascend?

This illustrates the difference between Haoran mountain sect peaks and second-rate immortal houses. Moreover, Caique Mansion had no swordsmen and had never been to Sword Qi City; add that Haoran’s scenic reports had been suppressed for years, so Wugun still didn’t know how much authority the mountain head in the inverted mountain and the Spring Banner Zhai had once wielded.

But Wugun secretly indulged hope: if it were true, she tentatively asked, “Where is Miss Ning from?”

Ning Yao said, “Sword Qi City.”

Wugun’s face flushed crimson.

Beiku Luzhou is the one of Haoran’s nine continents that has the best relationship with Sword Qi City — no contest. So cultivators here, even non-swordsmen, know much about Sword Qi City.

Wugun personally brewed tea to receive them, hands trembling from excitement and unable to calm down. The tea was Caique Mansion’s back-mountain specialty called Little Xuanbi; the old tea trees numbered only twelve. Rare birds picked the leaves and secret methods shaped them into cakes, making them precious.

Wugun couldn’t help glancing at Ning Yao again and again.

Ning Yao truly was the legendary Ning Yao.

Across the great peaks of Beiku Luzhou, everyone guessed and opined the same: Ning Yao would be the new number-one person in this fresh world — and she was a woman. Wugun, drinking with the mansion lord and Liu Guibao, would certainly discuss Ning Yao. In particular, the haughty Liu Guibao admired Ning Yao.

When it came to swordsmen, one could not ignore Ning Yao — just as one cannot omit Pei Bei and Cao Ci among pure martial folk in Haoran world.

Xiao Mili took the teacup with both hands and whispered to Short Pumpkin: “Sip slowly, don’t gulp.”

The white-haired child, shocked: “There’s an etiquette to drinking tea? Where’d you learn that, Xiao Mili?”

Xiao Mili took a sip with both hands and nodded in satisfaction: “Self-taught.”

Chen Ping’an held his cup, gently rotated it, eyes smiling; cool breeze, pleasant mood. Outside the teahouse the lake was a mirror; peach blossoms cascaded up the hills in shades of light and deep, like a fair maid’s layered makeup.

Because Chen Ping’an needed to discuss business, after Ning Yao had her tea she excused herself to inspect the weaving at the Tianyi Workshop, letting Pei Qian lead the way to view Caique Mansion’s seamstresses making ceremonial robes.

While Ning Yao was there, Wugun remained nervous; when Ning Yao left she felt reluctant.

Wugun privately asked Chen Ping’an by mind-voice: “May I ask Miss Ning’s cultivation level?”

Chen Ping’an smiled: “Currently flying-ascension level.”

Wugun filled her cup and downed it at a tilt. Hosting today, she’d suffered a loss: once the young sect head had that swordswoman at his side, she dared not host the way she would have before.

The white-haired child stayed behind and swore to assist his old ancestor.

Chen Ping’an didn’t think she exaggerated. As for making ceremonial robes, Wu Shuangjiang’s partner, that heart-magic (xinmo) was top-notch.

Chen Ping’an moved directly to business: “Before coming here I attended the Wenmiao council. Caique Mansion’s robes have been recorded as candidates. If selected, it’s a huge contract. Merchants, artisans, and method-people will keep evaluating. Whether it succeeds or not, Luopo Mountain and the Dayuan Song clan will get a missive from Wenmiao asking to congratulate Caique in future.”

He took out a manuscript — a hand-copied recipe from Jincui City for fabric forging — the formula had come from Manhuang Taoting, and pushed it gently to Wugun. “The robes’ rank can keep improving. Later have Caique detail the required heavenly and earthly materials for the robes. The more detailed the list, the better. I’ll help search across Beiku Luzhou for suitable immortal peaks.”

The white-haired child mind-voiced: “May I take a look?”

With Chen Ping’an’s permission he stood on tiptoe, grabbed the manuscript, and as he flipped it the essence of the Peach Blossom Stream condensed: a green-hued brush appeared; a few peach petals fluttered down onto the table. Using the tip like an ink-dip, he began to write red annotations and tiny characters across the margins — prescriptions and suggestions densely filling the blank page, quickly doubling the book’s written content.

Wugun was shaken to the core by this scene.

Immortal hand-script, Dao-qi floating!

She asked in heart-voice: “Sect Head, who is this elder?”

Chen Ping’an smiled: “A new miscellaneous disciple of Luopo Mountain — first go check shops in Qilong Lane, pass the test, and then be entered into Jise Peak’s pedigree.”

Wugun thought Chen was joking about the elder’s identity not being revealed.

The white-haired child lifted his head; his eyes flashed with seven-colored glazed hues — some past-lives, some rank — and he mouthed something that made people bristle.

Chen Ping’an bent two fingers and delivered a light smack.

The white-haired child suppressed his patrolling secret-art. If it weren’t for the Hidden Lord Ancestor’s presence, he might have stealthily checked Wugun’s entire ancestry, then dip his brush again — the peach petal’s red would fade a bit — and busily write while trading with the Hidden Lord Ancestor: “Fill in what’s missing, record a merit.”

Chen Ping’an grinned: “Earlier you accidentally said ‘loss’ when talking about profit — was that recorded in Pei Qian’s ledger as offset, or do we keep separate accounting?”

The white-haired child heaved a sigh and chose offset.

“This time at the Wenmiao council, your Sanlang Temple’s spirit-armors and the Laojun Lane robes have been formally selected.”

Chen Ping’an and Wugun discussed council backstage matters: the ferry types had been classified into very detailed ranks: massive mountain ferries, sword-ships for attack, high-speed drifting boats, all adopted by Wenmiao. Soon across Haoran different places will start constructing seven types of ferries including sword-ships.

As for ceremonial robes, Caique Mansion was at a slight disadvantage on price, so even suggestions from Dayuan’s Song Changjing carried more weight than most monarchs or cultivators. Wenmiao had only provisionally listed them as candidates.

The crafting across Beiku Luzhou’s mountains was impressive: Sanlang Temple’s spirit armor, Hèn Sword Mountain’s imitation swords, Buddhism Light Temple’s tricolor kasaya, Dayuan Chongxuan Office’s crane cloaks — if not counting rank but only sales, Laojun Lane’s robes dominated the continent. Especially the Yingran robe and Dayue armor — one for upper-five realm cultivators, one tailored for emperors — they weren’t for mass sales. Before getting Jincui City’s robe-forging method, Caique’s robe craft wasn’t top-tier.

The white-haired child waved his sleeve, the jade brush in hand, the pale peach petals on the table drifted into the water. He made a stance of qi-sinking-to-dan-tian: “Great work completed.”

Chen Ping’an skimmed the manuscript once more and returned it to Wugun, reminding her: “Guard this book carefully. When Sun the mansion lord returns, send only a copy to the Dayuan Song clan; they’ll forward it to Wenmiao. Caique’s chances of filling the ‘gap’ will grow. If Wenmiao nods, Caique’s robes might be ordered in quantities starting at two thousand pieces. Robes are consumables — once battlefield tests verify them, and one model among ten stands out, orders will pour in. Most important is Caique gaining renown across Haoran, then business can expand to Middle Earth and Aiai Continent.”

Wugun’s heart swayed at the thought.

Chen Ping’an poured a bucket of cold water: “Besides taking disciples, Caique must prioritize adding a fifth-stage offering or guest official. Big trees invite thieves; be ever watchful.”

Wugun replied helplessly: “Who doesn’t want that? Our mansion lord planned cleverly: if he marries Liu the gentleman, he gets both a spouse and a mountain patron. But Liu doesn’t agree. Asking Pima Sect for a named guest-official isn’t hard, but to have an elder-ancestor permanently stationed here is unrealistic.”

But Sun Qing’s fondness for Taihui Sword Sect’s Liu Jinglong was known on the continent — this actually served as a protective talisman for Caique. If someone picked a fight with Caique, Liu Jinglong, a man who loved to argue reason, would surely descend with sword in hand — not for love, but to air out principles.

But once Caique’s business grew large enough to tempt envy, that connection might not be sufficient anymore.

Wugun smiled wryly: “Chen Sect Head, don’t assume Caique is so rich as Luopo Mountain. We’re not of equal scope.”

Chen Ping’an thought a moment: “I’ll think of ways to help, though I can’t promise success.”

Having an elder permanently stationed would be best, but not the only option.

For example, the boundary-stopping martial man Wang Fusu, if he publicly claimed to be Caique’s chief guest-official, would give would-be raiders pause. Wang Fusu’s punches were famously governed solely by mood.

Another suitable elder could be the Lion Peak mountain master he’d dealt with before.

Whether either elder would agree — unknown, but worth trying. If repeatedly rebuffed, call on Canal Duke Shen Lin and Dragon Pavilion Marquis Li Yuan for help. Owe one favor, owe two.

Master Guo Chi Zhu Quan had recently visited Pima Sect’s homeland in Middle Earth and then stepped down as sect leader; the top chair was temporarily empty. He no longer liked attending ancestral hall deliberations; he waited for Du Wensi to break his bottleneck to Yupuo and then succeed him. Rumor had it Zhu Quan laughed openly in the ancestral hall, saying, “I’m unburdened now; I’ll cut whomever I please.”

Still, Zhu Quan and Aiai Continent’s Xie Songhua made Chen Ping’an uneasy — after all, they were not ones to be out-talked, even in coarse speech.

Wugun rose solemnly and clasped hands to thank him; in a much better mood, she spoke more freely: “I know Chen Sect Head is upright and pure-hearted. Otherwise I would have, on your first exception, called a few Caique disciples to lug in wine and drink with you!”

Chen Ping’an’s face darkened.

The white-haired child glanced more kindly at Wugun.

Wugun sat down again and said: “Luopo Mountain helped Yunshang City build a private ferry. I heard Spring Dew Garden objected?”

She heard Spring Dew Garden’s cultivators once demanded Luopo Mountain move the ferry’s site to a subordinate mountain of Spring Dew Garden — a lot of immortal coin for a small Yunshang City. Chen Ping’an nodded: “Human greed is no surprise. If not for internal quarreling in Spring Dew Garden’s ancestral hall, Luopo Mountain wouldn’t have to have any dealings with them.”

Wugun laughed: “I’m not trying to stir trouble.”

After a pause she laughed out loud: “Alright, I admit — I’ve taken some schadenfreude.”

The white-haired child sat obediently beside the Hidden Lord, eyeing this woman who was plain-looking but pleasant-tempered.

Wugun asked: “Has Chen Sect Head visited Spring Dew Garden yet?”

Chen Ping’an nodded: “I only saw Elder Lin.”

Wugun was greatly surprised. Initially thinking the young sect head was headstrong, she grew increasingly astonished as she pondered. Finally, she looked at Chen Ping’an with altered expression. Young as he was, how could he read people so well? Then again, perhaps only such insight could make one a young sect head.

Wugun asked: “How is Luanluan’s cultivation going?”

Chen Ping’an smiled: “Good talent; I worry about wasting her prospects.”

Wugun shook her head and clicked her tongue: “That comment deserves a smack.”

Zhao Shuxia had become Chen Ping’an’s direct disciple and Zhao Luan became Luopo Mountain’s Jise Peak pedigree cultivator, so she did not return to Caique to continue trainings. Chen Ping’an had just found her an anonymous master — the transformed outsider demon at his side.

Looking out to the peach blossoms, Chen Ping’an recalled traveling with Wei Xian and Lu Baixiang once through a peach grove; an ordinary village girl had passed, and the old cook, touched by the scene, had blurted some lines that Pei Qian teased him about for ages.

Actually Zhu Xian’s offhand words were amusing to Chen Ping’an.

Lovely deep red, light red, emerald dress coy glances — what does it mean? Fate blooms when you plant peach blossoms in a heart.

Chen Ping’an remembered Zhu Xian removing his mask and cursed inwardly. Wei Bo, Mi Yu, and Cao Ci, Fu Jin — none of them compared to the old cook.

He recalled how Pei Qian once laughed until her stomach hurt at the old cook’s tales. Chen Ping’an had laughed a good deal too.

Before leaving, Wugun gave them a few jars of Little Xuanbi tea and said, on setting the new robe’s price: put everyone’s minds at ease — just break even.

Chen Ping’an smiled: “Don’t aim only to break even. Since this is business, even with Wenmiao, money should be made. Let both sides earn less.”

Wugun shook her head: “For this, we’ll not profit a single snow-flower coin. Caique Mansion will take no gain on robes Wenmiao requires.”

None of Caique’s cultivators had been to Sword Qi City. Getting the chance would make Wugun extra proud when she returned to the ancestral hall to honor past founders.

Chen Ping’an teased: “Then how will Luopo Mountain survive? Joining Caique to not profit?”

Wugun lost for words.

Chen Ping’an clasped his fists and smiled: “Then let it be so decided.”

Finally the head ritualist looked to the immortal couple standing side by side and joked to Chen Ping’an and Ning Yao: “May you have a son early.”

Ning Yao was taken aback; she hesitated and said nothing — nodding seemed wrong, shaking her head too was off.

Chen Ping’an smiled faintly, as if he’d heard but hadn’t.

He immediately thought Caique’s matter of guests and patrons was small; “Leave it to me,” he said. “Ms. Wugun, just await the good news.”

Leaving Peach Blossom Ferry they went to Yunshang City where city lord Shen Zhenze, and his partners Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan were present.

They took a ferry to inspect the immortal ferry Luopo Mountain financed and Yunshang City provided land and manpower for. It wasn’t large, a little smaller than Caique’s Peach Blossom Ferry.

But possessing a private ferry showed a sect’s depth; like whether a major sect could found a branch — the logic was the same.

Chen Ping’an said he must press on, and Shen Zhenze did not detain him. If it had been only Chen Ping’an, they’d drink a round; but with the swordswoman Ning Yao present, Shen Zhenze dared not.

Returning to familiar streets full of shops and Bag Pavilions, Ning Yao and the others went their own way to browse; Chen Ping’an walked beside Xu Xingjiu.

Smiling, Chen Ping’an said: “Xingjiu, you’re idle — come drink with me and Liu Jinglong?”

Xu Xingjiu’s expression turned awkward: “Better not.”

Liu’s string of nicknames had become notorious and he and Sword-Immortal Liu were seen as prime culprits. People joked “land-dragon that loves wine — unbeatable drinker Liu,” Pima’s Zhu Quan said “Liu can drink but may not know what wine truly is,” older master Wang Fusu joked “table-flight ascender Liu sect head,” and Floating Reed Sword Lake’s Lǐ Cai said “his drinking is not as good as people claim — at best two or three Lǐ Cai could match him.” Basically, any mountain connected to Taihui Sword Sect that loved drinking wouldn’t let Liu Jinglong off — even if you didn’t drink, they’d tease him.

Xu Xingjiu thought, if she were Liu Jinglong, her temper would surely fly and she’d curse people out; anyone who showed up to drink would be lambasted.

Chen Ping’an quietly asked: “Is she alright now?” (referring to someone from earlier ceremony)

At the last ceremony Xu Xingjiu had gone with Huan Yun to Luopo Mountain, but partner Zhao Qingwan did not appear, which worried Chen Ping’an.

Xu Xingjiu nodded and smiled, then adjusted her robes and bowed to Chen Ping’an in thanks. Much remained unspoken.

Mountain year-ends and mountain-heart matters are hard, and love matters hardest. Once passed, things get better.

Chen Ping’an breathed easier and patted Xu Xingjiu’s arm: “Don’t be so formal. No need.”

She straightened and asked softly: “Chen Mister — Spring Dew Garden?”

Chen Ping’an said: “It’s resolved. The one who tied the bell must untie it — if the heart problem isn’t Luopo Mountain’s, then Spring Dew Garden must solve it themselves.”

For many recent troubles, Chen Ping’an truly only saw them as nuisances, not problems. His trip to Spring Dew Garden involved seeing only Lin Cuo’e. The lesson was simple: no need to waste words with Spring Dew Garden’s cultivators. If they wanted continued business with Luopo Mountain, be honest and correct your errors. Even the Yuying Cliff and Ant Shop were not visited — a clear line drawn between private and public dealings. If they wished to change, Spring Dew Garden could decide how. If they chose to sever trade with Luopo Mountain, Luopo Mountain wouldn’t care. Soon Spring Dew Garden would find a truth: not only Pima Sect and Caique Mansion and Yunshang City, but also Taihui Sword Sect, Dayuan Chongxuan Office, Floating Reed Sword Lake, Water Dragon Sect, the two Canal Dukes — all would be Luopo Mountain’s allies in Beiku Luzhou. Luopo Mountain didn’t need to target Spring Dew Garden — their own guilt would show.

Chen Ping’an and Luopo Mountain had already opened a cross-continent trade path touching Dayuan Song, Piyun Mountain, Dong Shuijing, Guan Yiran, the old Long City Fan and Sun families… Spring Dew Garden couldn’t keep squeezing for all benefit when the world no longer tolerates taking advantage of the reasonable.

With Wenmiao’s reports lifting, soon mountains across Haoran would know who he was. Not just the young Luopo Mountain sect head — but tying the title “Hidden Lord” to Chen Ping’an might still take time.

So Chen Ping’an must finish his Beiku Luzhou journey quickly and return to Baoping Continent to spar-sword at Zhengyang Mountain with Liu Xianyang.

Chen Ping’an told Xu Xingjiu: “I won’t stay here. I must hurry.”

Xu Xingjiu clasped her fists and said: “Wishing Chen Mister a safe journey.”

Chen Ping’an returned the salute: “May your cultivation go smoothly and be blissful.”

———

At the Hundred-Flower Blessed Land’s new round of Flower-Goddess evaluations, the Impatiens Flower Goddess maintained her previous rank rather than falling; though she didn’t rise, the young goddess rejoiced so much she secretly hung a portrait of the blue-robed swordsman on her boudoir wall to burn incense to on new and full moons, thanking him for “saving her life.”

She longed for the next time Mr. Chen would visit the blessed land.

A younger girl, the Plantain Flower Goddess, held a small palm-sized plantain fan and asked her sister Rui Feng’er whether they had seen that A-Liang (Chen). The girl who recited flower poems least was the Plantain Goddess; her divine station was low and she had few sobriquets.

The Impatiens goddess said she hadn’t seen him but heard he was very heroic — he had grabbed a flying-ascension great cultivator with the Dao-name Qingmi and in a blink gone to Sword Qi City. The plantain-fan girl’s eyes sparkled upon hearing this.

Old Yupuo sword-immortal Yu Yue, as chief guest official for the Mi clan, had to escort that noble young master back to Aiai Continent; at his clan’s ferry, Yu Yue boarded a cross-continent ferry alone towards Baoping Continent’s northernmost crossing.

If the young Hidden Lord of Luopo Mountain were to pick disciples, success would depend on personal affinity. If not this time, run again.

Who in the world could rival that Hidden Lord at choosing sword-embryos?

After boarding, a knock came — the young Mi heir who had crept aboard; he said he planned to travel to Piyun Mountain in the north — he’d heard of the Night-Wandering Banquet there, always very entertaining.

In Shao Yuan Dynasty there was a wandering realm martial man who once carelessly broke an arm — Tong Jing.

Now back in the hometown jianghu, Tong Jing told everyone at taverns that he had been the one to ask the young Hidden Lord about fists!
