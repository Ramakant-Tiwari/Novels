There’s a loophole in the first reason. Couldn’t they transfer Nikolaus’s suspicions onto me after revealing my identity?
There are no suspicions to transfer in the first place, and even if there were, there’s no need to worry.
As mentioned before, articles about students are heavily censored, especially photos and videos.
This applies to all students supported by the royal family, meaning I’ll be protected from such unproductive gossip even when I attend the Imperial First Academy.
In short, there’s no persistence in the controversy.
Fires need fuel to burn.
I opened the part where the 77-year-old claim was written.
“Why 77?”
“They probably guessed.”
Elias answered nonchalantly.
“Well, maybe, but what if it’s a result of misreading 17?”
“Must be terrible handwriting. But yeah… some people do write like that.”
“Yeah… Anyway, yellow journalism doesn’t rely solely on imagination. They need some basis to convince readers. There’s always some exaggeration and fabrication, but they do some investigation.”
“So.”
At Leo’s words, I nodded toward the magazine he put down.
“Did you only check Dasrothe?”
“Yes.”
I pulled out another magazine from my bag.
“Other places have similar content. Not as detailed as Dasrothe, though.”
Elias laughed as he opened the magazine I handed him.
“Why does this one say you’re in your 20s?”
This is why it’s advantageous for me.
As I thought before, I can use this to create confusion.
Ch 43: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family
Chapter 43
“Hmm, I see~ It also says here that you’re estimated to be in your late twenties to early thirties. Now I understand why you’re so calm, Lucas.”
Narce softly smiled as he flipped through another booklet. Leo, who had been pressing his forehead with dead eyes, lifted his eyelids and quietly asked me.
“I remember you telling me before that there’s no need to stop the yellow press… but after seeing today’s article, you’re not still thinking of using them, are you?”
“I am.”
“Sigh…”
Leo pressed his eyes with both hands.
It’s amazing how someone who acts like they’ll die if they don’t follow the rules can be close friends with Elias.
Well, he does have some similarities with Elias.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to push his way into obtaining a fake citizen identity in Wittelsbach.
At that moment, Narce, who had been staring at me, spoke up.
“Lucas.”
“Yes?”
“It might be tiring… but I think you can handle it. Hang in there.”
Did he use his foresight ability?
It probably means that the overall flow isn’t bad.
“Thanks.”
“Hey, the article here says you have social anxiety and don’t meet people. If they’re going to report on the same person, shouldn’t they at least get their stories straight?”
Elias chuckled again.
I smiled back at him.
“If they go with that angle, it’s good for me.”
“You seem relaxed. Are you enjoying the feeling of the entire nation being made fools of, except for us?”
“Well, I can’t say there isn’t some of that. In terms of figuring out the truth and the public’s trust, they’ve already lost.”
To deduce anything, the information has to be consistent.
This fight is one they’re destined to lose since Nicolaus isn’t a real person but was created only in the second half of this year.
“Trust~ That’s a good one. It’s already over.”
“Yeah. Those who get interested will look for more tabloids that mention my story.”
“If it were me, I’d scrape up every last copy from the newsstand. Honestly, after dealing with the barrier suitability issue, I was going to look into where this Nicolaus came from.”
“……”
Suddenly, I felt a chill.
I nodded as calmly as possible.
“…Right. I see. But if every report tells a different story, what can you do?”
“It’s annoying. So, what’s the truth? Ah, forget it. It’s my fault for trying to find out here… right?”
Elias shrugged.
Yeah.
Even without the attitude of “I’ll find out no matter what,” it’s the same.
If every report tells a different story, it’s a chance to realize that what you’re reading isn’t reliable information but just gossip.
Of course, even if they do get their stories straight, it’s still beneficial.
When only incorrect information is circulating, what harm is there in aligning the stories?
Either way, it’s just amusing and helpful.
At that moment, Leo frowned at the increased false information.
“Wait. Speaking of which… how did the social anxiety story come up?”
“They got an interview with someone who claimed to be Nicolaus’s friend from childhood. Lucas, did you read it?”
“Yes.”
It was an interview with someone from the Papal State.
He claimed that he had a friend named Nicolaus when he was young.
Nicolaus had often done inexplicable magical things since childhood, then one day disappeared and hasn’t been seen since.
There are cases where a mage is born from non-mages, without inheriting magic through genetics.
He probably thought Nicolaus was one of those cases.
Of course, he isn’t me, but it’s an incredibly detailed and convenient scenario.
Leo, looking incredulous, asked with a downward turn of his lips.
“What, someone who was friends with Nicolaus?”
“Yes.”
“…There are plenty of people named Nicolaus in the world, so what….”
Leo muttered skeptically.
I agree.
But from the perspective of the yellow press, such fact-checking isn’t important.
If it’s specific enough and interesting, people will easily believe it. The public not scrutinizing the truth of the articles also plays a part.
‘Should I confirm again at this point?’
First, the suggestion.
Chapter 4. Constant Dripping Wears Away a Stone (2)
Suggestion 3: [Impression] Score 5 Defense (?/N) (152 hours 17 minutes 53 seconds)
* Route 1 — Chapter 5. Good Things Take Time (1)
* Route 2 — Chapter 5. Do Not Praise the Day Before Evening Comes
Defend the score of 5.
It means to prevent it from falling into the 4-point range.
In a way, it’s a precarious statement.
Rounding to the third decimal place, it’s exactly 5 points.
Even rounding to the fourth decimal place, it’s 5.002 points.
But there is hope.
When the saying “it’s getting harder to raise the score” means, for example, this:
To go from stage 1 to stage 2, you only needed 10,000,000, but to go from stage 2 to stage 3, you need 100,000. Even if the value goes down, it doesn’t easily fall to the stage.
Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 (+0.1) [+5.0015129]
‘The last digit dropped from 15131 to 15129.’
But this can be seen as oscillating in place.
With a national media outlet like Dasrothe attacking me, just as the live broadcast raised it by 3 points, it could also drop by 1 point increments.
While it’s true that their reports benefit me, I’m not letting my guard down, so let’s thoroughly calculate again.
“What time did today’s Dasrothe come out?”
“Six in the morning.”
Leo answered in a low voice.
The publication times for the newspaper are 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Sales increase around these times.
Now, at 11:50 p.m., today’s impression score changes have already been experienced.
There must have been constant rises and falls….
Due to the live broadcast and the Bavarian press conference, the upward trend has been maintained so far.
‘The real challenge starts tomorrow.’
Dasrothe is a daily newspaper.
From the point when they seriously report that I’ve been walking on seven legs, my impression score will start to decline little by little.
Considering the number of people who take yellow press seriously, it’s possible to drive someone to death.
Depending on the credibility of the content, it might not just decrease slightly but sharply.
“Leo, when are you going to make the threat?”
“I’m planning to convene a meeting tomorrow evening.”
Leo replied, massaging his temples and closing his eyes, seemingly stressed by all the headaches.
“Alright. Thanks in advance.”
“I’d do it earlier if I could… If it becomes unbearable, let me know. I’ll go back to Bavaria tomorrow morning and inform Mother.”
“Oh ho, so you can skip school like that~”
Elias laughed from the side.
“…! Do you think I’m skipping to have fun like you?!”
“Huh…? This time, I was just jealous?! What kind of behavior have I shown that you immediately take it this way~?”
Well… it can’t be helped.
I thought the same as Leo.
“And I wasn’t playing around! I was out exploring.”
“Exploring for three whole months?!”
I shook my head, cutting off Elias and Leo’s argument.
“It’s fine. That amount of time is enough.”
By tomorrow evening… the insane rumors about me being involved with seven different people will have spread.
The most important thing is whether this turns into a long-term issue or not.
By the day after tomorrow, the stories about me will start to die down. Even if they don't disappear entirely, at least the excessively sensational stories will be gone.
At this point, it's necessary to review each of their decisions.
Wasn't the timing of releasing my story a bit off?
Why did they release it when my approval rating was rising?
‘Idiots.’
The best time to release a scandal would be when I’m seen as a saint by everyone, to maximize the impact.
Why didn’t they patiently wait until I reached my peak?
I leaned back in my chair, tapping the pen on the paper.
Watching the ink seep in cleared my thoughts.
It’s obvious.
Their goal is to boost their immediate sales with sensational headlines and photos.
If their goal was to socially bury Nicolaus, they wouldn’t have released something as trivial as ‘37 Reasons He Wears a Mask’.
With the explosive interest due to the live broadcast, now is the perfect time to increase sales.
‘They’ll probably scratch the surface now to milk it for what it’s worth, and if my approval rating rises again later… they’ll drop another major scandal to boost sales twice.’
Sorry, but by then, I’ll be a student again, and they won’t be able to report such things anymore.
Anyway, their motive is clear.
Since there’s no lobby pushing to drive Nicolaus to the edge, this fight is manageable.
I just need to enjoy the mudslinging and prevent my impression score from dropping into the 4-point range.

“Lucas, what are you reading?!”
At 3 PM, Pie climbed onto my shoulder and looked down at the booklet I was holding.
“Trash.”
“How do you read trash? Isn’t that a magazine?”
“No. From now on, it’s trash.”
I threw the booklet into the incinerator behind the school and headed straight to the dormitory.
‘Status window.’
Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0008931]
From 15129 to 8931.
The 10,000 range has collapsed.
The reason is obvious.
There are people who believe Dasrothe’s ridiculous report.
Do they really think I have time to meet seven people?
Or do they just find it entertaining and believe it for fun?
‘Losing 6000 is still manageable.’
The report was more meticulous than I thought.
Yesterday’s Dasrothe cover was typical yellow journalism, but today’s issue had my photo on the cover.
It was a close-up of me taken through a window at a charity event, cropped to show my eyes clearly.
The editing, angle, and mask's curvature made me look like a villain. It’s impressive how they managed to pick such a photo for the cover.
Alongside it were three or four fake interviews.
It’s a method they frequently use, regardless of the controversy.
And the most shocking part was the fabricated photos.
They dressed someone with a similar build to me as Nicolaus and staged plausible situations.
‘They put a lot of effort into this.’
Judging by the score change, the results weren’t as good as the effort put in.
If they had gotten the reaction they wanted, my impression score would have dropped to the 4-point range, if not the 3-point range.
Of course, it’s not negligible. If I leave it as it is, it will drop to the 4-point range before midnight.
Still…
‘About three hours left.’
In three hours, the decline will end.
Let’s see how much it drops by then.
I changed clothes and warped to the Bavarian border, obtained permission, and moved to the investigation bureau’s building.
Since I met the chamberlain and took my medicine today, I had a legitimate reason to skip school.
It was around 3:30 PM.
I found the office I was looking for, and an investigator recognized me and greeted me.
“You’re here.”
“Yes, can you tell me how far the investigation has progressed?”
“We’ve just finished everything.”
He pulled out the papers from the typewriter and bundled them together.
“There were no Bavarians. All were Prussians, commoners, and those with poor economic conditions. None of the four people mobilized had much contact with the outside world. And, of course, there were no mages.”
“I see.”
“Here, take a look and let us know if more investigation is needed.”
“Alright.”
I took the file he handed me.
[Analysis Results of Dasrothe Issues 11-14]
Yesterday, I contacted Bavaria and requested an investigation on today’s Dasrothe publication.
To devote an entire issue to the story about me walking on seven legs, they needed clear evidence to capture people’s interest.
But since there’s no such evidence, they had to create it themselves.
And indeed, fake interviews and photos were published.
Turning the page, I saw the photo from Dasrothe.
Greta Velter.
The person claiming to be my lover.
Well, technically, she didn’t make the claim.
The interviews were all written by Dasrothe, and this person probably just provided the photo.
Next to it were details about her residence, occupation, workplace, and family relationships.
From what I know, the novel's setting was a time when investigations couldn’t be conducted so quickly… It feels like this world, intertwined with magic, has developed at least half a century faster in this regard.
‘Fast and convenient. In the real world, in the past, it would’ve been impossible to find this.’
I closed the file and placed it in the envelope he handed me.
“This is sufficient. Thank you.”
“No problem. Where will you go next?”
I recalled the residence of the person on the first page and replied.
“I’ll start with Schlau.”
“Then I’ll inform the Crown Prince that you moved to Schlau Province at 3:50 PM.”
“Okay.”
I greeted him briefly and left, heading back to school.
I needed to bring Narce.
*
“Is Greta Velter here?”
I arrived with Narce to find the person I supposedly had a long-term relationship with, unbeknownst to me.
Narce, wearing a suspicious white mask, seemed to be enjoying the situation, continuously smirking.
I couldn’t see his expression due to the mask, but his breathing, mixed with laughter, gave it away.
‘This guy… doesn’t seem entirely normal.’
Well, high school students about to take entrance exams are all like this, I suppose.
At least, that was my generalization based on my high school years.
Anyway, the reason I brought Narce was that I needed his insight ability today.
I’m going to make the person in the photo tell the truth and then take them to the investigation agency to testify.
For that, I need someone to verify the facts.
Although it feels a bit like exploiting him… Narce had mentioned wanting to visit restricted areas while concealing his identity, so I brought him without much guilt.
Since Leo went to Bavaria today, it was easier to take Narce, who hadn’t decided on a purification contract yet, on a business-related trip.
He’s actually here, but it’s for the sake of appearances.
At that moment, the wooden door rattled.
Creak—
“Who is it…?”
Someone opened the door and widened their eyes upon seeing us.
The person from the Dasrothe photo, looking both bewildered and excited, raised their voice.
“Oh, Sir Nicolaus? Is it really you?!”
Ch 44: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family
Chapter 44
It’s an unexpected reaction.
The person standing in front of me is definitely the same person from the first interview photo in Dasrothe.
But shouldn’t he be more apprehensive about meeting me?
He looked me up and down as if examining a rare creature, then tilted his head in curiosity.
“But… what brings you here? There are no restricted areas or busy streets nearby. You’ve come quite far.”
“…I came to speak with you privately. Can we talk?”
“It’s nothing strange, right? Could it be that the demonic beasts have reached here…?”
Does he really think nothing is strange? Seriously?
It’s absurd, but starting off emotionally wouldn’t be a good choice.
“Well, I think you would know better about that, Mr. Velter.”
“Me?! Did I do something wrong?”
“……”
I felt a headache coming on and forced a smile.
Narce sighed briefly and tapped my arm.
“Sir.”
“Yes…?”
Narce smiled and snapped his fingers.
—“Come to think of it, I’m not sure what to call you. Shall I just call you Sir Nicolaus?”
“…!”
It wasn’t the content of his words that surprised me.
It was the way they were delivered.
Just like how Pai’s words seem to bypass the air and directly lodge into my mind, Narce’s words were delivered in the same way.
‘Did he do this with Divine Power too?’
It seems like a useful skill to learn.
I nodded.
Narce smiled and spoke again.
—“Haha, it feels a bit strange. I’ll call you that for now. And… that person really doesn’t know. He’s not even thinking about Dasrothe.”
Not even thinking about Dasrothe?
Even after seeing me?
‘…Wait.’
It’s entirely possible.
This could be an opportunity to really screw over Dasrothe.
Having assessed the situation, I spoke to him softly.
“No, there’s something I need to investigate. I came because I need Mr. Velter’s help.”
“Help? Is there something I can help you with?”
“Of course. I urgently need some information. If you have time, I’d like to talk with you.”
He looked back and forth between me and Narce, confused, before opening the door wide.
“I’m not sure what this is about… but please, come in.”
We sat at the table he indicated.
“I don’t have much to offer right now. I’ll go out and get something.”
“No, our schedule is a bit tight. It’s fine.”
It was already close to 4:30 PM.
We still had other places to visit, so we couldn’t linger here for long.
“Really? I feel bad since you came all this way…”
“It’s really fine. We’re here to ask for your help.”
“Oh, right. What do you need to ask about?”
“Have you heard any stories about me?”
Narce snickered beside me.
The way I phrased it made me sound incredibly self-centered.
I restrained my urge to explain and waited seriously for his answer.
“You’re Sir Nicolaus, right? I saw it in the Empire’s newspaper a few days ago.”
“You saw it. Do you have any other information?”
“No… just that you did something completely unexpected with Duke Elias… Is there something else?”
He frowned deeply, stroking his chin as if trying to recall something.
No matter how hard he thought, it seemed like nothing came to mind.
I pulled out a copy of yesterday’s Dasrothe from my bag and handed it to him.
“Oh.”
He frowned at the cover and nodded.
“Impressive. Yesterday’s issue features you, Sir Nicolaus.”
“The content isn’t impressive at all.”
He flipped through a few pages and then smiled awkwardly.
“Haha… indeed. Did you read this yourself?”
“Yes.”
“Really? Are you okay?”
He squinted and cautiously continued.
“Surely you’re not this calm because it’s all true…? You’re not actually meeting seven people at 77….”
“No, that’s not the case.”
I pulled out today’s magazine and pushed it towards him.
“Read this too.”
He nodded and turned the first page.
The smile vanished from his face.
“What?”
He flipped the pages back and forth, then hurriedly scanned through from the beginning.
‘As I thought….’
I chuckled inwardly.
They didn’t get permission to use the photo.
They just used anyone’s face.
It’s astonishing how recklessly Dasrothe operates.
‘Well… it’s the same everywhere.’
The royal family also operates sloppily, so what can you expect?
He, now pale as a ghost, pointed to his photo in the magazine.
“What’s this? That’s not me?”
“Asking me won’t change anything….”
“R-right. It looks like me… No, it is me. But why is this here?!”
Narce stared at him and asked.
“Mr. Velter, do you know anything about this?”
“No. I never had any such interview… No one ever asked me for one! And I’ve never met Sir Nicolaus until today, so why would I say such things? What the heck are these people talking about?”
“Hmm, okay. It’s the truth.”
Narce spoke to Mr. Velter as if to reassure him.
But he was actually conveying it to me.
“Of course. I’m so shocked I can’t even speak properly. How could they use my face like this?!”
Not “Why is my face here?” but “How could they use my face like this?”
In any case, this man isn’t entirely uninvolved.
Narce also sensed this and quickly asked about the incident’s details.
“What exactly happened?”
“Some people came by before and offered five thousand pel for five photos, saying they wanted to take some pictures for a newspaper…. I guess that’s when they took these.”
“Five thousand pel.”
Narce pressed the end of his sentence.
They bought each photo for 100,000 won.
If it were me, I wouldn’t sell my face for 500,000 won, but different people have different perspectives.
“They just asked me to look serious while looking at the sea, saying it was for a regional promotion. They introduced themselves that way too…. I had no idea it would be used like this….”
Mr. Velter looked furious as he held his head.
I leaned forward and asked.
“So they didn’t tell you exactly how it would be used?”
“They just said it was for capturing the article’s concept. If I had known, I wouldn’t have agreed.”
“I see.”
I smiled and checked the time.
The rest will finish sooner than expected.
*
Mr. Velter, who was determined to sue Dasrothe immediately, exchanged contact information with us.
After thinking it over calmly for a moment, Mr. Velter seemed to recall the cost of filing a lawsuit and became less enthusiastic, but I could cover that expense. All I needed from him was his willingness to participate in the legal battle.
And, it turned out the other two people were in the same situation as him.
Both were equally shocked to see how their photos were used and, although they were clearly weary of getting involved in a lawsuit that could drag on for years, they were willing to testify to the relevant authorities after some persuasion.
And now… it's 6 PM.
“It’s 6 PM!”
The moment I lowered my arm after checking the time, Pai popped its head out of Narce’s robe pocket.
Having been asleep the entire time, it must have remembered what I murmured while it was in the room with me yesterday.
Since I planned to make 6 PM the inflection point for the impression score, it was important to check the numbers from this time.
“Wow~ On the dot!”
Narce checked his wristwatch and was impressed.
‘But how did it know the time….’
Even Narce, the owner, seemed to be discovering this ability for the first time.
It would be nice to carry Pai around when there’s no clock.
Anyway, that’s not the important thing right now.
I opened the status window.
Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0003821]
Earlier, it dropped from 10,000 to 8931.
During the time I was finishing the investigation, it dropped another 5000.
Considering that the evening newspaper hasn’t been published yet, this is quite a significant change for the 3-6 PM period.
At this rate, from now on, as we enter the actual evening hours, the drop will be even steeper, and it could fall into the 4-point range in just a couple of hours.
No, it’s not “it could fall” but “it’s already falling rapidly.”
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0003789]
Yeah. No surprise there.
Just a blink of an eye and it dropped another 32 points.
We stopped by the Bavarian Investigation Bureau and then returned to school.
After changing clothes at the dormitory, we warped to the meeting location for a conference.
Narce had already arrived before me and was waiting with the other students.
As I exchanged brief greetings with the students and took my seat, they resumed their conversation.
“I don’t know if it’s true, but honestly, I hope it’s not. Who are they trying to please with this?”
“It’s for Pleroma. God, can’t they read the room? Even if it happened, they should have revealed it later….”
“Maybe Pleroma’s behind it?”
Everyone was talking about Nicolaus.
But all the students here seemed to be extremely hostile towards Pleroma, so they were blindly siding with Nicolaus regardless of the rumors.
After all, Nicolaus was the initial whistleblower in this case and had significantly impacted Pleroma along with Elias.
I took the prepared materials and stood in front of the blackboard to speak.
“Alright, it’s already 7:30. Let’s start today’s analysis.”
I took out the newspaper sheets from each press, which were stored here, and cast a spell.
The text forming today’s articles slowly revealed itself.
- [Hessen] Nicolaus Ernst Joins Grand Duchy of Hesse and Two Other Nations' Purification Efforts: “Will Help As Many Citizens As Possible”
- Leopold of Württemberg Thanks Nicolaus Ernst for Responding to Request
- Three Days Left in Grace Period: Württemberg, Hesse, and Baden Successfully Recruit Mages Amidst Manpower Shortage
“Wow.”
The students, who were reading the evening papers with me, let out brief exclamations.
“This guy’s really planning to go to multiple places.”
“Bavaria alone has five restricted areas, and now he’s adding three more countries?”
“So, he’s going to travel four times a week…? Does he have the strength for that?”
“Yeah, let’s wrap up Dasrothe like this!”
I chuckled at the last comment.
They think just like me.
One reason the decline has slowed is this very thing.
Yesterday, I moved to Bavaria to initiate an investigation into the false report in today’s Dasrothe.
Since Dasrothe must have bribed people to create evidence, breaking that would resolve many issues.
‘This alone is enough to defend.’
But dealing with crazy people like Dasrothe, who operate outside the bounds of common sense, requires more than a “moderate” approach.
They could bribe our witnesses or give absurd explanations like “it was just a reference image” and exploit the public’s tendency to be drawn to sensationalism, regardless of the truth.
Given that they’ve claimed without any evidence that I’ve been involved with seven people, it’s a route they could consider.
Therefore, the solution is to knock them down so hard that they can’t even think about getting back up.
To do that, I have to give them a reason to attack me again.
And these articles are exactly that bait.
“Wow, all seven newspapers have this story on the front page.”
“At least they’re not behaving like Dasrothe.”
Multiple newspapers reported on the resolution of the purification issue in three countries on their front pages.
From regional to national newspapers, they all leaned towards factual reporting.
If they only cared about increasing sales, they would have coPaid Dasrothe’s report and changed a few words, but they didn’t. Besides, it’s not a political issue.
These factual newspapers have consistently criticized the behavior of tabloids like Dasrothe.
Unless there’s a specific vested interest, there’s no reason for them to cover the controversy generated by those tabloids.
It’s now 7:40 PM.
It’s been more than an hour since the last check.
By this time, people would start accessing the evening news.
‘Let’s check it out.’
Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0002829]
An hour ago, it was 3789.
It dropped by 960.
‘Ha.’
960.
It dropped by 5000 earlier.
If we evenly divide the drop from 3-6 PM, it fell by about 1670 per hour.
But between 6 PM and 7:40 PM, it dropped by less than 1000.
Even though we’ve entered the time zone where newspaper purchases increase, the impression score dropped less than during 3-6 PM.
If the decline during the second most impactful time zone of the day is this mild….
‘It’s over.’
I smiled and closed the status window.
This indicates that this morning’s Dasrothe already drew enough public interest.
It also means not many people were encountering the evening edition of Dasrothe for the first time.
‘The impression score didn’t drop as much as expected.’
Considering the overall trend, it suggests that people looked at the report but didn’t fully believe it.
Due to the live broadcast, a favorable impression of me has taken root more strongly than the gossip.
Dasrothe’s timing failed.
On top of that, their growth rate has plummeted….
‘They should be getting desperate by now.’
Now, they just need to attack me with a new topic.
It’s been almost two hours since the purification reports were released.
Dasrothe has had enough time to revise their articles.
Even if it’s not as impactful as the morning, they wouldn’t want to miss out on evening sales, so if they’re a bit more greedy, they’ll try to attack me in this edition as well.
Maybe they’ll come out with a new report tomorrow morning.
I looked down at the newspaper and quietly asked.
“Who has the current Dasrothe?”
“Dasrothe? I do!”
A student pulled the magazine from his bag, froze, unable to take his eyes off the title, and then showed the cover to the students.
“Look at this… They’re at it again.”
The students fell silent at the bright red text covering the lower part of today’s Dasrothe cover.
The title had been changed.
“1,775,000 Pel of Taxpayer Money, Misused for an Affair? Sir Nicolaus’ ‘Sacred’ Purification”
Ch 45: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family
Chapter 45
17.75 million pel.
They've already calculated my pay.
The weekly purification fee from the four countries, including Bavaria, is 3.55 million pel, which is 355 million won.
It looks like they multiplied it by five weeks.
‘Why multiply it by five weeks when it's a weekly payment?’
It's obvious what kind of picture they're trying to paint.
“…Wow.”
Narce chuckled and shook his head.
A student, unaware of the situation, looked around at the other students and asked.
“What is it? Is he saying he’s going to spend all that money on cheating?”
“Seems like it? It’s amazing how they come up with these headlines….”
Even without looking at the content, it’s obvious.
It’s just a bunch of ridiculous fabrications.
Anyway….
I glanced at the magazine cover the student was holding and threw out a comment.
“You must need a lot of money yourself.”
“Exactly. How much more do they want to squeeze out? It’s just absurd now.”
Another student absentmindedly responded to my remark.
I checked the time and smiled.
“Well, that’s it for today.”
“What about Dasrothe? You said you needed it. I can lend it to you.”
“No, it's fine now. Let’s wrap things up here and call it a day.”
*
Capital, Dasrothe Headquarters.
“You’re saying we should cancel the title and postpone it to tomorrow morning?”
The deputy director looked at the person in front of him, dumbfounded.
“Yes.”
“Why? If we miss the buzz now, we’ll be out of the spotlight in an instant. You know that….”
“Since the report on the additional purification in the three countries, we haven’t properly investigated Sir Nicolaus on our end, Deputy Director.”
The deputy director put down his pen, took off his glasses, and burst into laughter.
“Since when have we been so dedicated to investigation? Just go ahead and publish it. We need to meet this week’s target.”
“I don’t see an issue with that part, but… I’ve heard that the Bavarian royal family has scheduled an interview regarding Sir Nicolaus’s purification case.”
“An interview?”
“Yes. They’ve already contacted the political department of the Bavarian Kingdom’s newspaper as of last night.”
The deputy director stroked his chin with his hand at that statement.
“It’s been scheduled since last night… Last night was when we ran the headline on Nicolaus, right? They must be planning to provide an explanation. Just push through.”
“Yes. But I came to inform you because there seems to be a risk. If they haven’t canceled the changed title yet, they must be confident about something. I’ve heard that the Bavarian royal family has already convened two emergency meetings today, so it might be related….”
The deputy director laughed incredulously and gestured with his head.
“Did you really come all the way here to tell me that? This isn’t the first time we’re dealing with something like this. Why are you suddenly acting this way? This article was chosen by the Director himself, so just go ahead.”
“……”
Seeing his opponent not responding clearly and choosing his words carefully, the deputy director’s face hardened.
“We need to seize the moment. You think we should back off just because the royal family had a couple of meetings and scheduled an interview? How are you planning to work here with that mindset? This isn’t the Imperial Times.”
“Pardon? No…”
“Instead of sitting here lamenting, you should be out there asking more questions. Is this the time to talk about changing the front page? I hope you’ve sent out the reporters properly. Do I have to explain everything step by step?”
“No, I’m sorry. I’ll head back and…”
Seeing the deputy director’s displeased face, he quickly nodded and tried to wrap up the conversation.
The deputy director softened his tone slightly and continued.
“Wait a moment.”
“Yes?”
“I’m not trying to scold you, just pointing out the reality. You know why he’s confident, right? When he sits for that interview, there will inevitably be questions. Why do you think he hasn’t canceled?”
“I… I don’t know.”
“‘I’m absolutely not going to spend the money that way; I’ll definitely donate it to society.’ That’s what he’s going to say. He thinks a belated explanation will improve his image.”
“……”
“Everyone does that! But that’s actually a self-destructive move. It only makes people wonder why he’s explaining it in an interview. That drives sales up. Isn’t that right? And if our assumption is wrong? What if it’s something else? Then we just leave out the money part and focus on the affair again.”
“Yes, I understand. I’ll do that.”
Realizing that his argument wasn’t getting through, he quickly nodded.
The deputy director smiled gently again and encouraged him.
“Just do your best in the moment. No need to worry too much about the long-term. What do you think our readers are thinking when they read this?”
“……”
“They’re not thinking much. As long as we give them a daily issue to latch onto, our job is done. So, set today’s target and focus on hitting those numbers. Right? And remember, all front-page articles are approved by the Director, so don’t think about changing it.”
“Yes, understood.”
“Good. Now, go on.”
The deputy director watched him leave and fell into thought.
Then, he asked his secretary to bring today’s edition of the Bavarian Kingdom’s newspaper.

Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0002513]
Two hours ago, it was 2829, so it’s only decreased by 300 in two hours.
Considering that it dropped by 30 when I blinked during the day, it’s a rather gentle decline.
Again, I find myself at the interview hall in Bavaria.
I looked at the now-familiar interview hall and the broadcasting cameras, preparing to make my announcement.
Honestly, I wondered if it would be better to have a representative speak in my place.
Given my current state, it might actually be a negative in terms of conveying a personal touch.
However, considering the sensitivity of the issue, I decided it would be better if I personally addressed this matter.
The signal to start the broadcast came in, and unlike last time, I placed both hands on the interview table and greeted everyone briefly.
Not wanting to drag it out unnecessarily, I got straight to the point.
“As reported by the Imperial Times and various newspapers at 6 PM today, I have accepted the purification requests from the Kingdom of Württemberg, Hessen, and the Grand Duchy of Baden.”
As soon as I finished speaking, questions started pouring in.
“I have a question! Previously, Hessen offered double the payment. Did you actually sign the contract under those terms?”
“There were many requests. Why did you choose these three countries, including Württemberg?”
I gave brief answers and waited for the next question.
Fortunately, the controversy raised by Dasrothe didn’t come up immediately.
After answering three or four questions, the topic finally surfaced.
“I have a question. At 8 PM, Dasrothe used the term ‘purification for adultery funds’ regarding Sir Nicolaus Ernst’s decision. What is your response to this?”
The question came from a journalist known for criticizing Dasrothe.
This question was aimed more at criticizing Dasrothe than supporting them.
There were also journalists from Dasrothe’s Bavarian branch present, but they hadn’t spoken up yet.
I don’t know why they’re being so patient… but now is my chance.
“I disagree. It’s bewildering to hear such claims presented as facts without any evidence. Contrary to what Dasrothe alleges, I have never been involved in any improper relationships. I intend to resolve this matter legally.”
Since such statements could never fully prove my innocence, it was better to touch on it briefly and move on.
Finally, I saw Dasrothe’s journalists raising their hands. I gestured toward them and began to speak.
“Since the topic has come up, let me clarify the facts regarding Dasrothe’s latest claim.”
Some journalists started muttering spells and grabbed their cameras.
Although the broadcast was managed by the Bavarian Kingdom’s newspaper, it seemed they intended to record this scene directly.
“This morning, I donated all of the three-month service fees received from the four countries, including Bavaria. I hadn’t planned to disclose this, but I don’t want my intentions to be misunderstood due to these offensive claims.”
The journalists’ expressions changed instantly.
Loud questions erupted from all around.
“This morning? That’s different from what Dasrothe claimed. What are your thoughts on this?”
“Where did you donate it to…?”
“At exactly what time, and to which institution?”
As I didn’t respond, one of the aides Leo had assigned to me intervened and restrained the journalists.
“We will allow time for questions later. Please wait until the statement is completely finished.”
“I received 1,020,000 pel from Bavaria for 12 weeks of service, and 1,200,000, 1,440,000, and 600,000 pel from Württemberg, Hessen, and Baden respectively. The full amounts were donated to the contamination relief centers and Pleroma processing units of each country. For detailed information, please refer to the documents attached to the Bavarian Kingdom’s newspaper.”
The sound of pens scratching quickly on paper continued.
Dasrothe only changed their title at 8 PM after seeing my purification report at 6 PM.
Too late.
I had already donated all my fees twelve hours ago.
And by now, I should be receiving a call.
*
“So that’s what it was….”
The deputy director of Dasrothe, watching the broadcast, threw down the Bavarian Kingdom’s newspaper and frowned.
Posthumous explanations are meaningless.
Announcing ‘what will be done’ only after a controversy has arisen inherently lacks credibility.
It might be different if the person was known for a good reputation, but for someone like Nicolaus, who hasn’t been in the public eye long, there’s no data to support such claims.
‘That’s what I thought….’
If he had acted contrary to our allegations from the beginning, then we had misstepped from the start.
We need to change the topic before we get further entangled.
Absolutely.
If Dasrothe continues in this futile situation, we won’t be able to use the Nicolaus story at all.
He tapped the table with his fingers and called for his secretary.
“It’s 10 o’clock now. Change the title and connect the magic again.”
“Deputy Director, we’ve already used up today’s magic recharges when we changed the content earlier.”
“Damn it….”
The deputy director furrowed his brows, crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair.
The reaction to today’s report wasn’t as big as expected. Maybe it’s better to post a new one tomorrow morning.
This topic can still be reused for a few more days.
Since it’s already late, it shouldn’t hurt to post it in the morning….
While the deputy director was lost in thought, the secretary spoke again.
“We need the Director’s approval to transfer tomorrow’s magic allocation. He’s at home, so I’ll go there now.”
“No, no, it’s fine.”
“Are you going to leave today’s report as it is?”
“Yes. Let’s post it early tomorrow. Since it’s already late, I don’t think the results will be significant, and we can keep using this topic for the next few days….”
Knock, knock—
“Come…”
“Deputy Director!”
Before he could respond to the knock, the door burst open.
“The Royal Investigation Bureau… No, the building… Bavaria…”
“Speak properly. What are you saying?”
At the deputy director’s words, he caught his breath and spoke.
“The Royal Investigation Bureau has sealed off our building. Both the main office and the Bavarian branch.”
Ch 46: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family
Chapter 46
I answered the journalists' questions and checked the time.
Assuming Dasrothe would exploit the purification announcement, I considered the directions they might take.
First and foremost, from Dasrothe’s perspective, they might think this:
‘Is he pretending to be virtuous to cover up the controversy?’
Of course, they would emphasize that my intentions are not virtuous.
The best way to provoke public sentiment is to cast me as an outsider, and presenting unrealistic magical rewards with specific figures is a tactic Dasrothe might use.
Dasrothe is accustomed to exploiting every topic related to desires, including money, so it was likely they would target the rewards.
“I have a question.”
“Yes.”
“The Royal Investigation Bureau expressed its intention to investigate Dasrothe, and the Imperial Court immediately issued a search warrant. This is based on the claim that Dasrothe used photos of Prussian citizens unrelated to the interview to fabricate reports.”
Although this question is not related to the purification topic, the aide wisely did not interrupt.
Here it comes.
Although the preemptive donation blocked one of their expected counterattacks, it couldn't end there.
Are they the type to back down just because they were slightly off in their prediction?
No. They could easily shift the focus from money to the affair.
‘When they reveal the fabricated reports, it’s over.’
I thought Bavaria’s warning would come first, but this came up instead.
No matter. Both will have significant impacts.
I smiled and listened to the journalist's continued question.
“I wonder if this issue had to go as far as a search and seizure, and I am curious about the Imperial Court’s response in issuing the warrant. Do you know if the Bavarian Kingdom and the Bavarian Federal Government were involved?”
It’s a valid question.
To summarize, his question is this:
‘The Royal family usually turns a blind eye to anything that doesn't harm them directly, so why are they conducting a search and seizure over just a few photos of commoners?’
Honestly, I wasn’t certain the prosecutors—meaning the Royal family—would request a search warrant.
I don't act with certainty unless I can read someone's mind.
However, it’s not unreasonable for the prosecution to consider a search warrant necessary.
Is it plausible that a news outlet, known for its fair and just evidence gathering, suddenly decided to fabricate reports on a grand scale this time?
‘Not likely.’
Especially considering that the subject is Dasrothe, who has likely always manipulated information.
Of course, Dasrothe wouldn’t want to hand over evidence of their history of fabrications, so they might destroy all records or move them to a safe place.
There’s enough reason for a search warrant now.
So, let’s think about this.
‘Why are they reacting so strongly to an issue that doesn’t directly concern the Royal family?’
Hasn’t Dasrothe cleverly generated gossip about the Royal family or government officials in their reports over the past few years?
Of course, they have. They touch on anything with a hint of sensationalism.
They haven’t gone to the extreme as they have with me, but they’ve always skirted regulations and avoided penalties by phrasing things as ‘suspicions are being raised.’
‘And those suspicions were all originally created by Dasrothe.’
While it might not have been a significant blow, the Royal family likely sees them as a subject to be closely monitored, a target that should be properly dealt with.
However, in a society where media and the Royal family often collude, they usually align their interests.
The Royal family has previously hinted at their targets to Dasrothe, guiding the situation to their favor.
So… cutting off their magic support would be a waste of a useful card, and simply warning them would be ineffective because Dasrothe knows the Royal family needs them as much as they need the Royal family.
Thus, the Royal family, seeing a good opportunity, gave a strong warning, showing their power without inflicting long-term damage.
The timing was right.
The Royal family wanted to give Dasrothe a meaningful warning, and I needed to prevent Dasrothe from reinforcing false rumors about an affair.
I finished my thoughts and answered the journalist’s question.
“As you know, I am a citizen of Bavaria. I reported Dasrothe’s fabricated interviews and photo materials to the Bavarian Investigation Bureau according to my nationality. I am not aware of the details beyond that.”
Another journalist raised their hand.
“Including the interview and photos, a total of five people were featured in Dasrothe’s report. The Imperial Times has already reported that there are recordings proving that three of these claims are false. Should we consider all of Dasrothe’s claims as lies?”
This one is trying to confirm that all of Dasrothe’s claims are false. I like their attitude.
I nodded and answered.
“Yes, absolutely. To reiterate, I have not been in any romantic relationship with anyone. This was true in the past and remains true now. The people Dasrothe featured in their materials are all individuals I have never even met.”
At that moment, the atmosphere among the journalists changed.
It wasn’t because of my words. They glanced at something written on a paper they had received and quickly spoke up.
“I have a question.”
“Yes.”
“Two minutes ago, the Bavarian Royal family warned that if Dasrothe continues to publish false articles attacking the Royal family’s authority, they will permanently expel Dasrothe’s Bavarian branch. Were you aware of this?”
Perfect timing.
Perhaps the Bavarian Royal family coordinated this to coincide with the Royal Investigation Bureau’s actions.
With the blow dealt by the search and seizure, it’s hard for Dasrothe to keep pushing the issue, and this firmly nails it down.
With Dasrothe’s credibility now in question, the Bavarian Royal family’s declaration effectively proves that all of Dasrothe’s claims are false.
This concludes it completely.
I smiled under my mask and looked at the broadcasting cameras, ready to speak.

Congratulations!
Proposal 3: [Impression] Score 5 Defense success!
Confirmed: Route 1 — 〈 Chapter 5. Good Things Take Time (1) 〉
I lay back comfortably and looked at the status window.
107 hours is about 4.5 days.
The proposal ended in a little over two days.
Since it had an "N" written, I thought it would last the full week, but that wasn’t the case.
And….
Yesterday, the last digits of the impression score were 2513.
Lucas Rene Askanian
Impression: -9.9 [+5.0025496]
Thanks to the purification report and the donation news being fully reported this morning, the score jumped almost tenfold.
Considering that the ending score was in the 15000s after the proposal appeared, it has risen even higher.
‘Finishing early means there’s no chance of the impression score dropping further within the week.’
With the preemptive donation, the search and seizure, and Bavaria’s expulsion warning all happening at once, Dasrothe could no longer continue the issue.
Instead, they even published articles subtly praising me.
They must have figured that pursuing it further would cause more harm than gain.
‘But that doesn’t mean I should stop.’
No matter how long the legal battle takes, I will ensure those bastards are dealt with.
Of course, filing a lawsuit as Nicolaus would only lead to my information being exposed, so I’ll proceed after revealing my identity as a student.
‘Still, increasing the score isn’t easy.’
Even after spending 4.2 billion, my score barely climbed to 6.
I closed my eyes and continued calculating in my head.
To raise my impression score by 4 more points, I'd need two or three more events like the live broadcast.
As the numbers get higher, it's increasingly difficult to boost them significantly, so expecting a 3-point jump from a single activity like before is unrealistic.
‘If I’m going to put in the effort, I should build my image more meticulously.’
As long as I continue attending school looking normal, my brother’s anxiety about Luca will inevitably grow.
I can't completely avoid school life as a student, so unless I drop out, "Luca" will be used up in the process.
Accepting the wariness towards Luca means I need to make Nicolaus even more secure.
At that moment, someone tapped the floor with their shoe.
Opening my eyes, I saw Leo standing by my head.
Not surprising. This is Leo's training ground, after all.
Leo gestured at me.
“Get up. Let’s train.”
“I’m sorry, but I came to tell you I can’t.”
“What? Why?”
Leo raised his eyebrows in surprise.
“There’s a lot I need to think about.”
“Think? You can think while training. I won’t say anything today.”
“……”
He increases the intensity of my training as my skills improve.
How can I think about other things during that? It’s amazing he thinks it’s possible.
Moreover, he always knows if I’m even slightly distracted during training and gives serious advice.
Now, it’s obvious he’s trying to coax me into training just because he wants to.
When I closed my eyes again without saying a word, Leo tried once more.
“We haven’t trained in over four days because of the council and Dasrothe. If we don’t, the hard-earned sense will fade. We need to practice consistently.”
What do I expect from this magic-obsessed guy?
I stood up suddenly and leaned against the wall.
“Maintaining my sense is important, but I need to build up my stamina to think properly. Let’s start again tomorrow.”
“Well… too bad, but okay.”
Leo, looking somewhat gaunt, sat down beside me.
It’s nice to see his magic-obsessed face again after a while.
But I still don’t feel like training.
Elias is still healing his leg, so he can’t train….
“Train with Narce. He’s good too.”
“Hmm….”
Judging by his response, they haven't built that kind of rapport yet.
Naturally. Other than our secret meetings, they haven’t done anything together, so they probably see each other as just classmates.
Come to think of it… being able to see others’ favorability could be useful.
‘…No, scratch that.’
I don't want a power that lets me see others' favorability.
It might be useful sometimes, but compared to Insight and such, it’s relatively useless.
Insight would be more helpful in seeing favorability between others.
If you’re going to give me something, give me Insight.
With that thought, I recalled who Leo trained with last year. Luca had no interest in how the class functioned, so no one came to mind.
“Who did you usually train with?”
“Just classmates, taking turns.”
“Then call them today and train.”
“Not necessary…. There’s too much pointless conversation to endure outside of training. So, what are you thinking about that you need to rest?”
Most of their conversations are indeed trivial gossip or family talk.
I nodded and answered his question.
“I’m planning to build Nicolaus’s achievements more meticulously. I need to plan it out in detail.”
“You’re trying to make Nicolaus like your brother, right?”
“Right. I need to build him up enough so that I won’t be undermined no matter what my brother says later.”
To do that, I need to lay a solid foundation.
Especially my still-flawed past and identification.
These parts need to be improved.
“By the way, it’s already November 15th. What about the monthly evaluation?”
The school postponed it indefinitely, and it's been a week with no news.
Leo frowned.
“We’re not supposed to talk about it until the day after tomorrow… but I guess you should know. Don’t mention it to anyone until then.”
“What is it?”
“They’re sending the magic department to clear a lower restricted area before the festival.”
“…Are they trying to get everyone killed?”
“…I wonder how the students would react if they knew the lowest scorer was dismissing them like this….”
Ignoring Leo’s chuckle, I smiled.
That’s just my surface score, anyway.
“So, why do I need to know this?”
“You’ll need to have your core re-examined. I told the professor it would be pointless, but they want to check everyone. There’s a lot of talk about the restricted area at the school, so they seem interested.”
“Hmm….”
“Also, because of suitability issues, the schedule got messed up. They’re discussing selecting students to send after testing them… but nothing’s confirmed yet. Are you just going to drink the potion?”
“Of course.”
It’s a good opportunity.
I can definitively reveal the state of my core to my brother. While it won’t completely reassure him, it will provide decent evidence.
I took Nicolaus’s identification from my bag, which was thrown far away.
Though it’s called an ID, it’s more like a mage registration card.
[Nikolaus Karl Bernhard Yoon Ernst]
The long name made me chuckle involuntarily, but making unnecessarily long names is a noble trait.
I couldn't omit the Korean surname inserted in the middle because of the records from my first restricted area visit, so I included it as one of my middle names.
Of course, that’s not the important part. What I wanted to check was this.
*Temporary Registration Card of the Royal Bavarian Magic Association*
*General Magic Level 5*
“Registered at level 5.”
“Yes. All temporary registration levels are based on the median value.”
I can’t stay with a temporary registration forever.
The expiration date is the end of this year.
There are only about a month and three weeks left….
“I need to go now. Do you have time? If not, I’ll go alone.”
“What, right now? Are we just going?”
“It has to be now.”
If the school checks my core, my brother will find out my core level.
By matching the timing of the core check with the ID issuance, I can partly avoid suspicion.
Suspicion from my brother, who sees Nicolaus as an object of observation.
The school probably wants to do some good by mobilizing students.
Thanks to that, I can blend in.
Ch 47: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family
Chapter 47
“Are you only here for the General Magic examination?”
“Yes.”
Once again in the guise of Nicolaus, I arrived in Bavaria to officially get my mage registration card issued and proceeded to the Royal Mage Association's examination site.
It’s best to update all core-related official documents now while the school is likely to mess things up. There's no time to delay.
“Your Highness, you are…”
“I am not.”
Leo, standing beside me, waved his hand slightly.
The staff member smiled, nodded, and spoke to me.
“Then, Sir Nicolaus, please proceed to Examination Room 1 on the upper floor.”
“How long will the examination take?”
“There are five sections, each taking about 1 to 5 minutes. Including the time to compile results, it should take less than 40 minutes in total. Ah, it might take twice as long for you, Sir Nicolaus.”
Twice as long?
Anyway, unlike the abbreviated core exam at the school, this examination, which will determine the values on my registration card, involves multiple assessments.
“What are the sections?”
“First, we will check your core, then measure the purity, intensity, and total amount of your magic power. Finally, we will test a spell at its maximum power to see if there are any blockages during the casting process.”
It was as I had researched beforehand.
I nodded briefly in greeting and went upstairs, opening the door to the examination room.
The examination room was completely empty.
I took off all my artifacts and placed them in the storage box, standing in front of the red tape marked on the floor.
A signboard was placed in front of me.
‘Raise your dominant hand.’
It was stated that the test would assess various aspects such as the hardness, capacity, and stability of the core.
Since I’m doing this, I hope I score at least 8 out of 10.
‘Where did your conscience go?’
Expecting to jump to an 8 after training for just two months, having been at zero, is a bit much.
Anyway, below that, it mentioned that the skin might tingle when the test magic flows.
A very… discouraging statement.
However, there was no need to delay what had to be done, so I raised my hand right away.
Crackle―!
“Ugh!”
I reflexively pulled my arm back and took a step back.
It felt like a needle had traveled through my veins to stab deep into my heart.
‘Whoever wrote that doesn’t understand the definition of a tingle.’
More importantly, do I need to redo it since I stopped midway?
I really don’t want to put my hand up again… let’s see.
Beep―
As I was looking to see if anything had changed, a red light appeared above the signboard.
Below the self-evaluation score, a percentile appeared.
Core Rating: Top 1%
“…1%?”
I couldn’t believe what I saw, so I closed my eyes for a moment and reopened them, but nothing changed.
It was truly 1%.
‘No matter how comprehensive the factors are, a core soaked in poison for over half a lifetime shouldn’t be this good.’
The examination is complete. Please proceed to Examination Room 2.
As soon as the message appeared, I left Examination Room 1 and moved next door.
And…
After pulling out the grade sheet from the final room, I returned to the staff member.
“All sections are within the top 1%. How is this possible?”
“That’s expected for someone of Sir Nicolaus’s caliber. Why are you asking how…?”
Leo murmured from behind.
The staff member nodded in agreement with Leo’s comment.
“It’s because of the recent adjustments in the examination. For those in the top 1% of each section, there’s a special examination for a more accurate measurement.”
“There’s another test?”
“Yes. It’s a recently added procedure, so it’s understandable you weren’t aware.”
If it’s within the top 1%, they transfer to a special test?
So I’ve passed the general level easily.
‘It’s surprising… perhaps I’ve underestimated my condition.’
From observing the status windows, it’s clear that many people have magic stats between 0 and 1.
Society doesn’t usually classify them as mages, but technically they are.
Given that 78% of the population falls into this category, my core surpassing 100 average mages isn’t too surprising.
My core rating being in the top 1% owes much to this statistic.
Now, I’ll compete with those who’ve also surpassed 99 out of 100 mages.
I wonder where I’ll rank among them.
I pondered over this while stroking my chin.
‘Anyway, I have to do the test again.’
Feeling my pulse quicken slightly, I returned to Examination Room 1.
Looking at the signboard instructing me to raise my hand again, I cleared my thoughts and placed my right hand on it. I just wanted to get it over with.
Bang― Crackle―!
“Whew….”
This time, knowing the intensity, I handled it smoothly.
Beep―
Core Rating: Top 40%
‘Hmm.’
Within the top 1%, my core ranks just above the median.
‘Not bad.’
Luca’s core was at level 9.
In two months, I’ve surpassed about 100 average mages and roughly 60 out of 100 top 1% mages.
I expected a lower score, but the fact that it’s above average suggests my core’s innate traits are good enough to counteract the damage.
The examination is complete. Please proceed to Examination Room 2.
Outside, I told Leo my percentile. Leo clicked his tongue with a dissatisfied look.
“Your core isn’t great. You should get treatment at Wittelsbach later.”
“…….”
I almost asked why he was still using formal speech here but kept quiet.
It’s wise to maintain decorum while moving around as Nicolaus, just in case.
I nodded at Leo and asked.
“What’s your percentile?”
“…What kind of phrasing is that…. When I first measured after the system was introduced, I was at 1%.”
“In the special examination.”
“Of course.”
“…….”
Silently, I moved to the next room.
Even without exceptional magical talent, he reached this level because his core was strong enough to support any effort. No amount of magic potions would burden him.
‘This test is for magic purity.’
I had checked it out earlier.
Fortunately, this test doesn’t involve being attacked by a machine. I just need to channel magic into holy water.
I briefly channeled magic into the holy water radiating divine energy.
Beep―
Top 0%
‘Hmm.’
As mentioned in the guidance note earlier, the values are rounded.
Anyway, the result was 0% in the general test, and it’s still 0% here.
I had guessed this might be the case since I can freely use Divine Power, but seeing it with my own eyes was even more satisfying.
Next, in terms of magic intensity and total amount, I scored in the top 4% and top 1%, respectively.
“I had a feeling when you could warp five or six times a day, but to be in the top 1% for total amount? That's impressive.”
Leo chuckled.
Warp magic consumes an excessive amount of magic power, so for our school's students, the maximum is one or two times a day.
But… for someone who says that, Leo never seemed to struggle with warping.
“What’s your total amount score…?”
“Top 13% or was it 11%? I didn't think it was low, but maybe I’m wrong.”
His school friends would want to punch him for that.
He’s got 89 people behind him in the top 1% category, and he thinks it's not low?
‘Anyway.’
My core is in the top 40%, and magic power is no lower than the top 4%.
