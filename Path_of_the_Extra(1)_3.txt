Another person, dressed in the white academy uniform, followed them in.

Since there were no first-year students yet, it was clear that this person was either a second or third year.

"It's been a while, hasn't it, Azriel! How was your trip to CASC?"

Solomon greeted with a wide smile.

Azriel returned a slight smile.

"It was a comfortable ride. Unfortunately, I left EASC at the last minute, so I haven't had the chance to do any sightseeing yet, Instructor Solomon."

As Instructor Juliet closed the door behind them, Solomon burst into laughter.

He insisted that Azriel should definitely check out the Sacred Capital and playfully reminded him that he shouldn't call him "Instructor" just yet, as Azriel wasn't officially a first-year student.

The sad truth, however, was that nearly everyone present for the entrance exam was almost guaranteed acceptance unless there was a compelling reason otherwise.

The void creatures were nightmarish adversaries, and humanity couldn't afford to be selective about those willing to fight against them.

Even if the students lacked talent, as long as they were willing to become heroes and fight for humanity, it was better than nothing in the academy's eyes.

Despite the surge of courage that brought many to join the academy, more than half would likely back out by the end of the year—if not sooner, at the upcoming void dungeon challenge, which was a rite of passage for first-years.

The real purpose of the void dungeon was to test the students' resolve, to see who had the mental fortitude to push forward and become a hero.

You couldn't become a hero with a weak mentality.

For Azriel, however, passing the entrance exam was a foregone conclusion.

While others might face a slim chance of failure, his status as a prince ensured he would pass, no matter what.

The entrance exam was more of a formality to gauge the talent pool and determine who would rise as the apex among the first-years.

But in Freya's eyes, that question was already answered.

Azriel was destined to be the apex of the first year.

He was simply perfect for the role she envisioned him playing in the future.

Instructor Juliet returned to her seat with the other instructors, while the older student walked toward the center of the room, standing before the assembled instructors and the headmistress.

Azriel followed suit, positioning himself beside the student.

"Azriel Crimson, to pass the exam, all you have to do is show us what you've got. Don't worry about holding back—Cadet Chad is a third-year student who can handle himself since he's also a Grade 3 Intermediate."

Freya explained.

Azriel narrowed his eyes in response, analyzing the situation.

"In other words, just impress us!"

Solomon added excitedly, a grin spreading across his face.

'A Grade 3 Intermediate and a third-year, huh? She knows I'm at least on Caleus's level, if not higher…'

Azriel thought, weighing his options.

Being a Grade 3 Intermediate in the third year wasn't particularly impressive.

By that stage, it was expected for students to be at least an Advanced grade.

Azriel's gaze shifted to Cadet Chad, who stood rigidly, cold sweat beading on his forehead as he stared straight ahead, seemingly paralyzed under Freya's piercing gaze.

'He must be scraping the bottom of his year, but for any normal candidate, he would've been more than enough for this exam.'

But this year's candidates were far from normal.

'She must have deliberately chosen him, knowing I could handle him easily… Is she trying to make it difficult for me to conceal my true rank?'

Azriel smiled slightly at Freya, nodding as he moved to the side of the room, putting some distance between himself and Cadet Chad.

The poor guy was probably roped into this to earn some extra points.

Azriel couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for him.

But he also knew exactly what Freya was thinking.

If there had been one person he was most wary of at the banquet, it was Freya.

Even now, he knew that underestimating her would be a grave mistake.

By this point, Freya had likely already decided that Azriel was destined to be the apex of the first-years, which was…

'Perfect.'

The only reason things were going so smoothly for him was perhaps because Freya was too focused on achieving her own goals.

Otherwise, he was certain she would have seen through him at the banquet.

'She'll figure it all out by the end of today, I suppose…'

With that thought, Azriel summoned Void Eater, positioning the blade in front of him with both hands gripping the hilt firmly.

Cadet Chad stood in the center, holding a bow and arrow, his eyes not betraying any arrogance.

Instead, they were filled with wariness—likely due to the rumors surrounding Azriel and the fact that he was a prince of the Crimson Clan.

As they awaited the signal to begin, Azriel spoke, his voice calm but commanding.

"Don't blink."

*****

Watching Azriel prepare, Freya felt a thrill of satisfaction.

No one but her knew the truth behind what was about to unfold.

Cadet Chad was struggling—still only a Grade 3 Intermediate—and Freya had struck a deal with him.

She promised to help him grow stronger, a promise she genuinely intended to keep.

But there was one condition: he had to lose miserably when facing Azriel Crimson in the entrance exam.

That was all he had to do.

Freya knew that making Azriel the apex of the first years wouldn't be easy.

She would need to convince the other instructors in the room, except for Solomon and Ranni, who were already on her side.

There was a limit to how much she could achieve on her own.

Even Azriel, for all his cunning, was limited in what he could do.

Freya understood that he was trying to raise his reputation as a prince, especially after the stunts he pulled at the banquet.

Many influential figures would question how someone like him could not become the apex.

It simply wouldn't make sense.

But Freya couldn't quite grasp his endgame.

What was his goal?

Why go to such lengths?

She didn't care how Azriel had obtained information about the Neo Genesis attack.

All she wanted was for him to seize the spotlight.

At most, Freya predicted that Azriel would aim to place himself in the top 25, trying to avoid too much attention.

But with Chad as his opponent, Azriel would inevitably emerge as the apex.

Then she heard him speak.

"Don't blink."

Those words snapped her out of her thoughts. Azriel stood ready, his stance poised for attack, while Chad assumed a defensive position.

But something was wrong—Azriel's expression wasn't as blank as it had been at the banquet.

'Something's off…'

Freya narrowed her eyes, an uneasy feeling settling over her.

She didn't like the look Azriel was giving.

It felt like something was missing, something she hadn't accounted for.

'What is he planning?'

"You may begin."

Instructor Salvator announced.

The instant those words left his mouth, every instructor in the room sat up straight—even Ranni and Solomon.

""...!""

A black mist suddenly erupted from Azriel's body, coiling around him like a snake.

It seeped from his mouth, nostrils, and breath.

'That stench...!'

Freya recognized it immediately.

If the smell of death on Azriel had been a faint flicker before, it was now a blazing inferno.

Her skin crawled with disgust, goosebumps rising as she watched.

Cadet Chad, too, was affected.

Goosebumps appeared on his arms as he gripped his bow tighter, hurriedly nocking an arrow.

The terror on his face was unmistakable—he had forgotten the condition of their deal.

And it didn't end there.

Red lightning began to crackle, merging with the black mist.

The floor froze beneath them as the tips of Azriel's hair turned white.

'Dual affinities, just like his sister!?'

Fwoosh—!

Chad loosed his arrow, but the moment he blinked, Azriel was gone.

"Huh...?"

The sound of the arrow hitting the ice echoed through the room.

Chad turned to see it split perfectly in two.

"Beautiful…"

Ranni's voice broke the silence, awe-stricken.

Cadet Chad couldn't move.

The cold, metallic sensation of a blade resting against his neck kept him frozen in place.

It took a few seconds for him to regain his senses, and when he did, he saw a shattered path of ice before him.

He felt someone's cold breath on his nape.

Black mist with red lightning coiled gently around the broken ice and Chad's body, before transforming into dark roses with red lightning crackling through them.

Then, just as suddenly, they vanished into thin air.

"A-ah…"

Cadet Chad finally understood.

He had lost—miserably.

Chapter 47: The Apex
The room descended into an uncomfortable silence as Azriel retracted Void Eater.

Cadet Chad stood there, despairing, his head hanging low.

Clap-!

Instructor Salvator clapped his hands together, the sound echoing through the room.

"That was outstanding, Cadet Azriel. Please remain inside the academy—you'll be guided to your room at the end of the day when the rankings are decided. The overall rankings of all students will be revealed the day after tomorrow when classes commence."

Instructor Salvator's respectful tone made it clear that Azriel's passage was a foregone conclusion, even before the entrance exam had taken place.

Being addressed as "Cadet" was a sign of the instructor's acknowledgment.

Azriel simply nodded and left Chad and the instructors behind.

He avoided looking at Solomon or Freya, his thoughts unsettled.

Quite frankly, he was a little afraid to see Freya's expression right now.

'...I did what I had to do.'

He reassured himself as he stepped outside, ignoring the gazes of the other prospective students waiting for their turn.

"Prince Azriel."

The staff member who had escorted him earlier was there, waiting with a slight bow.

"Allow me to guide you to a room where you can relax while waiting for the results."

Azriel nodded, but then paused.

"Wait."

The staff member looked at him questioningly.

"What is your name?"

"Ah, my name is Daniel, just Daniel, my prince."

Azriel nodded once more.

"Daniel. I shall remember your name."

*****

Not long after Azriel left, the instructors decided to continue the exam, bringing in the other priority students.

As expected, the priority students performed extremely well, showcasing their abilities.

Fortunately, after Azriel's display, Cadet Chad managed to save face with the following candidates, though it was clear that the incoming students this year were particularly talented.

Or at least, that's what everyone in the room believed—until the turn of a certain blonde-haired student.

The student's performance was so overwhelming that it ended with Cadet Chad being accidentally sent to the infirmary.

To say the instructors and the headmistress were surprised would be an understatement.

They were utterly shocked.

Another student capable of defeating a Grade 3 Intermediate, just like Azriel.

After that incident, another third-year was called upon to continue the exams.

Fortunately, the remainder of the entrance exams proceeded without further issues.

After the third-year student left the room, a heavy silence settled among the instructors.

No one spoke, each lost in their own thoughts.

The students this year had remarkable potential.

If they had taken the entrance exam three years ago, deciding who would gain the title of Apex would have been a difficult task for the instructors.

Fortunately—or perhaps unfortunately—just like last year, the choice for who would gain the title of Apex seemed obvious.

Or at least it should have been, if not for a certain blonde-haired student.

"...Shall we vote?"

Instructor Juliet finally broke the silence, her voice tired as she looked around at her colleagues with a weary smile.

The long day of evaluating students had taken its toll on everyone.

Instructor Salvator nodded and picked up the documents in front of him.

"The candidates for the title of Apex are as follows."

He began, clearing his throat.

"Azriel, Anastasia, Celestina, Yelena, Vergil, and... Lumine."

The six names Salvator listed were the top contenders for the title, but it was clear that only two of them truly stood out.

"Looks like we have some dark horses this year, huh..."

Ranni remarked, flashing a wry smile as she reviewed the documents.

"I think we can all agree that the Apex this year will be either Azriel Crimson or Lumine Versille."

Instructor Salvator said, and the others nodded in agreement—except for Freya, who appeared deep in thought.

'Why... why did he do that?'

Freya's mind raced as she replayed everything Azriel had done so far.

None of it made sense.

His actions during the entrance exam didn't align with the plan he was supposed to follow—the plan he had told her about.

Freya had been confident she had fooled Azriel into believing she supported his plan.

So why hadn't he followed through?

Why didn't he hold back as he said he would?

As she considered every detail about Azriel Crimson, something suddenly clicked in her mind.

"...!"

Her eyes widened in realization.

'It was a decoy!?'

"Heh. You figured it out faster than I thought."

Solomon said lightly from beside her, making her turn to him.

He was smiling, as usual.

The plan Azriel had presented was a decoy all along—a plan he genuinely intended to use, making Freya believe in it as well.

But the truth was, Azriel had switched plans the moment the banquet ended.

'Why...?'

Before she could voice her thoughts, she realized something that made her skin crawl.

She didn't want to believe it, but...

"How...?"

She muttered, her voice barely audible.

The other instructors, noticing the tension between Freya and Solomon, looked confused.

Solomon simply shrugged.

"I have no clue, honestly... but we were lucky. Extremely lucky."

'Lucky, huh...'

Freya thought.

Yes, they were indeed fortunate.

Because if she had seen through the ruse earlier, everything would have been for nothing.

"I told you, didn't I? You shouldn't underestimate one another."

"..."

'...I really did underestimate him. But how did Azriel know?'

Freya wondered, now more curious than ever.

Before, she might not have cared, but now?

Now she was dying to know.

'For once, I'm glad I underestimated him...'

She didn't want to imagine what would have happened if she hadn't.

"What's wrong?"

Instructor Juliet asked, noticing the odd exchange.

"It's nothing, really. Just us grown-ups talking, so don't worry about it. Let's just make Azriel the Apex and be done with it—my butt's starting to hurt!"

Solomon replied, waving off the conversation.

Instructor Juliet frowned.

"Lumine Versille is still a possibility for being the Apex, Solomon."

Knowing she wouldn't get answers from Freya or Solomon, Juliet steered the conversation back to the decision at hand.

"He is not."

Instructor Salvator interjected, while Ranni nodded as if she knew what he was about to say.

"And why is that?"

Juliet asked, confused.

"Perhaps if Azriel Crimson wasn't one of the students this year, then yes, Lumine Versille would have been the Apex. But that's not the case."

Salvator explained.

"Why does that matter? Both defeated a Grade 3 Intermediate. In fact, I'd say Lumine is a better candidate since the current Apex for the second year is already Jasmine Crimson. It's always been a child of one of the great clans who's the Apex in their year. The students would find it motivating to see that someone else could top a prince or princess."

Instructor Salvator shook his head.

"I think you've forgotten the true meaning of the Apex title. It's meant for the strongest, for someone who will lead the students when necessary. It isn't something you give for social and motivational reasons.

Would you trust someone unknown who somehow managed to defeat a Grade 3 Intermediate, or Azriel Crimson, a prince of the Crimson Clan, who has presumably survived the Void Realm on his own for two years?"

Instructor Juliet fell silent at his words.

It was true—people would rather trust a prince with a rumored history of survival than an unknown student.

"And, currently, Azriel Crimson is indeed stronger than Lumine Versille."

Salvator continued, noticing Juliet's confusion.

"Cadet Chad was defeated by Lumine Versille, but they fought, didn't they? The same could be said for Azriel Crimson, no?"

Juliet looked at him, her expression questioning.

"It cannot be said the same."

Salvator stated firmly.

Suddenly, Juliet's eyes widened in realization.

"Azriel Crimson didn't fight Cadet Chad. That wasn't a fight—it was a halted execution. If the prince had desired, he could have killed the poor guy ten times over without him knowing what happened. Unlike Lumine Versille, who genuinely had to exchange blows."

"Oh..."

Instructor Juliet could only exclaim in realization as she comprehended Instructor Salvator's point.

Azriel had finished the exam faster than anyone else.

Unlike the other students, he hadn't engaged in a fight or even laid a scratch on Cadet Chad, yet he had defeated him with overwhelming ease.

Azriel had the power to hurt—or even kill—Cadet Chad if he had chosen to, but he had refrained from doing so.

"...If anyone objects to Azriel Crimson being named the Apex, please raise your hand."

Freya's unexpected announcement drew the attention of the room.

The instructors, who had thought Freya was lost in thought, looked up in surprise.

Yet, no one raised their hand.

In the end, Freya and Azriel's goals had aligned.

She wanted him to be the Apex, and so did Azriel.

It was mutually beneficial.

However, Freya now had a new concern—a dangerous one—that she would need to address promptly.

'I'm starting to understand how he managed to survive the Void Realm.'

She thought, shaking her head as she met the gazes of the other instructors.

"Then it's official: Azriel Crimson is hereby named the Apex of the first years."

Chapter 48: Drunk Azriel
"Congratulations on becoming the Apex for the first years, Prince Azriel."

Daniel said, standing beside Azriel in front of the door to his new room.

This room would be his home until the end of his academy days—unless, of course, he lost the title of Apex.

Azriel hummed, his gaze fixed on the door.

'To think I actually became the Apex...'

A title that was originally meant for the protagonist was now his, because he had survived and attended the academy.

Not only that, but the very room that was supposed to belong to the protagonist was now his as well.

Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Azriel turned to Daniel.

"Daniel... do you wish to retire?"

"...Pardon?"

Daniel looked puzzled, unsure if he had heard correctly.

Azriel turned to him with a small, knowing smile.

"What I mean is, would you like to stop working from now on?"

Daniel's eyes widened in shock.

"Ah! M-my prince, I need this job to feed my family... I can't afford to lose it."

Azriel chuckled softly.

"I think you're misunderstanding me. What I'm proposing is that if you do something for me, I'll make sure you're taken care of."

Daniel blinked in surprise.

"...Something for you?"

Azriel nodded.

"Yes. In exchange, I'll ensure you have enough money to retire comfortably for the rest of your life. Your children, your grandchildren—they'll never need to work again."

Daniel swallowed hard, his heart pounding as he considered Azriel's words.

The offer was incredibly tempting.

As a prince of the Crimson Clan, Azriel had the resources to back up his promises.

There was no reason to doubt his sincerity, given his status.

Unable to resist the temptation, Daniel nodded meekly.

"W-what do I need to do?"

Azriel's smile widened, and for a moment, Daniel felt a shiver run down his spine as he looked into those blood-red eyes.

"Nothing too difficult—just a simple task."

Azriel placed a hand on Daniel's shoulder, causing him to flinch.

"You know the instructor named Juliet, right?"

Daniel, though still confused, nodded.

"Excellent... Here's what I need you to do."

Azriel then proceeded to explain his plan, detailing exactly what Daniel had to do to secure his financial future.

Azriel had been fully aware of all the instructors in the room during his exam earlier that day.

He knew each of them, and he was also aware of Instructor Juliet's negative views toward the children of the four great clans.

'In the book, Celestina, Jasmine, and Caleus had quite a headache dealing with her all the time...'

Back then, Juliet hadn't been much of a problem, perhaps because Lumine had been the Apex.

But now?

Azriel wasn't willing to take that risk.

He had noticed the way Juliet had looked at him during the exam, and he wasn't going to sit idly by if she tried anything.

After explaining his plan to the shocked but compliant Daniel, Azriel finally entered his new home leaving him behind.

"Wow..."

Azriel was awestruck as he took in his new home.

The room was luxurious, perched high above the city with floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a breathtaking view of CASC.

The living room was a perfect blend of sleek modern design and comfort—plush, cream-colored sofas were arranged around a low glass coffee table, with subtle gold accents hinting at quiet opulence.

Azriel wandered further into the room.

"I'm certainly glad I decided to become the Apex."

At the far end of the room, a balcony extended outward.

Azriel stepped out onto it, looking down at the academy sprawling below.

"Would I die if I jumped from this height?"

As crazy as it might sound, he wasn't a normal human.

His curiosity about the limits of a grade 3 intermediate was piqued.

Azriel shook his head with a slight chuckle.

"...I'll try another day."

Definitely another day.

"I'm pretty sure you'd break a few bones from this height... you know, like all 206 of them."

A familiar voice teased from behind.

Azriel smiled softly as he recognized the voice.

"You forgot how to knock?"

Azriel turned around to see Solomon leaning casually against the couch.

"Heh, just came to congratulate you on becoming the Apex. We should celebrate!"

Azriel had to resist the urge to let his lips twitch in annoyance.

'Still doesn't excuse him from not knocking!'

He sighed, giving in.

"Fine..."

Azriel made his way to the kitchen, opening the cabinets.

'I wonder if it's actually here...'

In the book, when this room belonged to the protagonist, he had discovered something in one of the cabinets.

And that something was...

'Ha! Here it is!'

A collection of fine wines.

Azriel turned around with a grin.

"Tell me, Solomon, red or white?"

"Huh... have you gone crazy?"

Solomon scoffed, but his grin matched Azriel's.

"All of them."

Since the first Void Generation, global restrictions on teenage alcohol consumption had been relaxed.

The new regulations allowed anyone aged 15 or older who was a Grade 3 Awakened to drink, provided they had the consent of their legal guardian.

Luckily—or perhaps not—Azriel met all the conditions, or at least all except the last one, but no one would really check on that.

Besides, even if Azriel hadn't met the conditions, the consequences would have been negligible.

No one would be foolish enough to challenge a prince over something like that.

Both Azriel and Solomon settled onto stools behind the counter.

"I thought you didn't like alcohol."

Solomon said, eyeing Azriel.

"You didn't touch a drop at the banquet."

Azriel shrugged, his gaze fixed on the bottle in his hands.

"I don't."

He replied.

"I absolutely loathe it. It makes me want to vomit just from touching it. I'd rather gnaw off my own limbs."

Solomon raised an eyebrow, watching Azriel with curiosity as he took a sip.

"Then why the hell are you drinking?"

Azriel chuckled.

"Maybe I'll tell you one day."

Solomon clicked his tongue in frustration.

"Fine! keep your secrets. But don't expect that stunt with Freya to work again. She's already figured it out."

Azriel took a deep gulp of wine and nodded toward Solomon.

"Yeah, but it was necessary. We didn't have another option, did we?"

"Oh, I know. She's dying to meet you, but if she does, it might jeopardize the plan. Can't blame her—I have questions of my own."

Azriel shook his head.

"I told you, if you ask me, you might never get what you truly want."

"Yeah, yeah, I know. But it would be bad for me if you died next week."

"I won't."

Azriel said, his tone growing serious as he looked intently at Solomon.

His cheeks were slightly flushed.

"But expect everything we planned to go to shit."

Solomon grinned.

"It already was."

*****

Jasmine stood in front of the door to Azriel's new living quarters—the same room she had occupied last year as the apex of the first years.

Now, as the apex of the second years and the student council president, she had intended to congratulate Azriel tomorrow instead of today.

To her, it wasn't surprising that Azriel had become the apex.

Unless he chose otherwise, it was a given in her eyes—after all, he was her little brother.

It was only natural.

But she had changed her mind.

Instead of waiting until tomorrow, she decided to visit today.

Because...

'He didn't find my collection, did he?'

A cold sweat broke out on her forehead.

Surely not.

It hadn't even been a full day.

'Maybe he's already asleep?'

Jasmine remembered that she might have accidentally left her precious wine collection behind when she moved out.

With everything happening around Azriel's return, it had slipped her mind.

'I don't even remember him drinking before...'

Surely, the bottles would be safe.

She knocked lightly on the door and heard voices from within.

"Coming, coming! Solomon, don't tell me you invited people over for a party now?"

"Pfft, please, as if this small place could handle a party of mine!"

'Solomon?'

Jasmine recognized the voices instantly.

How could she not?

She knew they were acquainted but hadn't realized Azriel was that close with him.

When the door opened, her attention shifted to the person standing before her.

Azriel leaned against the doorframe, his shirt unbuttoned, revealing his skin, his hair tousled.

His cheeks were flushed red, and he looked slightly disheveled.

Behind him, Solomon was sprawled on the couch in a similar state, a bottle balanced precariously on his chest.

"Oh? My dear sister graces us with her presence! Here to join us for a drink?"

"Don't tell me—"

Jasmine's eyes widened in disbelief.

She didn't want to believe it.

'Drunk Azriel...'

If anyone else had seen Azriel in his current state, they might have found him in some sort of way charming.

But for Jasmine?

'So cute!'

Chapter 49: Cemetery
"I messed up…"

Lumine walked through the empty corridors, his footsteps echoing with each step.

His face was grim as he replayed yesterday's entrance exam in his mind.

It was currently 11:00 p.m., and most students had either returned to their rooms or gone out for the evening, leaving the academy eerily quiet.

Except for Lumine.

"I didn't even become the apex..."

The realization had hit him the moment he was shown to his room—on the floor just below the highest one.

It was a clear sign: Lumine was ranked second, not first.

He had failed the quest.

Since then, he hadn't left his room, too disheartened to face anyone.

Thankfully, his childhood friend Yelena hadn't pressed the matter, giving him space to process everything.

"It's my own fault."

Lumine muttered, his voice laced with frustration.

What truly gnawed at him wasn't just losing the apex title, but the events that transpired during the entrance exam.

"If only I had controlled my powers better…!"

Lumine had been trained by the system to fight void creatures and survive in the void realm, but humans?

That was a different story.

It hadn't even been a year since he'd acquired the system, which allowed him to unlock countless skills, affinities, and even buy health potions using the system points he earned from quests.

But never had he been tasked with fighting another human.

This was his first time.

Now, he understood a critical flaw: having power didn't mean mastering it.

"I need to fix this."

If he had better control over his abilities, he wouldn't have accidentally sent that cadet to the infirmary.

He needed more training.

"The system won't be able to help me with this…"

Trying to shake off the gloom, Lumine continued to explore the academy.

The place was vast, and he chuckled to himself, thinking he might get lost if he wasn't careful.

Still, he knew he couldn't wander for too long.

Tomorrow, classes would start, and it was better to get some rest.

He had no idea who the apex really was, even though they lived just one floor above him.

He didn't want to seem annoying by seeking them out.

"I wonder if it's him…"

Azriel Crimson.

The name had been circulating in rumors—stories of the prince who would attend the academy.

Unfortunately, neither Lumine nor Yelena had caught a glimpse of him.

They didn't even know what he looked like.

If Azriel was indeed the apex, Lumine was relieved he hadn't gone knocking on his door yet.

Who could blame him?

Even if Azriel was the most mysterious of the princes, with a past shrouded in negativity before his two-year disappearance, he was still a prince.

Lumine couldn't afford to accidentally offend him.

As Lumine wandered through the dimly lit corridors, his mind lost in thought, he suddenly came to an abrupt halt.

"What is that...?"

In the soft glow of the sparse lights, the corridors seemed cloaked in shadow.

Yet, ahead of him, an azure glow pierced through the darkness, making him squint.

It was a tiny, floating blue orb that danced in the air, casting an ethereal light on its surroundings.

The orb shimmered with a gentle luminescence, beckoning him closer.

With no one around, Lumine moved forward cautiously.

Each step he took seemed to dim the light, but the orb remained steadfast in its brilliance.

As he drew nearer, the orb's light softened, allowing him to see clearly.

Lumine froze in awe.

It wasn't a mere orb—it was a butterfly.

Its wings were a mesmerizing expanse of blue, alive with a radiant shimmer that seemed to pulse with an inner light.

The wingspan, nearly the length of his hand, fluttered gracefully, catching the faintest glimmers of light and painting the air with an enchanting dance of colors.

The butterfly's beauty was otherworldly, and Lumine, captivated, extended a trembling finger towards it.

As if sensing his intention, the butterfly alighted gently on his finger.

A smile unwittingly spread across Lumine's face.

There was something profoundly serene about this delicate creature, an inexplicable calm that washed over him.

Suddenly, the butterfly took flight, circling around his head before darting away.

Lumine's eyes widened in surprise.

"Hey, wait up!"

An inexplicable urge drove him to follow.

The butterfly fluttered ahead, moving leisurely despite its absence of a mana core, and Lumine, driven by a curious sense of purpose, ran after it.

The corridors blurred past him as he sprinted, his breath growing ragged and his legs aching.

He was grateful no one was around to witness his frenzied chase.

Bursting out into the open, Lumine continued his pursuit under the starlit sky.

But as the butterfly turned a corner, it vanished from sight.

Panting heavily, Lumine searched desperately, his eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of the creature.

Sweat clung to his skin, and exhaustion weighed on him as he trudged forward.

Suddenly, he came to a halt.

In his distracted state, he had wandered into an unfamiliar place.

His breath caught in his throat as he took in his surroundings.

All around him were rows upon rows of tombstones.

"I didn't know the academy had such a place..."

His voice came out as a hushed whisper, as if speaking louder might disturb the tranquility of the resting souls.

A pang of guilt pricked at him for his earlier heedless sprint through this solemn ground.

Slowly, he walked among the gravestones, reading the names etched into the stone—names he didn't recognize.

The dates of birth and death varied widely: some from over fifty years ago, others from just ten years past, and some from this very year.

Flowers adorned the stones, adding a touch of color to the otherwise somber scene.

Lumine was about to resign himself to the fact that the butterfly was nowhere to be found when he abruptly stopped again.

Standing directly in his path was a stranger—a person he had never seen before.

His hair was a deep, obsidian black, and his eyes were a striking crimson that mirrored the intensity of the setting sun.

He stared at the tombstones with an expression of solemn contemplation.

The stranger, though appearing no older than Lumine, carried an aura of maturity beyond his years.

Lumine hesitated, unsure whether this individual was a fellow student or an instructor, and uncertain how to approach.

Not wanting to intrude, Lumine was about to turn away, but their eyes met.

The intensity of the crimson gaze seemed to freeze him in place, and he felt an inexplicable itch on his back before it quickly faded.

The stranger, equally surprised to see Lumine here at this hour, quickly regained his composure.

A gentle smile appeared on his face.

"It's nice to meet you. My name is Azriel Crimson."

Chapter 50: Two at the Top
Lumine felt the words catch in his throat like a lump.

'Azriel? The Azriel Crimson?!'

Not even an hour ago, he had been thinking about how much he didn't want to meet this guy—yet here he was, standing right in front of him.

Lumine never imagined he would encounter the Crimson Prince in a cemetery of all places.

He took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves.

To be honest, for some reason, he had pictured the Crimson Prince looking more… regal.

Instead, Azriel was dressed in a simple black hoodie and cargo pants, watching Lumine with an amused yet patient gaze.

"…It's an honor to meet you, Prince Azriel. My name is Lumine Versille. I'm a student like you and ranked second among the first-years. I didn't mean to disturb you here or show any disrespect."

Lumine's words tumbled out so quickly, and he avoided Azriel's gaze so completely, that he surprised even himself.

'Why am I so nervous…?'

A few seconds passed, and the air around them grew increasingly awkward as Lumine continued to avoid Azriel's eyes, neither of them speaking.

Until Azriel suddenly burst into laughter.

"Eh?"

"Gods! Why are you so tense? Is it because of my face?"

Hearing this, Lumine's lips twitched.

"Uh, no, it's—"

"I know, I know, it's because I'm a prince. Relax, you don't need to treat me so politely. It just makes me more uncomfortable."

Azriel reassured him as he walked up to Lumine and patted his shoulder, making Lumine sigh in relief.

"Right. Sorry, I thought I might have disturbed your visit to someone here."

Azriel shook his head.

"Unfortunately, I don't know a single soul buried in these grounds."

"Oh."

That meant he was just walking here, Lumine realized.

He could have sworn Azriel had looked a little sadly at the tombstones earlier.

'Is he really such a nice person?'

Lumine glanced curiously at Azriel, who smiled back at him.

It wasn't that he thought the children of the great clans were bad people, but very little was known about the prince standing before him.

The rumors that had circulated before Azriel's disappearance were mostly negative—allegations of unworthiness, illegal activities, and scandalous behavior.

'I guess I shouldn't believe those rumors, though…'

"You said you were ranked second, right? That means you're in the room below me…"

Lumine's eyes widened.

'So he is the apex!'

At least that question was answered for him.

Lumine nodded at Azriel.

"Yes. I was thinking about visiting you yesterday or today, but I had some personal reasons, which is why I couldn't."

Azriel shook his head.

"It's fine. It's probably better that you didn't visit me yesterday or earlier today. I was out of it. Hell, I can't even remember what I did with that stupid clown."

Azriel sighed wearily, placing a hand on his shoulder as Lumine looked at him, puzzled.

"A word of advice: don't drink knowing you'll blackout when you have a sister you can't trust to be responsible. Especially when she leaves a letter saying you're not allowed to drink alone from now on…"

"Oh…"

Lumine nodded, taking in the interesting advice.

Suddenly, he froze.

'Wait, he said sister? So he must be talking about Jasmine Crimson, right?'

Unlike Azriel, his elder sister was much more well-known, having been the previous apex last year among her many achievements.

"Something wrong?"

"Ah, no, it's nothing…"

Lumine quickly shook his head.

An idea suddenly crossed his mind.

Even though it might backfire, it couldn't hurt to try, especially since Azriel seemed like a nice guy… hopefully.

"Can I ask you for some advice?"

"...?"

Azriel looked at him, surprised, before smiling and nodding.

"Of course. But I'm starving. Can we grab a bite at the cafeteria? I'm sure no one is there at this hour."

Lumine nodded at the suggestion.

He was starving as well, after chasing the strange butterfly he couldn't quite catch up to, even as a grade 3 intermediate.

'It must have flown off somewhere far...'

*****

The cafeteria was just as Azriel had said—empty.

No students were in sight as Lumine took a seat opposite Azriel, who was munching on fries from a bowl in front of him.

Lumine had ordered the same but hadn't started eating yet.

Instead, he watched Azriel with curiosity as he ate with a smile on his face.

When Azriel noticed him staring, he looked up, confused.

"Is something wrong?"

Lumine shook his head.

"No, it just seemed like you were really enjoying yourself."

A look of understanding crossed Azriel's face.

"I am. Trust me, you begin to appreciate things like food once you've genuinely worked until you almost collapse for it."

'Isn't he a prince? Why would he…'

Suddenly, Lumine felt a chill run down his spine.

It seemed ridiculous, but he recalled a rumor from a news report about Azriel spending two years in the Void Realm.

If that rumor was true, it would explain why no one had heard from him during that time.

The rumor about him attending the academy was true, so it made sense if he had been in the Void Realm for the past two years.

But if it was true…

Lumine couldn't imagine what it must have been like.

Even for him, having ventured into the Void Realm only a handful of times—with each experience almost costing his life despite numerous safety measures—the thought of spending two years there was unfathomable.

He wanted to ask more about it but stopped himself.

It wasn't why he was here, and he didn't want to broach a potentially sensitive subject if the rumors were true.

"So, what was it you needed my advice on?"

Azriel asked between mouthfuls of fries.

Lumine nodded, feeling a bit awkward but determined.

Despite how it might sound to some, he had a problem he wanted to solve quickly, and who better to ask than the person who had defeated him?

An opportunity had presented itself right in front of him.

"…I need help controlling my powers."

Azriel's hand paused with a fry halfway to his mouth before he ate it, a sigh escaping his lips.

The two of them sat in silence, studying each other.

"You sent poor Chad to the infirmary, didn't you?"

Azriel broke the silence first.

Lumine's lips twitched.

"That was an accident… which is why I need your help."

Azriel's eyes held a hint of amusement.

"Asking for help from the person sitting on the throne of the first years when you're someone who poses the biggest threat to overthrow me?"

Lumine didn't respond.

He knew it was a bit foolish to ask, but it was worth a try.

"…Luckily for you, I don't really care about my throne."

Lumine's eyes widened.

"But I have to ask—why do you think I'm capable of helping you? Even if I'm the apex, how do you know I haven't injured Chad just like you? Why do you assume I'm stronger?"

"Five. That's how many times I've attacked Chad. I tried to end it in three but failed miserably. Still, I defeated him without him even scratching me. That means you either attacked him even less or Chad forfeited before you got a chance to attack."

Azriel smiled at him.

"You're stronger than me. I know this might sound strange, but I can just sense it. You're a grade 3 intermediate like me, but you're… stronger."

Azriel continued to smile at him for a few seconds before shaking his head slightly.

"That feeling you have is what people in the Four Great Clans call battle sense. Not many develop it so early on like you have."

As Azriel resumed eating his fries, Lumine listened intently.

"Even though we humans can't really check each other's mana cores like we can with Void creatures, we have battle sense to make up for it. You can only develop this early on with talent and… killing a bunch of Void creatures."

'I see…'

The information Azriel shared was valuable.

Lumine was pleased to have developed such a skill over the past year.

"I won't ask how you managed to kill so many Void creatures, but make use of the fact that you did. Trust your battle sense."

Lumine nodded, appreciating the advice.

"But what about controlling my powers?"

Azriel placed his hand against his cheek, looking disappointed at the empty bowl.

"I just told you, didn't I? Just as you developed battle sense, you will eventually gain control over your powers through combat against humans."

Azriel continued.

"Sure, I could spar with you, but in my opinion, it would be a waste of time. You'll face countless life-or-death situations in the future where you'll have to fight humans, whether to kill them or not. Only by patiently taking your time will you master your powers correctly."

Lumine looked a bit disappointed that the advice didn't offer a quick solution, but he understood why Azriel had said what he did.

'I'm rushing things... I need to be more patient.'

Despite that, the advice was still valuable.

He had learned a lot from the person in front of him.

'I wonder if he has battle sense like me...'

Though he wanted to ask, he decided it was better not to.

As Lumine reached for his bowl, he noticed he couldn't grab any fries.

Furrowing his brows, he looked down and saw that his bowl was empty.

"Huh?"

Turning his head quickly towards Azriel, he saw him stuffing his mouth with fries from Lumine's bowl.

"…What?"

A wry smile appeared on Lumine's face as he shook his head.

"Nothing."

'I guess it's a fair trade.'

Lumine was amused by Azriel's behavior as he watched him devour the last of the fries.

Finally, they both decided to call it a night, as it was already 1 a.m.

After all, they still needed to get some sleep before their classes.

Chapter 51: Elevator
Azriel stifled a yawn as he stood in front of the mirror, checking his reflection.

"Seriously, why do I always have to get up so early in the morning?"

It seemed like no matter what world he was in, Azriel was destined to get out of bed at 6 a.m.—whether it was for high school or now, the academy.

Not being a morning person, Azriel was already starting to consider skipping the first day.

But he quickly shook his head.

'I can't just skip the first day. Besides, I'm a prince now…'

Dressed in the white academy uniform and black pants, Azriel nodded at his reflection before leaving his room.

Leaving his room, Azriel stepped into the elevator.

He wasn't in the mood to walk all the way down, no matter how beneficial some might claim it to be—especially not at this hour.

There was still 2 hours before classes would start, but knowing himself, it was better to leave as early as possible.

'The class I'm in is HCS-1, with Instructor Ranni as the homeroom teacher... the same class as the protagonist, huh.'

It would be a lie if Azriel said he was surprised that he and Lumine were in the same class.

He had almost expected it, as if it were fate.

'I wonder why he seemed so out of breath back in the cemetery, though...'

Azriel shook his head.

'It's probably better not to know.'

Lost in thought, Azriel was startled when the elevator suddenly stopped, causing him to furrow his brows.

The elevator wasn't exclusive to him, but he hadn't expected any of the first years to be up at this hour.

Most wouldn't even bother using the elevator, as their rooms were closer to the ground.

Unfortunately for Azriel, being the apex meant having the highest floor all to himself, which was both a privilege and a hassle.

'Maybe I should've just jumped from my room.'

Solomon was probably joking about breaking all his bones… probably.

Azriel sighed, closing his eyes and resigning himself to the situation, hoping the person entering wouldn't recognize him.

By now, most people would know he was the apex with just a quick search, but at least they didn't have a picture of his face—yet.

"Azriel…?"

His eyes flew open at the sound of the beautiful voice directed at him.

Standing before him was someone who made him profoundly grateful that he hadn't given in to his darker thoughts.

All his fatigue seemed to dissolve the moment he saw her.

Her long, flowing silver hair cascaded down her back, shimmering like moonlight.

Her grey eyes locked with his crimson gaze, their intensity both captivating and soothing.

She wore the pristine white academy uniform paired with a black skirt, and her pale, slender legs were elegantly encased in black stockings.

Azriel couldn't help but smile.

"Celestina. What a beautiful morning it is, isn't it?"

Celestina gazed at his face for a few seconds before averting her eyes and standing next to him.

"…I guess it is."

'I'm glad I didn't decide to skip today.'

Even though he had only slept for four hours, it was a different story leaving his comfortable bed.

"Congratulations on becoming the apex, Azriel."

"So it's already public knowledge, huh? Thanks."

Celestina looked at him with curiosity.

"Haven't you checked the rankings online?"

Azriel shook his head.

"I woke up half an hour ago and hurried to get ready so I wouldn't have to deal with others at this hour."

"So, you're not a morning person, huh?"

"What about you, Celestina? What's your rank?"

Azriel asked, although he already knew from the book that she was ranked second.

With Lumine now in second place, it likely meant Celestina was now ranked third.

"Third."

'Thought so.'

"Apparently, someone named Lumine Versille is ranked second."

Azriel nodded.

"I know. I met him yesterday."

"You did? What was he like?"

Azriel thought for a moment before responding.

"He's a good person, if I say so. Though his kindness might be taken advantage of by the wrong people."

"Is that so?"

Celestina nodded, considering the information.

It was likely she was assessing how to approach Lumine and form a connection with him.

'She's still a princess, after all…'

Perhaps she was also considering recruiting him for her faction.

Factions in the academy are akin to the four great clans in the real world.

The major factions currently in the academy are the Crimson Faction, led by Jasmine Crimson; the Nebula Faction, led by Caleus Nebula; and the Dusk Faction, led by someone Azriel didn't know the name of.

The Dusk Prince had graduated last year, passing his faction's leadership to someone else, but it remained one of the major factions.

Azriel knew that this year, Celestina would form her own faction, the Frost Faction, which would become a major player capable of competing with the others.

Of course, there were smaller factions, but most students preferred backing from one of the four great factions.

Normally, Azriel should have been interested in creating a faction, building connections, or even joining his sister's faction, but he wasn't keen on any of that.

Besides, he saw no need for it.

'What else are elder sisters for?'

Azriel was truly grateful that Jasmine was handling all of that already.

He certainly didn't need to ease her burdens—definitely not.

"Oh, by the way, he's a grade 3 intermediate like me." Azriel added.

Celestina's eyes widened.

"Are you serious?"

Celestina looked at him as though he were joking.

Azriel nodded his head.

"I am. He's an actual grade 3 intermediate."

Celestina fell silent, her gaze fixed ahead as they waited for the elevator to reach the lobby.

"…I see."

Her whisper barely reached his ears, and Azriel inwardly sighed.

'Can't blame her.'

If he remembered correctly, Celestina was currently a grade 2 Awakened, close to reaching grade 1.

The gap between her and Lumine, who was ranked second, was already significant, not to mention the gap between her and Azriel, who was ranked first.

Even in the book, she had been upset about not securing the top spot, but it must have been even more disheartening this time, being ranked third with such a large gap between her and the top two.

"Have I told you that the uniform looks beautiful on you?"

From the corner of his eye, Azriel saw Celestina flinch slightly.

"Is this your attempt at cheering me up?"

Azriel shook his head.

"No, I was just stating a fact."

The elevator fell silent again after his words.

"…Thanks. The uniform suits you as well."

Azriel turned his head toward Celestina.

"Is this your attempt at flirting with me?"

Celestina turned her head toward him, narrowing her eyes.

"Don't push your luck."

With that, she looked ahead again.

Azriel chuckled and did the same, not mentioning the small smile that had appeared on her face.

Chapter 52: Friends
"It looks like we miscalculated, haven't we?"

Hearing Azriel's words, Celestina could only nod in agreement.

They had both left early, thinking the academy grounds would be empty at this hour, but it wasn't.

Far from it.

It wasn't that the first-year students were still asleep—in fact, it was the opposite.

The academy grounds were bustling with activity, filled with students who seemed eager for the first day.

At least, they had been until Azriel and Celestina stepped out.

Apparently, the excitement for the first day was contagious.

'I wish I could relate.'

Azriel thought, shaking his head.

"Shall we go?"

Celestina nodded again, and both of them put on their signature smiles as they walked ahead, ignoring the eyes of the students watching them.

'Dammit, have these people never seen a prince and princess together? Wait, do they even know who I am...?'

Before he could delve further into his thoughts, Celestina interrupted with a question.

"By the way, Azriel, what class are you in?"

"HCS-1."

"I see, same as me. If it's fine with you, shall we go together?"

Azriel kept his smile as he nodded.

"It would be my pleasure."

Walking side by side, neither of them spoke.

Yet, it wasn't awkward.

It felt... comfortable.

As long as they ignored the whispers from the nearby students.

"Hey, that's Princess Celestina Frost, right?"

"Yeah... I saw she's ranked third."

"Wow, she's absolutely stunning!"

"Some no-name beat her for second place, apparently, but the apex this year is Azriel Crimson."

"That guy walking next to her... is he Azriel Crimson?"

"I don't know... but he's certainly handsome."

"If it is him, does that mean the rumors about him are true?"

The whispers continued, with students assuming Celestina and Azriel couldn't hear them.

But, of course, they could.

It's just that addressing them would only create more rumors.

'Wouldn't rumors start if they discover I'm Azriel, walking next to her?'

Azriel glanced at Celestina, who kept walking, eyes fixed ahead.

'I guess she doesn't care about such rumors...'

"Can I ask you a question?"

Celestina suddenly spoke again, halting Azriel's thoughts.

His smile grew slightly.

"Of course."

"...Back at the banquet, about our engagement... did you mean what you said?"

Azriel looked at her as they continued walking.

"I said a lot of things about our engagement. You'll have to be more specific, Princess Celestina."

Celestina turned to him, narrowing her eyes, the smile on her face disappearing.

"You know what I mean... about our last moment together when you..."

"When I told you that we should get engaged once we truly love each other, and then your face turned red in embarrassment, and you ran away?"

Azriel finished her sentence, a teasing smile playing on his lips.

Celestina looked ahead again, avoiding his gaze.

"I wasn't embarrassed, nor did I run away... You just caught me off guard, that's all."

Azriel nodded.

"What do you think?"

Celestina furrowed her brows.

"What do you mean?"

"Do you think I lied about what I said, or not?"

"That..."

Celestina hesitated, shaking her head.

"I don't know. I don't really know you well enough to say if you were messing with me or not."

Azriel hummed softly, his tone gentler.

"Then how about you find out for yourself?"

"What do you mean?"

"Take the time to truly know me and understand the kind of person I am. Only then will you discern whether my words were truth or lie."

This time, it was Celestina's turn to smile, a teasing glint in her eyes.

"Is this your attempt at befriending me, Azriel?"

Azriel chuckled.

"I was never the social type, so in a way... I guess it is."

"Oh..."

Celestina looked ahead.

"I guess we can be friends..."

"Then I'll be looking forward to our future together, Celestina."

"...Mm, me too."

*****

After a light chat, Azriel and Celestina walked together to their classroom. When they arrived, the room was already more than half full, just like the academy grounds outside.

The moment they stepped inside, the classroom fell silent.

All eyes turned toward them.

'Azriel is right—it's really too early for all of this.'

Celestina thought, resisting the urge to sigh.

Ignoring the stares and whispers, the two walked toward the seats on the left side, near the front. Azriel chose a seat by the window, and Celestina sat next to him.

They had taken their time and chosen a longer route to the classroom, chatting along the way.

As a result, class was about to start soon.

Celestina knew there probably wouldn't be any lessons today—just introductions and an overview of what to expect at the academy.

'I wonder what Azriel th—'

Celestina's thoughts came to an abrupt halt as she turned to where Azriel was supposed to be sitting.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Azriel was lying on his desk, head resting on his folded arms... asleep.

'You're kidding...'

She didn't dare look around at the other students, who were likely watching them closely.

Even if they hadn't yet figured out exactly who he was, they must have an idea based on his proximity to her.

But still...

'Doesn't he care?'

Celestina found herself unable to understand him.

His thoughts, expressions, and actions were unpredictable.

She had no clear idea of what kind of person he truly was.

'...to understand the type of person you are.'

Those words he had spoken earlier lingered in her mind.

It would be a lie to say she wasn't interested.

Besides, she genuinely wanted to be friends with him.

Celestina furrowed her brows slightly.

'Does he perhaps not get enough sleep?'

Thinking back to earlier, when she met him at the elevator, his eyes had been closed, and he had looked tired until she called out to him.

'...Does he maybe get nightmares from his time in the Void Realm?'

She was intensely curious about what had happened there, but she knew better than to ask.

They weren't close enough to discuss something so personal.

Deciding to let him sleep a little longer, Celestina began to feel bad if his fatigue was truly due to his time in the Void Realm.

"Woah! We made it in time!"

"Ugh! Didn't I tell you not to oversleep?!"

"Hehe, sorry!"

"Don't 'hehe' me!"

Suddenly, the quiet classroom was disrupted by a loud commotion at the door.

Like everyone else, Celestina turned to see two students standing there, talking to each other.

One was a boy with blonde hair and sky-blue eyes, while the other was a girl with black hair and green eyes.

Celestina furrowed her brows.

It wasn't that they were particularly loud—it was just that their voices echoed through the room, which had been silent due to her presence.

Noticing the odd atmosphere, both students quickly fell silent, their expressions turning pale as they realized they had drawn everyone's attention.

"S-sorry..."

The boy stammered, apologizing meekly, while the girl glared at him, clearly embarrassed.

They walked to the open seats in the middle of the classroom, near the front, right next to Celestina and Azriel, doing their best to ignore the curious stares from their classmates.

"Yo, Lumine, how have you been?"

Celestina turned her head toward Azriel, who was apparently awake again, though his eyes still looked a bit sleepy.

Startled, the embarrassed duo turned toward Azriel, with the boy looking relieved.

"Ah! Azriel, I've been good, thanks!"

Celestina studied the boy curiously.

'So, he's Lumine Versille, huh?'

The boy, who had apparently taken second place from her.

Celestina had never aimed for first place to begin with—at least not after the banquet.

Seeing Azriel's performance made it clear there was too little time to catch up and become the apex.

She was content with second place, but even that had been taken from her by the boy who seemed to be friendly with Azriel.

'I can see what Azriel meant about being taken advantage of.'

Lumine seemed genuinely kind—almost too kind.

Meanwhile, the girl next to him looked extremely surprised, her eyes shifting between Azriel and Lumine, though she still appeared guarded.

'So, she's probably the one protecting him from being used, huh?'
