"Is that so? As expected, right? Hahaha!"

"Yes, today I came here to talk about this rather than for training."

I spread the paper on the training ground floor so it would be easy to see.

Leo, who had been laughing as if relieved, checked the contents and then laughed for a different reason.

"...Doesn't it seem impossible by common sense?"

"By common sense, yes. But something irrational is happening. Let me explain."

Leo waved his hand at my words.

"Wait a minute, before you start talking. Do you know that if you walk around outside, rumors will spread for sure? The school knows you always keep your mouth shut, so there's not much talk. But outside, people will just find out you’re behaving like a normal person now. People outside don't run into you as often as your school friends do, so they won’t have time to notice you're still acting like a social outcast!"

"Is this worry or what?"

"It's concern, you bastard."

I never really acted like a social outcast...

I just didn't bother talking to anyone because improving my skills was urgent. From his perspective, I guess it looked like that.

Should I be pleased about this or not?

"...Yeah. Anyway, of course, I know. I wouldn't plan something like this without any precautions. Look, you know the cases of beast attacks have surged this year, right? So the Magic Security Bureau has started granting individuals the qualification of a cleaner."

"That's well known. But from what I hear, there aren't many applicants."

"Yeah, that's right."

Most mages are of noble status.

The stronger the magic, the higher the rank. Magic is hereditary, and ranks are already given to the previous generation.

So the hunting reward doesn't act as a good incentive for skilled mages.

Moreover, beasts can't invade the places where mages live, so they’re insensitive to the danger.

Taking on such odd jobs doesn't dramatically elevate their honor, so there's even less reason to do this work.

As a result, only non-mages, who aren't making much money, volunteer for this job.

And local offices composed of residents from the same area secretly let these people handle the beasts.

Although this fact is not widely known yet.

Then Leo, with a puzzled face, rustled through the papers and said.

"Since there are few people seeking the office, you'll stand out more. First, let me ask this. Are you going alone?"

"That's right. I brought it up to you because I wanted to ask about an artifact craftsman."

At those words, Leo thought for a while and then spoke.

"First, let's think about a practical problem. You can't operate under your own name. As a student, they will thoroughly verify your identity. Everyone in the capital knows your face, so how are you going to get past that?"

Yeah. It’s natural to think this way.

But once we get there, this utterly reasonable expectation will shatter.

"I've already investigated. Contrary to your expectation, they're not thorough at all. And in case of emergencies, I plan to change my identity, of course. I've thought it all through."

"...Sorry to say this for the third time, but you do know you're already famous in the Empire, right?"

"I know."

Leo looked at me as if he was seeing a complete lunatic.

"Changing your identity, sure. But even if you cover your face, how will you hide your eyes? Everyone in the Empire knows the color of your eyes."

At his words, I nodded.

Luca's pink irises are almost nonexistent in the Empire.

Or more precisely, they’re exclusive to Pleroma.

The color of magic is linked to the iris color, so it’s also close to pink. This, too, represents Pleroma.

All the family members have light brown or sky-blue irises, so Luca's iris color is exceptionally rare.

Even if I cover everything, people can identify me by the eyes and the color of the magic I use. Leo's reaction is quite understandable.

'Actually, since I have divine power, I’ve already solved the magic problem.'

I can simply use divine power instead of magic.

The problem is the eyes. Covering the face with a mask won't solve it.

But I already know a method used by the protagonist in the novel.

"Yes, there's a way. But you'll have to help."

"Me? Why?"

Leo asked, widening his eyes.

*

I swallowed the potion Leo had prepared.

Leo crossed his arms and squinted suspiciously.

"...Where did you learn about this? It has side effects, so even the elders in the family don't use it much."

I used the side effects to change the color of my eyes.

This potion changes the color of magic as a side effect.

Since it affects the core, it produces a power different from the original, so everyone avoids it.

I answered Leo's question nonchalantly.

"I studied. If you know anyone in the royal family, tell them to consider regulating it to prevent criminal misuse. Maybe around next year."

Since I preempted what the protagonist would do, mentioning it isn’t a bad idea.

Of course, only to the extent that it doesn't raise suspicion.

"...You're saying regulate it after you get all the use out of it, huh. Anyway, did you study abroad? It's hard to know this much within the Empire. Or did you study magical pharmacology?"

"Something like that. Thanks for preparing the potion."

He conveniently made up stories on his own.

Leo smiled at my attempt to change the subject.

"Thanks?"

"Yes."

I looked away from the potion and stared at Leo.

There's a reason he suddenly put on such an expression after being skeptical the whole time.

I gave him a look, urging him to speak up, and Leo got to the point.

"If you're grateful, do me a favor."

"What is it?"

"I'll handle the artifact commission. But let me go with you. Don't worry about the reward; you can take it all."

'What's this guy saying....'

I shrugged my shoulders.

"I don't mind, but why is this a favor? It's a waste of time."

"Don't worry about my time. I just can't trust your skills yet."

"I’ve been dealing with beasts for the past week, and it's not that hard. I'll start with the lower ranks for safety."

"For you, even mid-rank beasts wouldn't be difficult. But I'm afraid you'll burn everything around you."

I silently agreed.

Surely, someone of Leo's caliber wouldn't be pleased with my handling. Now that I've learned control, I won't completely scorch the area, though.

And having one more person isn't a bad thing.

"Fine, I don't mind."

So, the next day we headed to the office I had found.

Leo frowned and stepped aside.

"...Stay away. It sounded weird when you explained it, but seeing it in person is even stranger. You look like a thief...."

"Do you think I like going around like this?"

I adjusted my mask and grumbled at Leo's complaint. Unlike Leo, who was neatly dressed, I was wrapped head to toe in a black robe and hat.

Leo looked at me with a reluctant expression and sighed.

"At least your irises changed properly."

The originally pink irises now shone a deep blue in the darkness.

It's a common color, making it hard to identify anyone by it.

Leo cast a spell to prevent our voices from leaking out and spoke quietly.

"Remember, you're just a servant I hired personally. If someone asks why you’re dressed like that, I'll say you're a traveler from the Papal State. So keep your mouth shut. Got it?"

"Got it. What about titles? A low-ranking person can't just call you by your name in front of others."

"Hmm... don't use any unnecessary titles. Just keep it to a minimum."

After walking for a long time, we came upon a wooden building with damaged outer walls on the outskirts of the forest.

Leo furrowed his brow and illuminated the surroundings with his wand.

"Did we come to the wrong place? We should be in the right area."

"No, we're in the right place."

I remembered the protagonist harshly criticizing this as a 'completely dilapidated building.'

This building looked more like a ruin than any other I'd seen, so it had to be the one.

I knocked on the door naturally.

When there was no response for a while, Leo tilted his head.

"No reaction. Is no one here?"

"No, someone's here."

I knocked on the door with more force.

Then, a small window in the middle of the door opened irritably.

Two eyes, glaring as if annoyed, looked at me.

"What do you want?"

"We're here for the cleaning."

Bang―!

The sound of the window slamming shut made Leo flinch.

Experiencing such a brusque dismissal for the first time, Leo gaped in disbelief.

"What the...!"

"Wait a bit."

No need to be flustered. They did the same to the protagonist.

Then, the door swung wide open.

The fierce look from earlier had disappeared, replaced by a bright expression on the person's face.

The person held out a worn-out notebook.

"I didn't expect anyone to come for work at this hour. Please write your names here."

"I also brought an identity certificate. Do you need it?"

The person shrugged, looking surprised by my question.

"Do you have one? If you do, show it. But you know, if we ask for such things, no one would catch those creatures. We're just grateful if someone says they'll catch them."

Leo spoke with a sympathetic expression.

"I heard there's a severe shortage of people here. It seems to be true."

"It's not just a shortage, there's literally no one. The only people who knocked on this door all week were lost travelers. But...."

The manager looked us up and down and chuckled with a resigned expression.

"You have guts. Seems like you didn't even bring any weapons. You can use the ones here and return them tomorrow morning."

"Oh, we already have our own."

"Uh?"

The manager looked puzzled as Leo pulled out a wand from his waist and showed it.

"We're not planning to stay long, so we don't need swords."

"...A mage?"

The manager's eyes widened.

Leo answered with a puzzled look.

"Yes, we are mages. Only mages are qualified to deal with beasts...."

The manager, who seemed not to hear Leo's words, suddenly turned pale and bowed deeply.

"I'm sorry! A real mage has never come here before, so I...."

"No, it's fine. But... do non-mages come here?"

"......"

"Please tell me what's going on. I assure you, we understand the risk to your safety and won't mention it anywhere."

"Well, usually...."

Naturally, the manager couldn't continue speaking.

I leaned in and whispered to Leo.

"Do you really think they'll feel comfortable talking to a noble? Didn't you notice how their tone changed?"

"...I realized after I said it, so don't mock me."

Leo snickered and pushed me aside.

Unless the headquarters changes, there's no solving this issue. Reporting it anywhere would only cause trouble. We need to cut this conversation short.

I spoke up, seeing Leo was lost for words.

"I understand the situation. Let's leave it at that for now. We came here after reading an article about the increased frequency of beast appearances. We need permission to enter."

"Oh, yes. Are both of you mages?"

"Yes."

The manager hurriedly checked the notebook and looked at me with confused eyes.

They wouldn't turn us away now that we were here, but my all-black robed and masked appearance was suspicious to anyone.

"This person is...?"

"I am from the Papal State. Currently, I'm with...."

"My assistant. Hahaha! He said he wanted to travel the Empire!"

Leo hurriedly answered, pushing me back as if expecting what I would say.

"I see. It's an honor to have you both here. Are you planning to leave right now?"

"Yes."

"Then take this magic stone. There's a barrier, so you can't enter without it."

"Thank you."

After finishing our greetings, we left the building.

After walking for a while and entering the barrier, I snickered.

"Why did you answer so hastily? Did you think I'd say something?"

"I didn't expect you to answer properly...."

He muttered with a darkened face.

Though we hadn't even encountered a beast yet, he already seemed exhausted.

"Hold on."

I stopped walking as an unusual smell mixed with the gentle breeze.

I looked around.

"The smell of blood."

"Huh? I don't smell anything."

Without responding, I turned towards the scent.

Leo, sensing something, cast a thick barrier around us and followed.

The further we walked, the more we heard a creature frantically scratching something.

"...!"

Crunch— Crack—!

"Damn."

I stopped abruptly and looked down.

Rats, tainted with a purple hue, were gnawing at each other.

No, they were so deformed they could hardly be called rats anymore.

The mixture of pus and blood emitted an indescribable stench.

"...Shit...."

Leo, looking nauseous, covered his nose and stepped back.

"They could eat a person.... There are more than a few. Could there be a nest nearby?"

"Seems like it. And most of them look like they're about to go berserk."

"Yeah."

"They'll come at us soon."

"...Yeah, damn it...."

Leo closed his eyes tightly, let out a deep sigh, and swung his wand, transforming it into a sword of suitable length.

"Don't complain too much. If we start with these guys, it's a good welcome."

I smiled and drew my wand.

Noticing our presence, red dots gleamed all around us.

Ch 11: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family

Chapter 11

[Kieeek―!]

Bang―!

“They just fall over with one hit?”

After 30 minutes of dealing with the rats, it was surprisingly uneventful. At this point, the term "cleaning" felt almost embarrassing to use.

Leo carefully picked up the dead man-eating rats and put them into a sack.

Despite the rats climbing up his legs madly, they easily fell off with just a wave of his hand.

Now, cleaning up the corpses was more troublesome than dealing with the rats themselves.

I burned the top of the barrier to drop the rats onto the ground and answered simply.

“It’s because you’re strong.”

“Is that so... Have you filled your sack too?”

“Yeah.”

“Then let’s clean up and head back.”

Leo looked down at the rats caught on the tips of his boots.

The muddy ground from yesterday’s rain was littered with rat corpses the size of a hand.

Leo clicked his tongue as he watched.

“I know we have to deal with them, but there are so many of them. It’s a bit pitiful. It would be nice if there were a cure.”

I nodded at his words.

These kinds of monsters were ordinary animals that had acquired magic power and gained a core like humans. They constantly craved magic power.

The only treatment was to periodically infuse them with divine power. Even then, it wasn’t a fundamental solution.

‘It’s certainly pitiful when you think about it that way.’

Feeling such sentiments while facing a horde of rats trying to devour our flesh was a luxury. Normally, people are too busy surviving to have sympathy for man-eating rats.

Leo was this kind of person in the novel too.

Although I don’t remember the exact timing, he eventually developed a cure for monster-specific diseases.

I tied the full sack and floated it in the air as I spoke.

“Just make the cure. Why don’t you try making it later?”

“Me? No way, even the adults haven’t done it.”

“What?”

I couldn’t help but laugh at his disbelief.

Thinking back, the part I read was quite far from now.

Knowing what future Leo would create, I couldn’t help but smile.

I turned around and patted Leo’s shoulder as we headed back to the starting point.

“If you don’t do it, I will. Just lend me your family’s lab.”

“First, you need to survive.”

After some idle conversation, we arrived at a familiar location.

The manager, who happened to be outside, greeted us.

“You finished quickly.”

“We’ll drop this off and head back.”

I placed the sack full of rats in front of the building.

The manager approached the bulging sack with a curious look.

“Why is this so... hm?!”

The manager, who opened the sack, was speechless.

“Where did all these come from... I’ve never seen so many man-eating rats before.”

“Are there really that many?”

“Yes, with this many, you might have eradicated the entire population. Usually, even if we find a lot, it's just half a dozen.”

“They probably sensed our magic power and swarmed more than usual. They’re fundamentally starved for magic.”

The manager nodded at Leo’s explanation.

“I see. With this amount, they won’t show up for a while. It’s been a problem when they occasionally reached residential areas. This is fortunate.”

“Glad to be of help.”

“Judging by the weight, this should be worth at least 50,000 won.”

The manager said after lifting and placing down the sack.

I nodded at that. Working for an hour and earning roughly 500,000 won in value was something you couldn’t find anywhere else.

‘We practically eradicated them...’

Even Leo, who grew up in a wealthy family and lacked a sense of reality, seemed satisfied with the compensation for the time spent.

Leo, once again inside the barrier, shrugged as he spoke.

“I can earn a month’s allowance in an hour like this. This job isn’t so bad. Thanks to you, I had a good experience.”

“Sure. Just don’t assume you can always earn this much in an hour.”

“Of course, I know... I know.”

Leo rolled his eyes as he answered.

He didn’t seem to know. He was the epitome of a rich kid. Fortunately, he didn’t follow the protagonist to the royal palace for financial work later.

Leo, noticing I didn’t believe his words, quickly changed the topic.

“Anyway, we encountered some decent ones during our investigation.”

“Yeah.”

Although they were fast and large for rats, making them difficult for non-mages, we just had to cover our bodies with a barrier to prevent them from biting, making them easy to deal with.

“With this difficulty level and 50,000 won, we could earn enough for two of the items you wanted if we stayed here all night. And with me here, it’ll go even faster.”

“Right. But are you planning to stay here the whole time? I thought you’d suggest stopping after catching enough.”

“Since we’re here, we should do it properly. Not many volunteer for this, so I think it’s good to get it done thoroughly while we’re here.”

“Well, if you say so.”

At that moment, I stopped again.

Leo looked at me with a wary expression.

“What, you smell blood again?”

“Yeah.”

“You’ve got a good nose. I can’t smell anything.”

“This time, it’s cleaner. Not like the pus-mixed blood from before.”

“...You can tell that much? People might actually think you’re from Pleroma...”

Leo shook his head.

I brought my finger to my lips, signaling him to be quiet, and moved slowly.

With the talking stopped, only the sounds of small creatures rustling and the wind rustling the leaves remained.

Tadadak―

‘Hm?’

The moment I heard something unusual in the silence, an indistinguishable mass jumped out of the bushes.

Bang―!

I frowned, moved the barrier, and stepped back.

“That scared me.”

“What is it?!”

It seemed that the creature had simply crashed into us while running wildly, not intending to attack.

After confirming that no further attacks were coming, I flipped over the collapsed brown mass lying on the ground.

“It’s a rabbit. It's not contaminated.”

While I poured some water to wake the rabbit, Leo shouted from behind, seemingly dissatisfied with my defense.

“Hey, if you put that much distance, you should put all your strength into the barrier.”

“You told me to reduce the power before.”

“That was about the edges of the barrier. And this isn’t a sparring session. Don’t forget to connect your lower body to the ground to brace for recoil!”

“Even in this situation, you’re giving a lesson.”

Despite my words, I felt the same thing when casting the spell just now.

‘This is why practical practice outside of sparring is important.’

Balancing academic magic practice with lethal magic requires actual combat experience to be most effective.

Of course, you can't see the full effect in a place where small creatures like these usually appear, but if I can’t find real combat later, I’ll have to take down Pleroma.

‘But...’

This is ambiguous.

I watched the fleeing rabbit and fell into thought.

Can we really say there are no dangerous creatures here?

The rabbit had run without even checking what was ahead.

Moreover, I smelled another scent of blood earlier.

‘We should head back.’

The barrier we checked on the way here was a lower-level barrier. It indicated that there shouldn’t be dangerous monsters around.

Even if there were contaminated animals, they’d be like the rats and rabbits we encountered earlier.

There was no need to worry much if they weren’t monsters, but encountering carnivorous animals that eat humans at night was unnecessary.

I quietly spoke while examining the footprints on the muddy ground.

“Leo, prepare for defense. Let’s turn back and avoid this.”

“…I was going to say the same. Those are wolf tracks, right?”

We hadn’t heard of wolves living around here.

However, the footprints in front of us undeniably belonged to a large animal.

Leo adjusted his grip on his wand and strengthened his body barrier.

[Grrooooo....]

At that moment, an indescribable cry echoed faintly throughout the forest.

Whatever the creature was, it didn’t sound like a herbivore.

We’re already too late.

I slowly took a step back.

Suddenly, two red lights formed a line and extended towards us.

[Graaaw!]

Bang―!

“Ugh!”

I crouched to maintain my balance.

It was much stronger than the rabbit.

Fortunately, thanks to following Leo's advice earlier, the caster didn't get bounced back from the recoil.

Instead...

‘The barrier is cracked.’

Ordinary animals shouldn’t be able to break my barrier. Given the light I saw earlier, it’s highly likely that it’s a contaminated creature.

I rolled the wand in my hand and transformed it into a sword.

Creating a new barrier towards the sky, I shattered it, briefly illuminating our surroundings.

‘…!’

This is insane.

Leo and I both couldn’t hide our shock at the fleeting scene revealed before the light went out.

“…This is...”

It wasn’t just a wolf.

A solid horn had grown inside the wolf’s ears. It was an unimaginable combination that left our mouths agape.

‘This is crazy.’

The cracks in the barrier were probably thanks to that horn. But that wasn't the surprising part. That was still within the realm of understanding.

My gaze shifted to the wolf’s legs.

Unlike its long, thick grey-furred chest, its legs were short and covered in yellow fur.

It wasn’t just a matter of fur color. Anyone could see those legs belonged to another animal.

There was no more time to analyze the situation.

The wolf, reacting to our magic, started to rampage even more.

[Graaaaah!]

Bang! Bang!

I kept firing spells to distract the wolf’s vision.

Then, the plants around us thickened and lengthened, wrapping around the wolf.

It was the spell Leo had used on me before. The attempt to grab its legs failed, but it managed to snag its horn.

Because it had the legs of a herbivore instead of its own, the wolf easily lost its balance.

Taking advantage of the opening, I swung the wand. The tree behind the wolf snapped in the opposite direction and fell.

Bang!

The wolf's scream was drowned out by the crash.

I didn’t hold back at all, but for now, Leo didn’t say anything.

Leo, pale and wiping the blood splattered on his skin, averted his gaze from the corpse.

“…It’s a chimera.”

“Yeah.”

Connecting different animals haphazardly like that and making them move as one is generally impossible.

Only magic can make such an absurd thing possible, but even so, magic doesn’t naturally fuse different animals. It was clearly a human-made result.

“I felt this in the barrier earlier too, but according to the information you found, this isn’t supposed to be a dangerous area. Why is this...”

I nodded at Leo’s words.

There wasn’t any mention of this in the novel when the protagonist came here.

I considered the possibility of different beasts appearing due to the timing, but I didn’t expect such a suspicious monster to show up.

“The barrier here was originally low-level, indicating it wasn’t a dangerous area.”

After confirming that the creature was completely dead, I knelt and examined it closely.

“Leo, come over here. What do you think the main body of this creature is?”

“Haa...”

Leo sighed deeply, as if he couldn’t bear to look, and took a spot opposite me.

“…From the head to the chest, it’s a wolf. The horn and legs seem to be from a goat. So, the main body must be the wolf.”

“Yeah, I thought the same.”

“Why, who would do such a thing...”

Leo’s face twisted in disgust.

Shaking my head, I stood up.

“We can think about that later. Get up. This is just the beginning.”

“What?”

“No matter how much of a chimera it is, its habits should follow the main body. Do you remember the footprints we saw earlier?”

“…….”

Leo’s face hardened instantly as he understood my words.

The small carnivorous animal footprints flashed through his mind. But those were from another creature, not the wolf we just killed.

Leo muttered softly.

“…There’s no reason for a wolf to leave goat tracks.”

“Right, so they would live in packs, following the wolf’s habits.”

“How many are usually in a pack?”

“Well, if we’re lucky, it’ll be fewer than ten.”

I readjusted my grip on the wand.

The distinct wave of non-human magic touched my skin. It was getting closer.

[Grroooar….]

It was too late to call for reinforcements.

If we turn our backs now, they’ll chase us madly. These wolves, starved for magic, won’t leave a mage alone.

Even if we manage to shake them off, if they descend into the residential areas, many lives will be at risk.

‘Should I attempt it with the barrier?’

No, that won’t work. The barrier is just a secondary tool; it’s not perfect.

Considering that rats occasionally reached residential areas, it was clear the barrier couldn’t guarantee safety.

I spun the wand in my hand.

A red glowing spear formed.

“We need to deal with them all before dawn, right?”

Ch 12: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family

Chapter 12

Boom—!

It's been ten minutes since I faced off against the wolves. I once again drew a barrier through the air with my wand.

The massive body of the wolf crashed into the barrier.

I channeled my mana forcefully into the arm holding the wand to maintain my defensive stance. Once I found some stability, I scanned the pack of wolves.

‘The other ones aren't chimeras.’

Even though the forest was pitch black, with no moonlight penetrating, the constant barrage of magic provided enough visibility.

I wasn’t sure if it was because I was tense or because the early morning air was chilly, but my skin felt goosebumps. I bit my lip and continued to swing my wand.

‘Honestly…’

I never expected wolves to appear in this area known for lower-class magical beasts.

Especially not wolves that had been tampered with maliciously by someone.

In the novel, wolves were never mentioned to appear, and the protagonist had deliberately chosen a safe area just for simple exploration.

Even when I conducted my own investigation, numerous sources had already verified that this place was safe.

The plan had completely fallen apart, and now I was facing a life-threatening situation… A shift in perspective was necessary.

‘Maybe this is actually a good thing.’

Thinking positively, it wasn’t entirely a bad situation.

As soon as that thought crossed my mind, I shook my head.

‘I must be crazy.’

Honestly, I'm scared. No matter how I tried to shift my perspective, I couldn't be optimistic facing a situation where I could die.

But the situation had already unfolded. Therefore, I had to do my best to survive. I didn’t have to be overly positive, but I couldn’t let my life be handed over to regret.

I gripped the wand tightly with my sweaty hand.

Boom—! Crash—!

The wolves, tireless, continued to charge at the thick barrier. After several headbutts, they should have given up by now, but there was no sign of that.

I thrust my wand forward, sending one wolf flying far away.

Boom—!

[Awooooo....]

A pained howl echoed from the wolf.

The overpowering stench of blood that had been filling my head now mingled with a new, fresh metallic smell. The wolves went even more berserk at the scent of their kin’s blood.

I matched their frenzy with an increase in my attack speed. Then, something caught the corner of my eye.

“…!”

A flash of light to my right.

The red eyes of the wolf flickered and got closer to my face.

Boom—! Thud—

“Ugh!”

The recoil sent me sprawling to the ground.

In my haste to swing the wand, I didn’t have time to steady my legs.

The wolf, along with the fallen tree, seemed to have died as another strong scent of blood wafted to my nose.

“Lucas!”

Somewhere, Leo shouted.

In the process of driving away the wolves, we had gotten quite far apart, and his voice echoed heavily.

“Watch your own surroundings!”

I shouted back, veins bulging, as I swatted away a wolf leaping over my body.

That guy has the nerve to worry about someone else in this situation.

I pushed myself off the ground.

I knew I had given the wolves enough time since I had fallen.

Thus, my next choice would be crucial for my future.

As expected, the remaining two wolves charged at me with insane ferocity. I closed my eyes tightly and, without hesitation, grasped the wand with both hands and slammed it into the ground.

Boom—!

The bright white light from the wand illuminated the forest.

Leo, who was coming to assist me, covered his eyes. As I sensed his approach, I ran toward a distant wolf and shouted.

“Leo, take care of that one!”

Leo quickly lowered his arm and looked at the ground. One of the fallen wolves was staggering to its feet. It was clear it was too weak to walk properly.

“…….”

Leo took a step back as he watched the wolf drool and stagger towards him.

The wolf bit at the spot where Leo had been standing, then staggered again. When Leo shot magic at it, it collapsed sideways. Leo approached the dying wolf.

‘Considering the chimera creatures…’

These wolves must have also been created by someone.

If we left them alive, our lives would be in danger. Even if we somehow survived, there was a possibility they would descend into the village, so we had to kill all the wolves here. I don’t regret this decision.

But….

‘What if there was an antidote?’

There wouldn’t be a reason for them to suffer like this. The number of people harmed by magical beasts would significantly decrease. It would benefit everyone.

Leo placed his hand on the wolf’s chest.

As he channeled mana, the core’s outline became visible.

‘What was the poison Lucas drank? If it’s a poison that suppresses the core, it might be a temporary solution. Ultimately, the core itself needs to be removed, so... something must be added.’

Leo rubbed his chin.

Should I find ingredients to enhance that poison?

To have it act just before it infiltrates the heart, experiments would need to be conducted on each species.

After dismantling the core, the spread poison would need to be detoxified, so the time and medication costs must be calculated to administer the drug at the right moment.

‘There will be financial difficulties in supplying the second agent together.’

Leo, lost in thought, didn’t notice Lucas approaching.

“…….”

I laughed dryly.

Leo was engrossed in observing the dead wolf.

‘Is this really the situation I’m thinking of?’

I feel like I’m witnessing the creation of a pollution treatment being significantly accelerated.

I sat down next to him and asked.

“Are you going to make a cure?”

“Huh? How did you know?”

“It’s written all over your face.”

“Huh? Anyway, I’m going to give it a try. Just a try.”

“That’s great. You’ll succeed.”

“Hm….”

Leo, who had been frowning at the calculations, smiled broadly.

“Yeah, I'll make sure to succeed.”

Witnessing his growth firsthand after reading about it ten years in the future filled me with a unique sense of nostalgia.

In a place where nothing was familiar, it felt somewhat comforting to meet someone I already knew.

‘…It seems like I've accelerated things a bit, but oh well.’

A good thing is a good thing.

I stood up and asked, “Are you hurt anywhere?”

“Just a scratch on my forearm. How about you?”

“I'm fine.”

Unlike Leo, I had to be careful about my identity, so I couldn’t afford to leave any distinguishing injuries. Fortunately, I didn’t sustain any major wounds.

I picked up the sack we had brought and nodded towards the wolves.

“Let’s clean up and head back.”

*

“You’re back. I was worried you wouldn’t make it since it’s almost morning….”

The manager greeted us but stopped in his tracks.

The sack we brought, floating half in the air, was even bigger than before.

‘How many did they hunt?’

While this area had its share of magical beasts, it wasn't known to be particularly dangerous. It was astonishing to think about how far they must have gone to catch this many.

The manager, who was overwhelmed with shock and admiration, finally noticed the state of our clothes. Though dark and not immediately obvious, they were stained with blood and mud.

“Are you alright?!”

“We’re fine. We’d appreciate it if you could handle this first.”

Leo set the sack down on the ground. The manager opened it and loosened the string.

“Let’s see… Huh?”

The manager turned pale and froze.

‘I knew he’d react like that.’

I quickly added an explanation before he could panic further.

“These are wolves. You’ll probably need to contact the security department.”

“Th-there shouldn’t be wolves here….”

These wolves were at least mid-level magical beasts.

Even without knowing much, he could tell that. Wolves of this caliber should not be in an area designated as a low-risk zone.

Of course, I had never seen wolves in this area during my entire life here.

“Oh, and there’s one chimera wolf among them.”

“What?!”

“It appears someone intentionally cast a spell to combine a wolf with another creature. There might be a gag order on this information. Be careful not to speak carelessly to the media.”

It wasn’t common for wizards to get involved in such places, so there was a high chance that journalists might come to investigate.

Ideally, it would be best if no one knew, but since we had to transfer money from the bank connected to this place, word might get out.

The manager, looking as though he had inadvertently stepped into something shady, nodded vigorously.

“Yes, of course.”

As the manager panicked, silence fell, and I got straight to the point.

“So, when can we receive our payment? The cash stored here won’t cover it.”

To avoid theft, they only kept small amounts of cash here.

Until now, all those who had received payments were non-mages, so the amounts had never been significant.

“Ah, that….”

The manager stood up and opened a drawer in his desk.

A communication device bearing the logo of the Imperial Central Bank appeared.

*

Though it seemed unused for a long time and was covered in cobwebs, the communication device was functional.

Less than ten minutes after contacting the bank, a new transaction appeared in Leo’s account.

“N-ninety-five thousand….”

As we returned to the place where we had first warped, Leo murmured, his face pale.

I agreed with his reaction. It was an insane amount, equivalent to a hundred million won.

‘Crazy.’

Even though we risked our lives, it was still an absurd amount for half a day's work.

Leo, despite his lack of worldly knowledge, seemed to understand that it was rare to earn nearly a hundred million in such a short time.

Silently appreciating Leo’s realistic sense, I spoke.

“They set the price at ten thousand pel per wolf.”

A million won per wolf.

It seemed like a hastily set price, not expecting anyone to actually catch the wolves, or perhaps it was meant to compensate highly skilled personnel capable of handling such a situation. Regardless, the payment felt surreal.

Of course, attaching a risk premium made the price somewhat reasonable.

Corrupted creatures could exert tens or hundreds of times their usual power, meaning only someone prepared to face death could tackle them.

“…It was an unexpected problem, but it wasn’t entirely unmanageable. I'm glad we resolved it without any major injuries.”

Leo took out his enchanted account book and looked at the recently updated figures.

“When we get back, I’ll immediately place an order for the upgraded items we chose earlier. We can afford even better ones now.”

“Thanks. Oh, but keep half of it for yourself. It wouldn’t feel right to take it all alone.”

Initially, when I thought we were dealing with minor magical beasts, I didn’t mind Leo saying he’d let me have everything. But after inadvertently putting him through a life-or-death experience, I felt reluctant to take the entire amount.

Contrary to my hesitation, Leo tilted his head, puzzled.

“Um… I don’t really need it.”

“…….”

What’s with that ‘really’? He probably said it without much thought, but for someone whose balance was virtually zero, it only made me laugh dryly.

Hearing the deflated sound from beside him, Leo began to explain belatedly.

“Ahem… I don’t mean it like that. It’d be good to invest it all to stabilize the core as soon as possible. Besides, I insisted on coming along from the start. I told you I’d give you everything. And I don’t have anything to buy….”

“Enough with the explanations.”

“Okay.”

Leo found a suitable spot and cast a teleportation spell.

In an instant, the space transformed into Leo’s training ground.

Leo scanned the open ceiling of the training ground and tapped the door.

“Alright, let’s head to the dorms. Let’s rest tonight and meet again tomorrow evening.”

“Yeah, good work today. Get some rest.”

Leo waved at my greeting.

I reached for my pendant, then paused and spoke quietly.

“Leo.”

“Hm?”

“Thanks for today.”

If he hadn’t been there, facing the wolves alone would have been difficult. In many ways, I felt fortunate. Having such a good companion from the start was lucky.

Leo, surprised by my words, shrugged his shoulders with a smile.

“That’s my line.”

*

‘What do you mean that’s your line?’

Typical of a magic fanatic.

Essentially, he seemed fine facing a pack of wolves because he could observe magic.

His passion was no ordinary passion. I could understand why the protagonist kept him around for ten years.

Lost in various thoughts, I gathered my books and left the room.

Before I even reached the floor, I heard a familiar conversation.

“Hey, did you hear? Someone swept up ninety-five thousand pel in the northeast forest today.”

Ch 13: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family

Chapter 13

I stopped walking when I heard voices coming from behind the stairs.

As expected, rumors had spread.

It was inevitable, considering it wasn’t common for such a large sum of money to be spent in a single day.

"Did you hear? It was Leo and his attendant. Both of them are mages, which is probably why they spent so much."

"Leo?! Why did he go there all of a sudden?"

"Leo said his attendant wanted to visit the place. Apparently, they came from the Papal States."

"Really? Did you hear their name? If they're a mage, they must be a noble too."

"I don’t know. I can’t remember the foreign surname. But according to the manager, it doesn’t seem to be a noble surname."

"Could a mage traveling with Leo really not be a noble? It must be a fake name."

"Probably. They even wore a mask."

"Really?"

I stroked my chin.

Using a noble surname would have left traces, so I wrote my original surname instead.

Since the news would soon spread to the Papal States, there was no need to use a real noble surname and risk causing trouble between families.

‘In reality, foreign mages entering the capital and engaging in various activities would typically need to be verified at least once.’

However, there wasn’t a proper system in place, and in the novel, the law was only revised after the protagonist threw a bomb-like incident at the imperial family around the middle of the story.

Until then, they just leisurely assumed that ‘if such a prestigious family gave permission, their identity must be verified.’

‘Of course, Leo’s family would be hearing this for the first time...’

Because they never gave permission.

But since Leo would handle that, there was no need for me to worry.

For now, everything was within the expected range. That was enough.

I left the spot, leaving the students' ongoing conversation behind.

By noon, the situation was the same.

The news quickly spread throughout the school and the entire capital.

“Did you hear?! That blue-eyed hunter is going there again tomorrow?!”

“Ugh…”

While moving to the lecture hall, I choked at the shout I heard somewhere.

‘...That title just now…’

Were they talking about me? More importantly, who said they were going tomorrow?

Once I started paying attention, I realized I could hear similar things from several places around me.

‘...Status window.’

I opened it just in case, and the title had indeed changed. It seemed to vary depending on how I was referred to here.

‘Judging by that title, this will continue for a while.’

Moreover, the Chimera Wolf incident hadn’t even been reported yet. If the authorities decided to report it, the current fervor would last even longer.

I thought while glancing at the students carrying newspapers.

*

It turned out that the title wasn’t something the students came up with on their own; it was first used by the newspaper that reported the incident. Other newspapers also used the same title, so it seemed to have already stuck.

In fact, Leo’s situation was more severe than mine.

I just had to endure an incomprehensible name, but Leo had to deal with countless students' questions and attention directly.

As expected, his expression darkened every time we met on the street. The usually cheerful guy had turned grim, which said it all.

The next evening, Leo was sitting on the training ground floor without saying a word for a long time.

I looked down at Leo and asked,

“Are you okay?”

“No.”

Leo answered with a face that looked ten years older.

We had gathered at the training ground, but seeing that, it didn’t seem like he was in any condition to train today.

‘He must have been bombarded with questions all day.’

In this sense, it was quite beneficial to conceal one’s identity. I interpreted it positively and sat down next to him.

Leo spoke weakly.

“Did you know? Our story was in five different newspapers today. Why are they so obsessed? I even received three interview requests yesterday.”

“You’ve been through a lot.”

I had expected the attention to die down a bit, but it only grew stronger.

‘It must be due to the air of mystery.’

If it had just been Leo and his revealed attendant hunting monsters together, it would have ended as a simple good story about Leo. But because of the mysterious elements surrounding me, people were even more frantically spreading stories.

Moreover, investigations revealed that the wolf wasn’t a type found in the Empire, and the imperial family announced that the culprit was likely from Pleroma.

With two mages conveniently appearing and stopping a crime involving a cult, it was bound to become a hot topic.

‘It’s a relief we didn’t get caught.’

Why did they have to mention Pleroma?

Even though I wasn’t from Pleroma, I was already being associated with such an image, so if I were discovered, it would truly be the end.

Considering the worst-case scenario, the current situation was quite good.

“Oh.”

Leo noticed a package beside him and handed it to me.

“I almost forgot to give you this. It arrived today.”

“It came earlier than expected.”

“I asked them to make it as quickly as possible. It doesn’t take long to make anyway.”

Even so, I didn’t expect it to be delivered in just one day.

I accepted the box Leo handed over.

“Thanks.”

“No problem. Just make sure to use magic well.”

“What…”

“Huh?”

“Never mind.”

‘Stay healthy’ would have made more sense, but what did he mean by ‘use magic well’?

As always, he was obsessed with magic.

I ignored Leo’s comment and unwrapped the package.

“Wow…”

Leo began to admire the inner packaging and then, seeing the item, he started to marvel in a slightly different tone.

“Wow, it’s really plain.”

Inside were a plain wristwatch and a silver necklace chain.

The best effects come from embedding the artifact under the skin, using small chips or earrings.

I didn’t try the former due to the psychological discomfort, and while the latter was better, a mage with pierced ears clearly indicated the use of an artifact. It could be dangerous if I encountered my brother.

However, a wristwatch and necklace were close enough to the body to be effective. I had also consecrated the artifacts with my blood and magic to enhance their effectiveness.

The watch was meant to conceal the magic circulating through my body, and the necklace chain was to stabilize my core. The current pendant I was using was an artifact, so changing the chain wouldn’t be an issue.

I had spent a fortune to thoroughly block any magical leakage, making them look like ordinary accessories, and I still had about ten million won left.

‘I’m not going out again.’

While a thousand could quickly be spent and disappear for a mage, there was no way I was going to hunt monsters again. I smiled contentedly.

“Try it on quickly. I’m curious.”

“Sure.”

At Leo’s urging, I roughly fastened the watch around my wrist.

“…!”

Perhaps because it contained my blood and magic, I felt an indescribable sensation on my wrist, even though it wasn’t embedded under my skin.

“…It feels like something is pulling, but I don’t feel anything else.”

“No, try using magic.”

Leo excitedly pointed to the other end of the training ground, waving his arm. I drew my wand and fired a spell at the spot Leo indicated.

Boom―!

“Oh.”

It felt different, like a path had been made. If I had been driving on an unpaved road until now, it felt like I was on a somewhat poorly paved road now.

“You felt it too, right? And the magic aura around you before and after casting the spell has significantly decreased. It’s much cleaner.”

“Really? I used the same amount of magic power as usual, though.”

“That’s right. This only suppresses the scattered magic after casting.”

“Nice.”

I pulled up the status window again.

‘Huh?’

My skill had increased by 3 points?

Leo's remark about the clarity was undeniably true. Seeing a significant numerical increase, instead of minor decimal rises, was astonishing.

I shoved my wand back into my belt and touched the necklace chain. Though I couldn't feel any immediate effect... it might be different when I actually use it.

I swapped the necklace chain and tucked the pendant inside my shirt.

Leo waved his wand slightly to sense the surrounding magic and tilted his head.

“Maybe it’s because of the watch effect, but I don’t feel anything immediate from this one.”

“...Really?”

But for me, it was different.

I couldn’t close my mouth, pressing down on my chest.

Unlike before, my core had become so light that I couldn’t even perceive its presence.

‘My health also went up by 3 points.’

I conjured flames in my hand.

The tiny cracks and shocks I used to feel every time I used magic were gone. No, it was like I hadn’t known they were cracks and shocks in the first place.

But…

‘So this is what it’s supposed to feel like.’

This must be how a normal core operates.

To be precise, this was how a -0.5 core felt.

Being a 21st-century human without a core and with Luca’s core long damaged, I had no idea what a healthy core felt like.

But now I knew for sure.

Breathing and magic control were much freer than before.

I took the pendant out from my shirt and off my skin.

As the artifact moved away from my core, my chest felt heavy and blocked again.

I hadn’t noticed before, but now that I knew what a healthy core felt like, I couldn’t just leave it like this.

“It’ll be even better once my core is fully healed.”

“Something’s different, huh? Glad I picked the right ones.”

If I made an enhancer, I could feel this without the artifact.

And if I made a cure, I could live with a permanently healthy core, even after the enhancer's effects wore off.

Waiting for the drug to be developed was reckless.

Leaving a normal core unattended, I almost learned magic with a severely damaged one.

I sent Leo back to the dorm, considering his poor condition, and practiced magic alone.

I checked the time when I started feeling tired. It was midnight when I entered the training ground, and it was now close to 3 a.m.

Magic does take a lot of stamina, but three hours felt a bit short. This seemed to be the limit with -0.5 health.

‘Still, I should rest for tomorrow.’

I moved to the dormitory, tossed my bag on the desk, and plopped into a chair.

“Huh?”

Something odd caught my eye.

Thud—

When I opened the door, a note fell to the floor.

I unfolded the roughly folded yellow paper to reveal hastily scrawled letters.

[I know everything.]

A chill ran down my spine.

I stared at the note with cold eyes.

[Come outside the dorm right now.]

I glared at the note for a moment, then relaxed and burst into laughter.

I didn’t know what they thought they knew, but...

If they had my weakness, they would have gone to the media and revealed my identity without confronting me.

‘Monster hunting is the most likely thing they know about.’

Let's assume they called me out because of that.

In that case, they likely didn’t have any concrete evidence and were relying on suspicion.

In this situation, they’d press me, claiming I came out because I felt guilty, proving I was the hunter.

If it came to that... I could just play dumb.

Anyone else might struggle, but Luca could pull it off.

He was the type to follow orders out of fear, not knowing what might happen.

‘Though that was the story of the past year...’

Anyway, with no evidence, I could just mumble that I came out because I didn’t know what was going on, and they wouldn’t be able to confirm anything.

‘Any problems that arise can be dealt with.’

So I should obviously go. Telling a teacher wouldn’t solve this issue.

I hadn’t expected this to come so soon, but if someone suspicious was coming to me, I welcomed it.

I slipped the note back into the door and headed for the stairs.

As I opened the dorm entrance, a hesitant student approached.

“Uh... excuse me...”

From the way he spoke, he didn’t seem to be the one who sent the note.

I stared at him silently, and he looked at me with frightened eyes.

“Why.”

“You saw the note, right? The senior students from the magic department told me to bring you.”

“Who exactly?”

“I don’t really know…”

They must have just grabbed someone off the street.

Usually, you’d refuse a request like this from a stranger, but he came... maybe they threatened him.

I waved my hand forward silently, and the student quickly moved.

Even after a long time, we didn’t seem to be arriving anywhere. I spoke to the student’s back.

“Going pretty far, aren’t we?”

“Huh?! Oh, yeah... I didn’t realize it either. But we’re almost there.”

The main buildings of the school had already shrunk into the distance.

Abandoned buildings and the outskirts of the school started to appear.

“Did those seniors say anything specific about me?”

“Oh, no. They just said you’d come out soon, so I should bring you.”

“Got it.”

At that moment, I saw four or five people moving in the distance.

They couldn’t enter the abandoned building, so they were waiting in the central space.

Seeing them, the student hurriedly turned back before reaching the people and left.

I approached them.

“What the… He really came.”

“Hey, hand over the fifty thousand pell.”

“This guy is crazy. Anyway, I wrote the note as you said.”

The students laughed amongst themselves.

As I silently watched them, one of them stepped forward.

“Hey.”

After staring at me for a while, he stuck his chin out.

“Why are you here? Got something to confess?”

“You called me out.”

My indifferent answer made a few of the people behind him burst out laughing.

“What’s he saying...”

“See? I told you he’d come out if we just wrote ‘come out’ without any other details. He hasn’t changed a bit.”

“Right.”

“So hand over the fifty thousand.”

“Fuck, no way. Shut up. You’re ruining the atmosphere.”

They laughed to themselves and then suddenly stared at me in silence.

‘They were in my class, weren’t they?’

Faces I often saw around.

They were far from top students like Leo.

They knew magic, which got them into this school, but they had no outstanding qualities in academics or personality, and they saw all relationships as a hierarchy.

They’d do anything to get in the good graces of top students like Leo but tried to keep people like Luca, who everyone avoided, underfoot.

‘They don’t seem particularly afraid of Pleroma…’

They must have looked down on me, knowing my personality.

‘It’s unfortunate that I’m in the same class as these guys.’

Luca had terrible memories of them.

In the first year, Luca was once rumored to have eaten a live rat, a rumor these students had spread.

They probably wanted to see how far they could push Luca before he reacted.

The guy in front stepped closer, lowering his voice.

“It’s nothing serious. You just seemed a bit weird.”

“……”

“Anything happen recently?”

Another student, who had been laughing in the back, got up and put his arm around my shoulder, asking.

“What happened that you’re staring at us with those eyes? You usually don’t.”

“Haha! His eyes look so alive. Fuck, I’m too scared to look.”

I let out a short laugh at his words.

Yeah, it wouldn’t be right if there weren’t at least one of these types. I knew I’d meet them sooner or later.

The reason for my tension disappeared in an instant. They had no clue about what I was concerned about.

They just called me out to mess with me.

The phrase ‘I know everything’ was just to scare me into coming out.

‘They didn’t use direct threats like ‘come out or die’ to leave themselves a way out if questioned.’

They used just enough words and sentences to claim they weren’t threatening.

I hadn’t expected to have to play along with the school’s hierarchy games...

‘But it’s a good thing.’

Since it wasn’t a serious issue.

I sighed, looking at the increasingly aggressive students.

“Just tell me why you called me out.”

“This bastard just sighed. Hey.”

“Hey, we should tell him. We don’t like seeing punks like you acting all proper. Got it?”

“What kind of punks?”

“You don’t know? You asking because you don’t know? Trying to act smart while changing your image?”

He laughed, brushing his hair.

“Damn, you talk too much. Last year, you looked like shit, so why suddenly act normal?”

“No, stop talking. He won’t understand.”

“I think so. Hey, did you get it? If not, we’ll show you ourselves.”

They started laughing again.

A student sitting on the ground wiggled his fingers.

“Hand it over.”

“What, you bastard.”

“Haha… Oh, he’s cursing now. I’m so shocked I can’t even speak.”

The guy got up and pointed at my jacket.

“Hand over your jacket

Ch 14: How to Survive as the Second Son of a Mage Family

Chapter 14

By letting this happen, I was essentially notifying my family that my position at school was still poor.

Since the school uniforms were custom-made by the family, any damage to the uniform would inevitably be reported back home.

If it were Luca, he wouldn’t explain why the clothes were damaged. Naturally, I wouldn’t either. There’s no need to unnecessarily involve the family.

‘...Of course, if they have any sense, they’ll figure out why my clothes are damaged.’

Even so, there’s no need to worry about the family’s honor.

It’s a misconception to think that the family would go berserk at the notion of someone harassing a member of the Ascanien family.

I’m not practically part of the family, and everyone knows that.

‘The family’s reputation has only improved thanks to ‘consistently caring for a demon-possessed child – although there’s no progress – providing food, clothing, and a good education.’’

In other words, the entire empire considers Luca and Ascanien separately.

Even those who fiercely bite and criticize Luca would bow their heads if they met a ‘real’ Ascanien.

Therefore, there’s no need to worry about the family stepping in; I only need to consider whether my brother will hear about this.

If he finds out, my brother...

‘He’ll be grinning ear to ear.’

Should I make him happy for a while?

I threw off my jacket.

“Wow, you threw it on the ground for us to step on?”

Thud—!

Someone stomped hard on the jacket. Dust flew up from the boisterous kicks.

“Hahaha!”

“Hey, make sure you do it properly.”

Other students laughed and cheered.

‘...Sigh...’

I felt a strange sense of unease. Watching them genuinely rejoice in kicking someone else’s clothes made me question where I was.

More importantly... the certainty that the family wouldn’t intervene unless this incident spread widely was something only Luca, who grew up in that house, could have.

While people might look down on Luca, separating him from Ascanien, physical trouble is a different matter altogether.

The reason Luca hasn’t been openly harassed is that as long as he bears the family name, the family can apply ‘nominal’ punishment or pressure.

‘In other words, these guys...’

They can’t see even one step ahead.

It’s surprising that these thoughtless idiots haven’t hit Luca before now.

“No, but look at this guy. He’s not even reacting.”

Feeling confident from the cheers, one of them stepped up and grabbed me by the collar.

“Isn’t it enough that you did what we asked? Now you expect a reaction too?”

“...What...”

For a moment, the guy holding my collar looked confused.

No matter how he looked, this wasn’t the Luca they knew.

Last year, if I had been called out here, I would have been so pale and terrified that I seemed ready to pass out.

‘...I thought he was just pretending to be tough.’

Can someone keep up the act even in this situation?

Once someone grabbed my collar, I expected him to drop the facade and reveal his cowardly nature.

The guy’s grip tightened around my shirt.
