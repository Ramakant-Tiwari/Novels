Each of them knew parts of his mission, but not all of it—not even Freya.

He sighed, glancing around at their curious faces, then chuckled helplessly.

"If you really want to know, I guess I should start from the very beginning."

Chapter 114: Aftermath [2]

It all started a few weeks after the White Haven incident with Azriel and Nol.

Azriel was supposed to rest—his parents and sister were worried, and he wasn't allowed to train.

But instead of complaining, he obliged.

He didn't want to make them anxious.

But did that mean he was going to sit idle?

Of course not!

His plan had always been to change the future, and he had already begun putting everything in motion.

Knowing that Nol still possessed Dante's blood, he made Nol invite Dante to another meeting, convincing him to fully join their side.

Though Azriel wasn't privy to the details of what Nol said, the task was completed flawlessly, and Dante offered more of his blood afterward.

Next came the Christmas banquet.

Azriel's grand entrance and his duel with Caleus—at first glance, Freya assumed it was all to impress her, to get her to follow Azriel's wishes.

But that wasn't the plan at all. Azriel was fooling her, and she eventually realized it.

He made her believe they were being monitored by Neo Genesis operatives during the banquet.

The decoy plans he planted were intentional.

When Freya found out, she still had one burning question:

How could anyone have been listening?

After all, she had placed a sound barrier around them. No one should have been able to hear their conversation.

But…

The truth was, Azriel didn't know if there were actual Neo Genesis spies present.

It didn't matter.

He was the spy—or rather, Solomon was.

Solomon had been carrying a recording device the entire time, capturing their conversation.

Eventually, Solomon passed the recording to Azriel, who handed it to Nol.

Nol then gave it to Dante.

Dante's mission was simple: leak the plan, along with Azriel's existence, to one of the Heptarchs.

A difficult mission, given that the Heptarchs usually resided in the Void Realm.

But Dante had learned of Zoran's return beforehand.

That's why he went to a Neo Genesis's base in Antarctica, where Zoran's anchor was located.

All Dante had to do was wait for his terrifying mission to begin.

And it did.

His luck paid off—Zoran came.

After that, everyone knew what happened.

Dante sacrificed himself. He was a hero.

For Azriel and Nol, at least.

Zoran, upon learning of Azriel's existence and how his book had been rendered useless, became agitated.

Instead of thinking things through, he panicked and came directly for Azriel.

He wanted Azriel dead.

In his eyes, Azriel was a dangerous threat.

But...

He didn't realize that Azriel had anticipated this and was waiting for him.

Freya remained oblivious until she arrived and saw Grandmaster Thomas.

At first, she must have thought Solomon would handle the surface, but Azriel had other plans.

He explained everything, leaving out certain parts he couldn't disclose.

The others were left stunned.

Jasmine was the first to break the silence.

"So you had someone infiltrate Neo Genesis… and draw Zoran to you? Dante, was it?"

Azriel pressed his lips together before nodding.

"He's a hero. Because of his actions, someone as dangerous as Zoran has been dealt with."

Celestina spoke next, her relief evident, though few knew of Zoran's existence.

If it were common knowledge, his bounty would be staggering.

Azriel nodded.

"Indeed. Sir Dante was a hero, sacrificing himself for the greater good."

Celestina furrowed her brows.

"And Uncle Thomas?"

Azriel sighed, glancing at Thomas, who gave a nod. Shrugging, Azriel replied lightly,

"It wasn't difficult to contact Grandmaster Thomas—after all, I have his number."

He was a prince, after all.

How could he not have the contact information of the Frost King's right hand, especially when their clans were on good terms?

Reaching out to Thomas, Azriel shared parts of the plan, warning him of the impending attack and advising him not to trust anyone.

He also hinted that Celestina might be in danger and that it would be best not to inform Ragnar.

Azriel hadn't been sure if Thomas would listen.

But fortunately, he did.

Though, Azriel had another purpose for Thomas being here.

Celestina slowly began to piece everything together.

Azriel felt strange under the weight of their stares.

They were...

Shocked.

From their perspective, Azriel had been planning this for months, managing to outwit people who could kill him in an instant.

Jasmine looked at him with a worried expression.

She undoubtedly had much to say, but held back, knowing they were not alone.

Unfortunately, before any more questions could be asked, the healer finally arrived.

Celestina and Thomas left, heading to another tent, while Jasmine stayed behind.

Azriel and Thomas exchanged a glance. Azriel gave a nod, and Thomas returned the gesture before departing.

Azriel shifted his gaze toward Jasmine, but before he could speak, she cut him off.

"I'm staying, no matter what."

Azriel blinked, then offered a faint smile.

The female healer sat down on the chair in front of him.

"My prince, if you could please hand me your... hand."

Azriel nodded, tapping his storage ring, and his right hand materialized.

Jasmine paled, clenching her trembling fists, but she didn't look away. -exclusive

The process of reattaching his hand was as straightforward as it could be, given the healer's affinity for healing.

Still, it took a significant amount of her mana.

After 30 exhausting minutes, the procedure was finished, and the healer quietly left.

When she did…

Azriel's consciousness finally slipped away.

*****

Most of the streets were filled with frightened humans, some even injured.

Undoubtedly, Thomas had saved many lives as he looked at them.

But not all.

He had left the rest to the military and heroes before rushing off to confront Zoran, failing miserably.

...Casualties had occurred.

As he walked forward, he suddenly turned to his right, entering one of the narrow passages between the buildings.

Here, a deserted street lay before him.

It was nighttime, and as he continued forward, he eventually came to a halt.

A pair of eyes met his, shining in the darkness.

Standing in front of a ladder that led to the top of a building was a silver-haired boy wearing a simple black T-shirt and pants.

His crimson eyes shifted to Thomas, and he offered a smile before bowing.

"It's an honor to meet you, Grandmaster Thomas. My name is Nol."

Chapter 115: Aftermath [3]

Thomas silently observed the silver-haired boy before him.

He had received a message while in his private tent, a text from an unknown number instructing him to meet here, under Azriel's orders.

Normally, he would have been skeptical, but the nod from Azriel made him comply.

'Cadet Nol... A silver-haired boy was reported staying in the Crimson Mansion these past few months...'

As the right hand of the Frost King, it was his duty to gather as much information as possible, whether it came from allies or enemies.

But here was the problem—he didn't get much about this boy.

Nol hadn't stood out in the rankings for the first year, and yet...

'Intermediate rank...'

Thomas mused, though he knew it was a facade.

This boy wasn't ordinary.

He was strong, too strong for his age.

Nol stood there silently, a smile playing on his lips, as Thomas asked.

"Who exactly are you?"

Nol blinked before chuckling softly.

"Me? I'm like you, Grandmaster Thomas. The true sword of my master."

Master?

"Are you referring to Prince Azriel?"

Nol nodded, his smile brightening.

"Exactly! Just as you are the right hand of the Frost King, I am the right hand of my master. I'm here on his orders, as your presence may be needed if... well, things get complicated."

Thomas inwardly felt perplexed.

A boy this young, serving the prince?

While master-servant relationships weren't unheard of, there were still laws preventing those under eighteen from being forced into such roles.

Which meant... Nol was serving Prince Azriel willingly.

'What about his parents?'

Thomas wondered but held the question back.

The fact that Nol had been living in the Crimson Mansion likely meant his relationship with his family was... complicated, if it existed at all.

In truth, it didn't.

Nol had no memory of his parents, nor did he know anyone before Azriel.

His earliest recollections were of White Haven, and the first person he had ever met was the prince.

Thomas sighed, softening his tone.

"Prince Azriel must trust you a great deal to send you here. If I may ask, why?"

Nol nodded.

"Of course, he trusts me. I know him better than anyone. As for why you're here..."

Nol tapped his storage ring, and a small device appeared in his hand.

"It's because of this—a void artifact."

Thomas's eyes widened.

'A void artifact? Such a modern-looking device?'

It resembled something as ordinary as a tablet, yet this was anything but ordinary.

Void artifacts were rare, and this one... felt even more unusual.

As if sensing his thoughts, Nol continued.

"This isn't a normal void artifact. It's artificial, made by Neo Genesis—or at least, that's what my master and I believe. Someone in Neo Genesis has the ability to create void artifacts."

Thomas felt a jolt, as if struck by a heavy blow.

"Artificially made? That's..."

The implications were staggering.

If Neo Genesis had someone who could manufacture void artifacts, it would change everything.

The power shift would be unimaginable.

If that were true, Neo Genesis was far more dangerous than he'd ever considered.

"What does this void artifact do?"

Nol nodded, narrowing his eyes at the device.

"There aren't many like this one. It acts as a locator, allowing those who possess it to track each other's positions, as long as they're on the same floor in the void dungeon. It might even work in the void realm, though with a limited range."

Thomas's expression hardened.

It was impossible to use current technology or equipment to locate within the void dungeon or realm.

Scientists theorized it had to do with the mana or frequencies in those places.

"If we're here... and you have that device..." Thomas trailed off, realizing what it meant.

Nol nodded, glancing up at the building's rooftop ladder.

"Someone with a similar device is here, in the capital, waiting."

Nol turned to Thomas.

"For the sake of our masters, wouldn't it be wise to greet them?"

Nol's smile widened. Thomas, his expression darkening, gave a brief nod.

If there was indeed someone on the rooftop, he should have sensed it.

But he hadn't.

Which meant the person was either on the same level as him, or stronger, or perhaps using another void artifact.

Regardless, none of those were good options.

Thomas grew more cautious, approaching the ladder, Nol stepping aside.

'Most who were captured killed themselves with poison hidden beneath their tongues... The capital is still recovering from the recent attack, and most are being treated or consoled by the heroes and soldiers.'

Another fight breaking out here would be disastrous.

Without the element of surprise, casualties would skyrocket.

His eyes flicked to Nol.

'He must have a plan, surely.'

Instead of climbing the ladder, Thomas gripped Nol's shoulders.

In an instant, they found themselves on the rooftop.

Nol blinked, startled.

"So this is the speed of a Grandmaster... I think I might throw up my heavenly meal."

Not that he would.

Food was nearly as precious to him as his master.

As they approached the edge of the rooftop, Thomas's eyes widened.

A figure stood at the edge, gazing out at the streets below.

A man dressed in black.

Sensing their presence, the man turned.

Both Thomas and Nol froze.

A black cloth covered the man's eyes, yet he looked directly at them with a twisted smile.

'It's him...'

A chill ran through their veins.

Something was deeply, disturbingly wrong with this man.

The man in black gave a slight bow.

"Pleased to meet you again, Grandmaster Thomas. And honored to meet you, Sir Nol. Delegates of King Ragnar Frost and Apostle Azriel Crimson."

Thomas felt the man's gaze despite the cloth over his eyes.

It made his skin crawl.

'Delegates... And Apostle Azriel?'

The word "delegate" told Thomas everything he needed to know.

This was a negotiation.

But what unsettled him was the title of "Apostle" used for Azriel.

It was unfamiliar.

"Would it be polite to ask the name of the man before me?"

The man in black chuckled darkly.

"Ah, we didn't have time to chat earlier, thanks to the Heptarch of Ruin. Well, I'm nobody."

Thomas scowled, while Nol remained unreadable, his gaze cautious.

The man's smile faded, replaced by a cold expression.

The air grew thick as he took a step forward.

Instantly, a greatsword materialized in Thomas's hand.

"Move any closer, and I'll cut you down."

The man stopped, sighed, and spoke in a detached tone.

read only on m-vl _e|mp,yr

"I'm here for one reason. I received a message from the Supreme Archon."

Both Thomas and Nol tensed at the name.

The true mastermind behind Neo Genesis.

"I have a message," the man continued.

"Tell your master, Sir Nol—tell Prince Azriel Crimson to surrender. The Supreme Archon is willing to forgive this... rebellion."

Nol's eyes darkened, fury simmering beneath the surface.

"How dare you? A lowlife like you and that Supreme Archon dare to command my master?"

For a moment, it seemed Nol might strike the man down, but he composed himself, his expression returning to calm.

The man in black remained silent before continuing.

"I'm only a messenger. The prince is on the wrong side. Surrender, and we will forgive the death of Heptarch Zoran. In fact, we offer Zoran's position to him."

Both Thomas and Nol were stunned.

Neo Genesis was offering Azriel a seat as one of their leaders.

'Is the prince really worth that much?'

Thomas thought, though he doubted the man's words.

Nol's lips curled into a dangerous smile.

"You've delivered your message, now let me deliver mine."

Suddenly, Nol tapped his storage ring.

In an instant, he was holding a severed head, tossing it at the man's feet.

"Master formally declines your job offer. But he sends his regards with this gift."

Nol's smile twisted further.

"Now you have all seven heads back."

Chapter 116: Aftermath [4]

Nol's words were met with a tense silence that put Thomas on edge, his body instinctively ready to strike at the man in black.

The man in black stared coldly at Nol before silently crouching down, picking up Zoran's head with the black gloves he wore.

He placed it in his storage ring, that was slipped over the glove as if nothing were out of place.

Thomas had no idea how strong the man in black truly was.

He knew, at the very least, that he wasn't on Zoran's level—or so he believed.

But there was something off.

His battle sense failed to give him any real sense of the man's strength.

He knew Zoran, a Heptarch, was higher in rank within Neo Genesis, but strength didn't seem to dictate everything there.

Read exclusives on mvlemp _y,r.

If Azriel had been offered a position as a Heptarch, then power alone wasn't the only factor.

For all he knew, this man could be stronger than Zoran—who was a grade 2 saint, like Solomon.

Suddenly, as Thomas squinted, he noticed something.

'What…!'

His breath hitched, and a cold realization crept over him—something that answered the nagging questions he had about the man in black.

Something that made his blood run cold.

Goosebumps prickled across his skin as his body turned pale.

The man in black looked toward Thomas, his lips curling into a slight, mischievous grin, like someone who had been caught.

He was caught.

Thomas raised his greatsword, positioning it in front of him.

Nol, noticing the shift in tension, glanced between the two, confused.

But Nol was sharp.

Quietly, he took a few cautious steps back, eyes darting between Thomas and the man.

"I will be taking my leave now. Thank you for your time, Sir Nol, Grandmaster Thomas."

The man in black spoke softly, then turned his back and began walking toward the edge of the rooftop.

Thomas' eyes widened as he watched the man casually distance himself.

His back grew smaller with each step.

Just as Thomas was about to act, the man in black stopped.

Without turning fully, he looked over his shoulder, his voice cold as he spoke.

"If you and I were to fight right now... I would win."

The words hung in the air like a threat.

Thomas' expression darkened, but he hesitated.

Not because he feared losing.

No, that wasn't it.

He knew this man could fight him, and if they did, the chaos that would follow would spiral out of control.

It wasn't worth the risk. Not here. Not now.

The situation was too unfavorable.

So all Thomas could do was watch as the man in black jumped from the roof, disappearing before their eyes.

Thomas rushed to the edge, peering down.

But... there was nothing. He was gone. Vanished into the cold night.

Thomas turned to Nol, who wore a grim expression.

"...What did you find out?" Nol asked.

Thomas hesitated, his gaze shifting to the streets below. His voice was low, dark.

"That man… is no human."

Thomas gritted his teeth, his knuckles white around the hilt of his sword.

"It's a Grade 3 Titan... a skinwalker."

*****

An entire day had passed since Azriel had fallen asleep and woken up again.

The chaos in the sacred capital had subsided, but that didn't mean the citizens were no longer afraid.

Most of the heroes from various guilds, who had arrived first, had either started to retreat or were guarding the tents, all due to the presence of Azriel, Celestina, and Jasmine.

Government soldiers continued patrolling the capital, vigilant in case of further enemy attacks.

Azriel sat on his bed, his gaze fixed on Freya, who sat in a chair across from him, staring back coldly.

She was seated with her legs crossed, wearing a black dress.

The dress was simple yet commanding, with stiff fabric that wrapped around her like a second skin, its texture rough and devoid of elegance—suited for someone who prioritized battle over beauty.

Her rose-colored eyes were narrowed at him.

Any other man might have thanked the gods for having such a figure before him, but Azriel was different.

He looked at her with a dark expression.

"Are you here to admire your prince, or do you actually plan on saying something?"

Azriel asked, breaking the silence, sitting up straighter, his back now rigid.

Freya's eyes sharpened further at his harsh tone.

But Azriel had his reasons—the pressure she was emitting made him feel uneasy.

He was still exhausted, hoping to finally catch a break after everything had gone, if not perfectly, then at least as he had planned.

His right hand, reattached but still wrapped in bandages, throbbed slightly.

The healer had advised keeping the bandages on for two weeks, though Azriel didn't fully understand why, given that he could already move his hand with ease.

Still, he had complied.

Jasmine had retired to a private tent to get some much-needed sleep, and Freya, of course, had seized the opportunity to approach him while they were alone.

Before she could speak, Azriel interrupted again.

"And suppress that aura. I'm not your enemy, nor am I a subordinate you need to intimidate."

Freya's eyes stayed locked on him, analyzing his face, noticing the discomfort he was attempting to hide.

Her lips twitched, nearly curving into a smile, amused by the reaction of the usually composed prince.

'I shouldn't push my luck... Our relationship is already at rock bottom.'

Eventually, Freya withdrew her aura, and Azriel let out an audible sigh of relief.

Had it been anyone else, Freya might have taken their life on the spot, but Azriel wasn't just anyone.

He was a prince—though not the heir—and clearly favored by the Crimson Clan.

Besides, if she were to attack him now, there would be no escape.

The soldiers outside had seen her enter his tent alone, and even if she killed them too, the trail would eventually lead back to her.

The great clans were not to be underestimated.

Freya knew firsthand how terrifying they could be.

When Freya finally spoke, her tone was as cold as a blade poised to strike.

"Three hundred and nineteen people died in Neo Genesis's attack. Among them were ninety-four women, twenty-six children, and the rest men."

The air grew colder as Azriel stared back at her with a dark, unreadable expression.

"Their deaths could have been avoided if you and Solomon had simply followed the plan," Freya continued.

"But instead, the two of you had your own agenda and didn't even bother informing us when I assigned you the mission."

Disobeying a mission usually carried severe consequences, but Freya couldn't enforce anything here—not when Azriel had gambled and won.

He was responsible for the death of a Heptarch, a feat already stirring rumors across the Sacred Capital and soon, the entire world.

It was inevitable that the Crimson Clan would claim this victory under Azriel's name.

This would be Azriel Crimson's first official achievement as a prince: the slaying of a Heptarch.

Azriel's voice softened as he responded.

"I don't trust you. I didn't trust Instructor Salvator, or Instructor Juliet, or Instructor Ranni. I only trusted Solomon. If the price for killing someone like Zoran was the deaths of 319 people, then I think I got lucky. Keeping him alive would have led to far greater tragedy."

He continued.

"As for those 319 people, if you want me to mourn them, I'm sorry, but I won't. I don't deserve to. But if it would make you feel better, you can give me their names and faces, and I'll carry them with me for the rest of my life."

A heavy pause hung in the air between them.

The mood was solemn, and Freya, though listening to his words, knew he was right.

If not for Azriel's warning about Neo Genesis's plan to attack the Void Dungeon and their spies within the academy, the death toll would have been far worse.

In essence, Azriel had saved Asia today.

'If the first and second groups had met, the spies hiding in the second group might have slaughtered everyone, especially with Instructor Benson being a traitor. Yet, Azriel managed to handle everything.'

Freya sighed, her gaze softening slightly, her voice losing some of its edge.

"There's a rumor among the cadets. They're saying that alongside the Crimson Princess was a silver-haired blood devil who decapitated the terrorists on the first floor. And on the second floor, a blonde knight and a green-eyed archer slaughtered hundreds of undead, saving countless cadets."

'That silver-haired boy… Cadet Nol, the one who entered the academy with Azriel. I thought he was just a normal servant, but now I see. He was Azriel's trump card against the second group. An intermediate rank that Instructor Benson hadn't accounted for.'

Undoubtedly, Benson must have panicked when Jasmine appeared.

He probably thought dealing with Azriel would be easier, planning to eliminate Jasmine with the others' help afterward.

But none of it worked.

Instructor Benson and his men had all fallen to a single boy.

"Nol is one of mine," Azriel said, his tone firm.

"You don't need to worry about him. I'll speak to him about his… actions. As for Lumine and Yelena, I have nothing to say about them. They seem like good people. Heroes, undoubtedly."

Freya frowned.

'I understand his lack of trust, but can he be any more reckless?'

"Are you not afraid you could have died?" Freya asked, her voice tightening.

"In fact, you've lied to me three times. I could ignore all consequences right now and kill you, then run."

Azriel looked at her for a few moments before breaking into a smile.

"Of course, I fear death. Who doesn't? But if you want to kill me, Headmistress, go ahead. Take my head and run for the rest of your life. I'm sure someone with your abilities could manage to never get caught. But would I do it all again?

Without hesitation."

Chapter 117: Aftermath [5]

If anyone had oerheard the conversation between the two, they would have undoubtedly felt the urge to flee.

That was how uncomfortable the tension between Azriel and Freya had become.

The saddest part was that Azriel and Freya didn't dislike each other out of simple animosity—it was because they knew, deep down, they couldn't trust one another.

Each was aware that the other would seize any opportunity to exploit the situation, just as Azriel had done before.

Freya eventually sighed, tapping her fingers on the armrest.

"What's done is done, I suppose... You did well, my prince."

Azriel looked slightly surprised by the sudden acknowledgment, watching as Freya turned her head toward the entrance of the tenth.

"Do you know what I want?" she asked.

"I imagine you must have an idea."

Azriel looked at her quietly before responding in a soft voice.

"...A true hero."

'So, he does know.'

Freya's lips curved slightly—a rare sight that could have captivated anyone entering the tenth at that moment.

"Indeed, a true hero," she said.

"This incident has shown me who runs from danger and who charges toward it, who leads and who follows, who is capable and who isn't. Before all this, I thought I knew the answer... and that answer was you. But now..."

Azriel smiled, his gaze now fixed on the entrance.

"You've set your sights on Lumine, haven't you?"

Freya nodded, her thoughts racing.

'How did he get so strong? No matter how much I tried to dig into his past, there was nothing—no records of battles or major fights. Could his talent really be that immense?'

"Before my fight with Instructor Benson, I watched the cadets—each and every one of them."

Freya's eyes widened slightly—a rare reaction—as she turned to Azriel, who remained focused on the entrance.

"This year is truly talented. It makes me wonder if my years spent in the void realm were wasted. Perhaps it should've been them instead."

'Is he feeling... insecure?'

Though surprised, Freya understood what he meant.

Two years in the void realm—fighting, surviving—yet he rose only to a Grade 3 Intermediate.

'But then again, he had no formal training, no notable achievements at the time. He was young and yet… he survived. Came out stronger.'

Freya considered offering words of support, but their relationship was too complex for that.

"Princess Celestina's fight against the Dark King was... underwhelming," Azriel remarked.

"She already has experience, but she was also overwhelming in sheer power. If she grows, most won't stand a chance against her."

That was, of course, if she learned to control her [Unique Skill].

Freya and the others didn't know, but Azriel did.

Celestina avoided using her [Unique Skill] out of fear she might lose control.

But if she ever mastered it... the thought both terrified and excited Azriel.

"Cadet Lumine has an affinity for fire, though I suspect he may have a dual—or even multiple—affinities."

"...!"

Freya's eyes opened fully, her shock apparent.

'More than two affinities!?'

If true, Lumine would be the first human to possess such power.

"Cadet Yelena has an affinity for mana manipulation, shaping it to her will. As for Cadet Vergil… I'm uncertain. His affinity seems related to the mind, at the very least."

Azriel didn't stop.

One by one, he recounted the abilities of the cadets he had observed.

Freya listened quietly, recognizing the value of this information.

Finally, Azriel turned toward her.

"You want a true hero. Someone to nurture, someone who can lead us to victory in a battle we are doomed to lose..."

Freya's breath caught.

'He knows...!'

Of course, he did.

'He has been to the undiscovered parts of the void realm...'

Who knew what secrets he had uncovered there?

Azriel's eyes were clear as he spoke.

"Become Lumine's mentor."

Freya blinked, processing his words.

"If you want a true hero," Azriel continued, "you have to train him. He's risen to this level on his own. Imagine how much more he could achieve with someone like you guiding him. Not just Lumine, but Yelena as well. Celestina has her own path to walk as a princess and a hero. After all of this, she'll undoubtedly work on herself.

We should leave her to it."

Freya found herself unable to argue.

Azriel was right.

If she took Lumine and perhaps Yelena under her wing, they would soar to new heights.

With the Tournament of the Greats approaching, someone like Lumine might even win the first-year bracket.

'I can't waste this opportunity.'

Freya thought, turning back to those scarlet eyes of his.

"And what about you?" she asked.

Though they weren't on the best terms, if Azriel asked her to mentor him as well, Freya would accept.

He was vital to the future—prince or not—and undeniably talented.

'Besides, I have heard he's never had anyone properly train him. Everything he's done has almost been self-taught.'

Even though Azriel had defeated Benson, a man ranked higher than himself, there was still room for improvement—especially considering the state in which he had emerged from the Void Dungeon.

Azriel looked briefly surprised before breaking into a smile.

"Me? Oh, I'll be training a lot from now on. You don't have to worry about me getting involved with another terrorist organization."

'That's a relief...'

Freya sighed in quiet amusement. Had he come to her the next day announcing another terrorist threat, she might've strangled him on the spot.

"Do you want me to mentor you as well?"

Azriel's smile turned grateful as he shook his head.

"Thank you for the offer, but... I already have someone in mind."

He glanced back at the entrance, his smile turning sad.

"If I can find her... and if she's not mad at me anymore, that is."

*****

Azriel stared at the entrance, where Freya had left moments ago, the silence in the room settling back in.

Even though everything was finally over, his thoughts lingered on how close it had all come to collapsing.

'If Zoran hadn't been so obsessed with preserving the second floor, Solomon would've had a much harder time.'

There was even a chance Solomon might've lost—especially with Zoran having consumed the blood of a Voidwalker.

But Zoran had made a crucial mistake. One he wasn't even aware of.

He had challenged Solomon to a battle of [Soul Domain].

Azriel sighed, flexing his right hand, watching it move as if nothing had happened.

It was restored, yet there was a strange, lingering sensation.

He was about to rise from the bed when his body froze, eyes widening as a series of panels blinked into existence before him.

Azriel's breath caught in his throat as the panels flashed before him, too fast to process. He could barely keep up.

Azriel inhaled sharply, goosebumps rising across his skin as a wave of cold dread swept through him. His throat felt dry, his body frozen in place. The word on the screen burned into his vision.

: [...It was nice knowing you, however brief.]

'What...?'

Azriel's mind went blank as more panels erupted before his eyes. The sheer volume overwhelmed him, each message adding to the chaos swirling in his head.

[ • Main Quest Completed: Defeat the Apostle of Ruin, Zoran.]

[ • Side Quest Completed: Defeat the leader, Benson, and his allies.]

Azriel felt like he was floating, euphoria flooding every part of his body as an electric pulse of energy surged through him.

[ • Quest Reward: Staying alive!]

: [System will now shut down.]

: [Status updated!]

: [...Goodbye.]

He blinked, staring at the last panel.

After what seemed like an eternity, piecing together the whirlwind of information he'd just witnessed, a hollow laugh escaped his lips.

"This… What am I supposed to say about this?"

Chapter 118: Regret [1]

A few hours after the system shut down, Azriel could only hold back his tears, waiting until he was alone in his bed to cry.

Why?

Because everyone was allowed to return to the academy or go home.

Naturally, the four great clans were enraged by the situation and had each sent their own armies: the Dusk Army, the Nebula Army, the Frost Army, and the Crimson Army.

The guilds affiliated with them were also dispatched immediately.

Of course, Celestina would be escorted with the help of Grandmaster Thomas and the Frost Army, while the same would happen with Azriel and Jasmine.

For such an event to occur, the academy—specifically Freya—would face a lot of backlash, but she would manage.

Hell, she had barely managed when the death toll in the book was in the thousands, so now?

She should be fine.

Azriel stood inside his private tent with Jasmine, waiting for their escort to arrive.

"How's your hand?" Jasmine asked, her expression concerned as she looked at Azriel's bandaged hand.

Smiling, Azriel lifted his right hand, clenching and opening it in front of her.

"Perfectly fine now. See?"

Jasmine narrowed her eyes but hummed, seeing that he didn't seem to be in pain anymore.

Then, her gaze drifted to another spot.

Azriel was simply wearing a black t-shirt and pants, having changed out of his torn academy clothes after Freya left.

It wasn't exactly what he should be wearing in public, but he didn't have a choice—there was nothing else, and he wasn't interested in wearing any military gear.

'I still have the clothes Solomon gave me back in Europe though…'

It might come in handy someday.

Speaking of Solomon, he had visited Azriel earlier to check on his condition before heading toward the cadets staying at the hotel.

His presence wasn't really needed anymore, not with all the other people around to protect them.

Instead, it was better for him to ensure nothing happened to the cadets.

'At least he's happy with Zoran's mana core...'

Though it pained him, Azriel understood it was only natural for Solomon to claim Zoran's core.

He had killed him, after all.

Even though taking mana cores from humans was frowned upon, Azriel didn't have much of a choice with [Core Reaper], while Solomon… well, he simply didn't care.

The negative view on harvesting mana cores from humans was a rule the four great clans had intentionally made.

They'd spread rumors and laws about it to control certain things.

Most people didn't even know it was possible to absorb a human's mana core.

What choice did they have?

The four great clans had to maintain control, or chaos would break out.

Jasmine hesitated for a moment before speaking, pulling Azriel out of his thoughts.

"I've noticed you've been wearing that since we came back to the surface, but… why is your entire left arm bandaged? Is there an injury there too that the healers missed?"

She was staring at his left arm, which made sense—he was wearing a sleeveless t-shirt.

Azriel glanced down at his bandaged arm, the fresh wrappings he'd put on a few hours ago.

He looked back at Jasmine.

'It's exhausting trying to hide this all the time.'

He didn't particularly mind her seeing the mark of the Son of Death, but he preferred if she didn't.

m _vl _em _p _yr only

Maybe if he were the Apostle of Life or Dreams, it would be different, but...

The Apostle of Death, if known to all, would naturally be seen negatively through human eyes.

Azriel spoke softly.

"This? It's an injury, yes... but not one I got in the Void Dungeon. It's from the Void Realm. Even if I became an advanced, it wouldn't heal."

Jasmine's eyes widened as the air between them grew solemn.

She bit her lip, staring at his bandaged arm.

"Does it hurt…?"

Azriel chuckled and shook his head.

"No, not really. But I'd rather keep it hidden. It's not something most people would want to see."

Catching his meaning, Jasmine nodded and backed off from the subject.

'How understanding.'

He felt grateful to have such a sister.

'I should show her more appreciation…'

He nodded to himself, pleased by his own selfless thoughts—after all, that's who he was.

A selfless, honorable person.

Perhaps to lighten the mood, Jasmine smirked at him suddenly.

"You know, Mom's been nagging me for the past hour on the phone… She has a lot to say to you. I managed to keep her from calling, telling her you were fine, but once we're back home? I'm not so sure."

A cold wave of dread washed over Azriel's entire body, his face showing panic as he looked at Jasmine and processed her words.

'Oh shit…'

He had totally forgotten.

His mother.

She was definitely going to kill him.

'Wait, wait… Dad will understand, and he'll calm her d—'

Azriel's thoughts darkened as he remembered the… dynamic between his parents.

His dad might be the Crimson King, but his mother was the queen.

A queen who ruled her subjects—namely his dad.

'…How can someone so feared be so useless?'

Azriel looked at Jasmine with a pleading expression, but she averted her eyes, glancing at him pitifully from time to time.

Her intentions were clear: he was on his own for this one.

A dry laugh escaped his lips.

'First the system shuts down without even giving me a reward, and now I'm entering a new "main event" that's possibly more dangerous than what I just completed.'

Things didn't seem good.

At the very least, despite that useless system of his and the creepy panels that came with it, he had gained a lot from the event's experience.

Now?

He was extremely close to becoming a Grade 1 Intermediate.

Just like that.

Before he could dwell on his despair, the curtain of the tent opened, and a man with a typical buzz cut walked in, straightening his posture.

"I greet Prince Azriel and Princess Jasmine of the Crimson Clan," the man said, thumping his right fist against his chest as he bowed.

Jasmine nodded, her expression cold.

'Was she always this cold-looking…?'

Azriel thought, puzzled.

"You may look up," she said, her voice equally cold.

'And this cold-sounding?!'

Perhaps he had been so doted on by Jasmine that he had never noticed how she appeared to others.

Even the book never mentioned how she acted in front of other people since she had been cold from the very beginning after Azriel's death.

But now he was alive.

The man straightened his posture but didn't dare meet her eyes.

"There are two people claiming to be from the Crimson Clan waiting outside the tent, ready to escort both of you to EASC."

Azriel watched silently as Jasmine crossed her arms and nodded.

"Let them in."

The man hurriedly bowed again and left the tent.

Azriel glanced at Jasmine but decided it was best not to say anything.

Frankly… she was scary.

Another person walked in.

Azriel and Jasmine's eyes widened in shock and recognition at who it was.

She wore the dark crimson military uniform of the Crimson Army, a black furred coat draped over her shoulders.

Golden medals and badges of achievement were pinned on her chest.

Her scarlet hair flowed down her back like blood, and her golden eyes, like two suns, locked onto Azriel.

Her presence radiated authority and demanded respect.

Those golden eyes trembled as she thumped her right fist against her chest and went down on one knee.

"I greet my prince and my princess…"

Her voice quivered slightly.

Azriel knew exactly who she was.

Of course he did—he didn't even need his memories or the knowledge of the book.

'Mira Emberhart… commander of the Crimson Army and my father's right hand.'

"Lady Mira, you're back from the Void Realm?"

Jasmine spoke first, utterly stunned.

Mira smiled up at her before standing.

She nodded.

"I am. My king commanded me to return to EASC just a few days ago. He's still there for reasons I'm not aware of."

Her gaze shifted to Azriel, locking onto him.

"My prince… I heard of your return the moment I arrived."

A solemn look passed over her face as she lowered her head.

"If I had known you were in the Void Realm all this time… I would've searched every corner."

Azriel looked at her for a few moments, silence filling the tent, before he broke out in a soft smile.

"Lady Mira, I don't blame you or anyone else. What happened wasn't your fault. I'm just grateful to be alive and reunited with my family again."

Mira looked up, her eyes wide, before breaking into a small smile, though they still held a trace of sadness.

Azriel knew her well from his childhood.

She cared deeply about both him and Jasmine, and they felt the same toward her.

There were only three people Azriel had spent most of his childhood with—Jasmine, and Mira was one of them.

She had always been the one guarding over the Crimson Duo.

"You've grown splendidly, my prince… I'm truly grateful for your return."

Azriel nodded with a smile, but his brows furrowed as he remembered something.

"That soldier mentioned there were two of you. Who else is here?"

Unexpectedly, Mira's smile widened even more as she stepped aside, allowing the other person to enter.

When she did, both Azriel and Jasmine's eyes widened once more, though for different reasons.

Her long black hair flowed down her back, and her obsidian eyes trembled as they locked onto Azriel.

"Ah…"

A sound escaped Azriel's lips as he took in the sight of her.

Just hours ago, he had been afraid to meet her, yet here she was, standing right in front of him.

Jasmine didn't speak.

She didn't feel like she should, simply glancing between the two, confused.

The third person Azriel had spent his childhood with—his personal maid, someone he looked up to as another mother.

"…Amaya…"

The moment he uttered her name, instead of kneeling, she rushed toward him.

Chapter 119: Regret [2]

In the next second, Azriel blinked, and suddenly his vision tilted as his head smacked hard against the edge of the bed.

"Argh..."

Wincing in pain, he found himself unable to move as Amaya clung tightly to him, soaking his shirt with her tears.

"I-I thought you were dead, my prince! The moment I heard you were alive a few days ago, I wanted to rush here immediately!"

She cried, and Azriel's face softened with guilt as he sighed quietly, gently stroking her long hair.

There were many things Azriel regretted from his previous life, things he had done before dying that day.

But one of the biggest regrets was this: the fight he and Amaya had had.

She hadn't wanted him to go to the military base, and Azriel, stubborn as always, hadn't listened.

In the end, he had died by the Void rifts.

Jasmine and Mira stood by, confused, watching Azriel's face contort with regret as he averted his eyes.

They didn't know anything about what had happened between him and Amaya before that fateful day.

They remained silent as Amaya continued to hug Azriel, unwilling to let go.

Eventually, without looking at her, Azriel spoke softly.

"...I'm sorry."

His words only deepened the confusion on Jasmine and Mira's faces, but Amaya slowly looked up.

Azriel felt a pang in his heart when he saw her red, tear-streaked eyes.

He couldn't meet her gaze for long, so he looked away again, the emotions he inherited weighing on him.

He could feel the immense regret enveloping him.

"...Please, don't say that," Amaya whispered, resting her forehead against his chest.

"I'm just happy you're back."

She took a shaky breath before continuing.

"My foolish prince... ever since you were little, you never listened or did what was expected of you. So, I can only be grateful that you're still alive."

Azriel finally looked at her, seeing her smile brightly up at him.

He was at a loss for words.

In the end, all he could do was return a smile.

*****

Lumine sat quietly on one of the soft couches in the hotel lobby, watching the scene unfold before him.

Yelena sat beside him, both of them overwhelmed by the crowd of cadets in front of them.

"You really are incredible, Cadet Lumine! To slay so many skeletons with a fire sword—how cool!"

"Cadet Yelena, watching you felt like I was seeing someone with aimbot!"

"Seriously, both of you are so talented, and you fight so well together!"

The cadets continued praising them one after another, admiring their achievements.

Lumine and Yelena could only smile awkwardly, unsure of what to say in response to their admiration.

This was all new to them.

Undoubtedly, some of the cadets were trying to build connections with the two.

After all, Lumine and Yelena weren't from any prestigious families, making them appear as easy targets for networking.

The same couldn't be said for another person sitting a little farther away on a separate couch.

Ignoring the praises, Lumine's gaze shifted toward that person, who had his eyes closed, head leaning back.

'Cadet Nol...'

No one dared to sit near him.

Out of fear.

Perhaps noticing Lumine's gaze, the other cadets followed suit, glancing at Nol before quickly turning their heads and whispering among themselves.

"You've heard about him, right?"

"Yeah, he fought with Princess Jasmine... they call him the Silver Blood Devil."

"They say he ate the heads of all the terrorists he fought..."

"W-what a terrifying person..."

Lumine and Yelena exchanged glances, their eyes narrowing in unison as they observed Nol, who seemed completely oblivious to the rumors swirling around him.

'I knew it. He's been hiding his strength all along.'

From the first moment he met Nol, he could sense the hidden power within him.

Of course, Lumine didn't really believe the rumors about Nol eating the heads of terrorists, but it was clear that Nol had done something to earn such fear and notoriety.

Then again, it could also be because more information had surfaced about him being a servant who had come to the academy with Azriel.

Speaking of Azriel...

'So much has been happening...'

Lumine's thoughts darkened as he remembered Neo Genesis' attack.

He had failed his quest by not saving Cadet Kanae's life.

But then again, the system had given him a quest to ensure no cadets died.

It could have assigned him a specific quest to save Kanae, but it hadn't.

That meant the system had expected more cadets to die.

Yet none did.

All because of Azriel.

Azriel, who had killed a Heptarch and taken down Neo Genesis members on the second floor, while Nol and the Crimson Princess handled the rest on the first floor—all under Azriel's orders.

The system hadn't predicted Azriel's actions, and as a result, Lumine had almost nothing to do except fight skeletons that didn't even have mana cores.

They were being controlled by something—or someone—but weren't particularly strong.

There were just a lot of them.

But it made Lumine wonder: if they had stayed longer, would they have encountered whoever was behind the skeletons?

Did he even want that?

'How long has all of this been planned...?'

Lumine realized just how clueless he was about what was truly going on in the world.

He wasn't part of one of the four great clans, but still, was this normal for them?

He didn't think so.

And yet, he was also worried about Azriel, especially after seeing his missing right hand.

But unfortunately, Lumine couldn't leave the hotel yet.

A sudden clap echoed through the lobby, halting everyone's movements as they turned toward the entrance.

"Instructor Solomon..!"

"Can we finally leave the hotel?"

"I just want to sleep in my own bed..."

Solomon grinned as he walked toward the center of the room, ignoring their complaints and questions.

His eyes locked onto Lumine, sending a shiver down Lumine's spine.

For some reason, Solomon's eyes...

They reminded him of a predator.

Lumine gulped as Solomon blinked, and in the next second, he was standing right in front of him, making Lumine's breath catch in his throat.

Solomon leaned in closer, far too close.

"I've heard a lot about you... quite the hero, Cadet Lumine."

He turned to Yelena.

"And you as well, Cadet Yelena. Both of you have made sure no one died."

Yelena was the first to regain her composure.

She bowed slightly, her voice quiet.

"What we achieved is nothing compared to Prince Azriel."

Solomon nodded, acknowledging her words.

"Azriel is Azriel. You two are yourselves. If everyone acted like him, this world would collapse."

His words, though cryptic, carried weight.

Words that could have had several meanings and consequences.

Yet Solomon didn't seem to care.

He didn't have to.

Though the rumors credited Azriel with killing Heptarch Zoran, everyone here knew it had been Solomon who delivered the fatal blow.

'I need to grow stronger,' Lumine thought, his expression growing grim.

He had realized just how weak he was—not just physically, but in many other ways as well.

If it weren't for Azriel today...

Who knew what kind of tragedy might have happened?

'Everyone owes him because of this...'

Indeed, a sense of admiration began to take root in Lumine's mind for Azriel.

He was a true hero, someone who had given his hand—and nearly his life—for the sake of everyone.

Solomon laughed, addressing the group.

"The prince and princesses will be leaving in a few hours. Cadet Nol, you're requested to head to the Tenths immediately. As for the rest of you, start packing up. We're returning to the academy. As compensation for this ordeal, the academy is granting all of you a week-long break. You can stay in your dorms or go home once we arrive."

The cadets' faces brightened at Solomon's words, and they began cheering.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged a glance and smiled. They had both missed their families. Though it hadn't been that long, the Void Dungeon had been an exhausting experience.

They needed some rest.

Nol finally opened his eyes and, without a word or a glance at anyone, walked out of the hotel, his expression unreadable.

The cadets tensed, their chatter dying instantly as if afraid any sound might provoke him.

Solomon's lips curled into a twisted smile, his gaze following Nol.

But Nol remained indifferent, his steps steady and unhurried, oblivious to the reactions swirling in his wake as he disappeared from sight.

Just like that.

Lumine watched him go with a bitter smile.

'I can't tell what he's thinking...'

It was strange.

Lumine shook his head as he was about to stand up and go pack his belongings.

But before he could, a system notification flashed in front of his vision.

He glanced at it, noticing it was a sudden quest.

Furrowing his brows, Lumine began to read, and as he did, his eyes widened in disbelief.

It felt as though a cold wave had crashed against him, draining the blood from his face as his body trembled.

'This...!'

He immediately regretted letting his guard down, allowing himself to relax too soon.

Lumine's thoughts stalled as he reread the objective, unable to believe it.

The quest reward was 50,000 SP—an entire zero added compared to his previous reward.

But the task itself…

The quest…

To rescue the Crimson King who had ventured into the Void Realm.

Chapter 120: A Delicate Dilemma

"Why the hell are both of you following me?"

Nol finally stopped in front of the heavily-guarded barrier, soldiers standing watch inside and out.

He turned around, his gaze landing on the two figures behind him—Yelena and Lumine.

He had noticed them trailing him not five minutes after he left.

He had waited, hoping they would either stop or confront him, but neither happened.

Lumine met Nol's eyes with a complicated expression, while Yelena cast a sidelong glance at Lumine, her gaze echoing the same question Nol had:

Why were they here?

Eventually, Lumine sighed and stepped closer to Nol.

"I need to speak with Azriel."

It was the only thing on his mind.

He had no time limit, but he didn't have much information either.

The idea of King Joaquin needing to be rescued—and the quest he had received because of it—felt ridiculous.

Yet, if he completed it, the reward would make him rich in system points.

Since Azriel and Jasmine were already here, at the very least, he could try to gather information.

Maybe they were planning to rescue King Joaquin, and he could assist them.

At least, he hoped.

Honestly, Lumine was nervous.

The events of the past few days had been overwhelming, and he wasn't sure how to approach Azriel about it.

But he knew he had to try. Even without the incentive of system points, he felt indebted to Azriel—someone he admired.

Yelena looked confused, while Nol stared at him with a skeptical expression.

"Why?"

Nol asked, his voice sharp.

Lumine feared this question, knowing he had no solid answer.

He stepped forward and spoke softly, so only the three of them could hear.

"I can't tell you the details, but... it's extremely important."

Nol scoffed.

"Important? You think I'll let you see Master, who could be assassinated at any moment by Neo Genesis, just because you say it's important?"

Lumine pursed his lips, knowing Nol was right.

Azriel was the most famous person in the capital right now, and soon, the whole world would hear of his achievements.

He had attracted attention—the kind that came with both admiration and danger.

Nol ignored Lumine's words and turned toward the gate where two soldiers, clad in dark crimson uniforms of the Crimson Army, stood watch.

The capital was becoming more organized by the second, and soon, everything would be secured once more.

"Halt. Name, purpose of entry, and who gave permission to come here," one of the soldiers demanded.

Nol bowed slightly.

"My name is Nol. Master requested me to come to him immediately."

The soldiers eyed him with suspicion.

"And who is this Master of yours?"

Nol grinned.

"Prince Azriel Crimson."

At the mention of Azriel's name, the soldiers' expressions hardened.

They glanced between Nol and the others before one of them spoke.

"We received word that someone matching your description would arrive, Sir Nol, but please wait while we confirm your identity."

Nol wasn't surprised.

With reports of Neo Genesis somehow possessing face-altering abilities, it wasn't unreasonable for them to be cautious.

One of the soldiers left to relay the message, disappearing into the sea of tents.

"Wait, Nol! I'm serious... just give me a minute to talk to Azriel!"

Lumine pleaded.

Nol's face twitched, and the soldier glanced at Lumine and Yelena, confused.

"Are these two with you, Sir Nol?"

With a sigh, Nol shook his head.

"Not yet, no."

He then stepped closer to Lumine.

"You have one chance," he said coldly.

Lumine was surprised by the sudden shift in Nol's tone but nodded, determined.

Nol's frustration was evident—he hated the title he had been given: Silver-Blood Devil.

It was a name that made his skin crawl, and being separated from Azriel only worsened his mood.

Yelena watched silently from behind as Lumine, having steeled himself, approached Nol, standing just an arm's length away.

"Please listen to me. I can't explain how, but there's a chance King Joaquin is in danger..."

The moment those words left Lumine's mouth, Nol's expression turned icy.

His aura surged, becoming unbearably oppressive. Instinctively, Lumine leaped back, while Yelena's face hardened, her bow already in hand.

The soldiers around them tensed, their faces growing stern.

"Sir Nol, what is the meaning of this?" the soldier asked coldly, but Nol ignored him, his eyes locked onto Lumine.

"It would be in your best interest not to joke about things like that, Lumine. Master may tolerate you, but if I sense you're a threat to him, I won't hesitate to erase you."

Nol's words were harsh, and Yelena narrowed her eyes, while Lumine kept his gaze steady, a grim expression on his face.

He didn't want to fight Nol, but he understood why Nol reacted that way.

From Nol's perspective, Lumine's words were those of a madman.

'...Shit. What should I do?'

Lumine's thoughts spiraled as his face darkened.

He needed to convince Nol he wasn't lying, but at the same time, he had to avoid appearing as a threat.

Yelena cautiously moved toward Lumine, about to speak, but before she could, another aura emerged, as someone else appeared between Lumine and Nol.

Lumine blinked, his heart racing.

This new presence was far more overwhelming than Nol's, forcing him to suppress his own aura.

He gulped as his gaze settled on a red-haired woman, her mere presence making him feel like an ant.

'...A Grandmaster...!'

"I didn't think this generation was foolish enough to start a fight in such chaotic times," the woman said, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade.

Everyone flinched, but before the situation could escalate further, another voice sounded as the gates creaked open.

"Please, Lady Mira, forgive them. It's been a stressful few days for everyone. It's natural for them to be on edge."

All heads snapped toward the speaker, and Lumine's eyes widened.

There, standing in front of the gate, was Azriel, with Jasmine at his side, and just behind him, a black-haired woman dressed in the same crimson military uniform as Mira.

'Azriel!'

It felt like a stroke of luck seeing him here.

Instantly, the soldiers, including Nol, saluted Azriel and Jasmine.

Even Lumine and Yelena, feeling awkward, mimicked the gesture.

Though they knew Azriel and Jasmine personally, it was clear that they were no longer being treated as mere cadets.

The differences between him and Yelena compared to Azriel and Jasmine were becoming more pronounced.

Mira's oppressive aura dissipated, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

Nol started toward Azriel, but before he could take a step, the black-haired woman, Amaya, appeared in front of Azriel, blocking his path.

She narrowed her eyes at Nol.

"You too, Amaya. Don't worry about Nol; you can trust him," Azriel said gently.

Amaya looked skeptical but eventually stepped aside, her gaze still wary.

Jasmine, meanwhile, remained expressionless, hiding her boredom.

'All of them... members of the Crimson Clan...'

It was overwhelming for Lumine, who had never encountered such influential figures before.

Though he didn't know the two women, he could tell they were incredibly strong.

The red-haired one, a Grandmaster, and the black-haired one, a Master.

"Master! You won't believe the ridiculous name they've started calling me!"

Nol suddenly exclaimed, his unreadable expression replaced by one of despair.

"The Silver-Blood Devil!"

Azriel laughed awkwardly.

"I'm sure it will be forgotten in no time... probably."

Nol didn't seem reassured, sulking as he turned to face Amaya with curiosity.

"Nol. This is Amaya. Amaya, this is Nol. You'll be seeing a lot of each other, so get acquainted."

Amaya sighed and nodded, while Nol seemed to process Azriel's words.

Ignoring them both, Azriel glanced at Jasmine, who finally spoke up.

"One hour."

Azriel's smile widened as he thanked her, then turned his attention to Lumine.

"It must be extremely important for you to go through all this trouble to meet me right now. Well, you heard the princess—you have an hour to explain."

Lumine felt a weight lift from his shoulders at Azriel's words.

He wasn't sure why, but there was this urgent feeling gnawing at him, like he needed to save the Crimson King as fast as possible.

It was strange.

Before stepping forward, he glanced at Yelena. But before he could say anything, she cut him off with a stern voice.

"Forget about leaving me behind. I don't know what's going on, but there's no way I'm letting you deal with this alone, surrounded by wolves. Besides, I'm curious too."

Lumine smiled slightly at her response.

Seeing the situation calming down again, the soldiers under Mira's sharp gaze resumed their duties, visibly trembling.

Mira walked over to join Azriel and Jasmine.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged a glance and a nod before following Mira toward the group.

"You better be prepared to explain yourselves, Cadet Lumine, Cadet Yelena. Because of you two, we've delayed our plans to return home, putting our lives—and others—at risk," Jasmine said, her tone sharp.

Lumine nodded firmly, speaking politely.

"If you could just hear me out somewhere private, I promise I can explain."

Jasmine narrowed her scarlet eyes, her expression unreadable.

After a moment, she closed her eyes and turned away.

"Let's go to one of the tents."

Chapter 121: Investigate

Inside the private tent, Azriel sat on the bed with Jasmine beside him, while Mira was seated in a chair nearby.

Yelena and Lumine stood before them, with Amaya and Nol stationed by the bed, their gazes watchful.

Jasmine raised an eyebrow, while Azriel remained silent, observing.

"We're in private now. You'd better explain what was so urgent," Jasmine said, her tone firm.

Lumine clenched his fists, nodding.

He glanced at Jasmine, a cold sweat forming on his back under the weight of everyone's stares.

Though he had met the Crimson Princess before, they weren't even acquaintances.

Azriel narrowed his eyes, silently curious.

'...Bold enough to come to me now? It must be important, but why?'

No one dared to approach the highest authorities in the capital—especially the children of the great clans.

Not with everything that had happened and what was still to come.

After Neo Genesis' attack, if Jasmine, Azriel, or Celestina issued a command, the guilds and armies aligned with them would follow. Even the government, known for its neutrality, would obey.

Yet neither Jasmine nor Azriel saw the need to issue any orders.

The situation was delicate, and their safety wasn't fully assured.

It was best to leave the capital as soon as possible.

Most cadets were eager to escape for their own safety, making Lumine and Yelena's presence here all the more puzzling—especially with the serious expression on Lumine's face.

"Everyone here can be trusted. Nothing leaves this tent. You don't need to doubt their loyalty," Jasmine said, sensing Lumine's hesitation.

He sighed, nodding.

"I know this might sound ridiculous, maybe even crazy, but hear me out first. There's a chance King Joaquin is in danger."

A thick silence fell over the room, deafening in its intensity.

Mira and Amaya narrowed their eyes dangerously at Lumine and Yelena, causing the two to pale.

Just days ago, they had met Joaquin, and now this boy claimed their king was at risk.

Who would believe that?

Yet, they held back, choosing to listen.

Jasmine, Nol, and Yelena all eyed Lumine with a strange expression, while Azriel...

He had his eyes closed, wearing an unreadable expression.

'...Dad, in danger? No. But why is Lumine already getting a quest about this? What's even happening—didn't I break the original future?'

In the book, Joaquin's rescue was an event that happened much later, after Lumine won the Tournament of the Greats.

Only then did Lumine receive a quest to save Joaquin, and Jasmine, having already heard of her father's danger, naturally returned to help.

They had traveled together to EASC and eventually to the Void Realm, where they rescued him.

It was one of the key moments that softened Jasmine toward Lumine in the story.

'Could it be… my actions couldn't change this event?'

Despite this, Azriel wasn't too worried.

He knew what happened to Joaquin—and he knew his father was fine.

Joaquin was one of the Four Great Kings.

Even if Lumine had ignored the quest in the original story, nothing would have happened to Joaquin; his return would simply have been delayed.

'The Sunken Islands... his way back was destroyed after an attack, leaving him trapped there. He could've escaped on his own, but he wasn't alone. Abandoning his men would have meant their deaths, so he waited. He knew help would come eventually.'

Joaquin couldn't afford to show weakness, so the news of him being trapped was kept highly restricted.

Especially in the Void Realm, secrecy was vital.

Lumine and Jasmine's intervention had been the turning point in the story.

Lumine had gained favor with the Crimson King that day.

Azriel's mood darkened.

'Damn harem protagonist...'

He couldn't help but be reminded of what kind of person Lumine was in the book.

Still, Azriel's presence seemed to have blocked any romantic progress with Jasmine or Celestina—leaving only Yelena.

'Anastasia is still a potential victim though...'

Azriel shook his head, dispelling those thoughts as he listened to Lumine's nervous explanation.

"I... I have a [Unique Skill]. It lets me know things that might happen—or have happened—but it's inconsistent. That's why I didn't foresee the Void Dungeon incident. But I did know about King Joaquin."

Azriel opened his eyes, staring blankly at Lumine.

Even a fool could see he was lying.

Jasmine's gaze turned cold, while Yelena tensed, though she remained silent.

"So... you're a seer?" Jasmine asked, her voice icy.

Seers, those who could glimpse the future, were rare.

Even the few who existed were often unreliable, their visions too vague to be of much use.

Lumine shook his head, his expression complicated.

"Not exactly. It's hard to explain, but I swear I'm not lying! King Joaquin is truly in danger!"

Azriel sighed inwardly.

'This kid has a lot of character development ahead of him…'

Still, they were all young.

What Azriel liked most in the story was watching them grow, one by one.

'At least now I can see it happening with my own eyes.'

Azriel smirked inwardly.

'I should probably help him out.'

Breaking his silence, Azriel finally spoke, his relaxed voice drawing the attention of everyone in the tent.

"You seem restricted from telling the full truth, likely due to your [Unique Skill]. But regardless, it's worth investigating this matter."

Lumine looked at Azriel as if he were a god, while the others eyed him strangely.

"My prince, you're being far too casual about this," Amaya scolded, her brows furrowed.

"He could be a spy from Neo Genesis or another organization. We can't trust him."

Mira nodded in agreement.

"The king was last seen heading to the Sunken Islands. There's no threat there to him."

Azriel shrugged. What they said was true, and anyone else would have taken their advice. But Azriel knew more about this situation than they did—at least, he hoped so.

He wasn't sure anymore if the future would follow the same path. But he could only hope that this was one of the few things that hadn't changed.

"I'm not saying we should trust them blindly," Azriel said.

"But we should investigate. If there's even the slightest chance my father is in danger, we can't ignore it. I suggest we bring Lumine and Yelena back to EASC for further investigation."

Lumine and Yelena's eyes widened in shock, but they remained silent, not daring to protest. They had entered this tent knowing they'd relinquished the right to object.

Mira and Amaya exchanged a glance before Mira smiled proudly, and Amaya gave a helpless sigh, resting her hand against her cheek.

"If that's what you wish, my prince, I'll follow your orders."

Azriel turned to Jasmine.

"Unless you're against it?"

Jasmine blinked, her expression unreadable, before she sighed and shook her head.

"This isn't the time or place to argue. We'll follow your suggestion and return to EASC with them."

She looked at Lumine and Yelena.

"But if either of you is lying, not even the academy will protect you."

Both Lumine and Yelena gulped, nodding frantically under her icy glare.

The group moved in silence, exiting the tent and heading towards the helicopters that would take them to EASC.

The air was thick with tension, and Azriel's thoughts raced.

'Fuck...'

His fingers grew cold as the realization hit him—he had to explain to Aeliana that he was going to the void realm.

Sneaking away in secret wasn't an option.

He couldn't bring himself to betray his family like that; they would undoubtedly find out.

But even with that weighing on his mind, one thing was clear: he wasn't about to let Jasmine go alone.

There was no way he could stay behind, not with the chance that his father might be in real danger.

Who knew what could happen?

The situation with Joaquin wasn't as safe as Azriel had originally believed, and doing nothing felt like too big a risk.

Even if his father was powerful enough to survive, something had clearly shifted with Azriel's actions.

It was better to be cautious, better to be prepared.

Plus, the void realm wasn't just a place of danger—it was an opportunity.

The sunken islands, although treacherous, were also valuable, a place where he could grow stronger.

The thought of his father, trapped, only reinforced his determination to act.

Yet, none of that mattered unless he could convince his mother.

Aeliana would be furious.

He knew the conversation would be difficult, but if he played it right, if he made her see the necessity of it, maybe—just maybe—he could get her approval.

As they approached the helicopters, the steady hum of the engines drowned out Azriel's thoughts.

Soldiers of the Crimson Clan, dressed in their dark scarlet uniforms, stood at attention, their backs straight as they waited.

'Ah, I really wanted to take a break…'

Azriel thought, a sigh escaping him.

It seemed this one-week break from the academy wasn't going to be a time for him to relax after all.

Chapter 122: Reflection

"Are you sure you didn't want to say goodbye to the prince and princess, Your Highness?"

Inside the helicopter, soaring toward NASC, Grandmaster Thomas glanced at Celestina, who sat across from him, gazing out of the window.

Her expression was unreadable, her posture calm.

Celestina's lips curled slightly as she turned to face him.

"There's no need for goodbyes. I'll see them again next week."

Thomas studied her for a moment before nodding.

"If that is what you wish."

Celestina shifted her gaze back outside, her mind elsewhere, while Thomas couldn't help but think, his thoughts growing more tangled by the second.

'Should I tell her now, or wait until we meet His Majesty?'

The situation weighed heavily on him—the man in black, who turned out to be a skinwalker during his encounter with Nol.

This was critical information, not just for Neo Genesis, but for the fact that a skinwalker was roaming in Asia.

Yet he had to remain silent, at least until they left CASC, which was already teetering on the edge of panic.

The Frost Clan incident, related to skinwalkers seven years ago, loomed large in his mind.

Telling Ragnar and Celestina would be no small task.

If there was one thing he knew, it was how much they loathed void creatures.

And the ones they hated the most?

Skinwalkers.

The very beings responsible for the deaths of Ragnar's parents, Celestina's grandparents—the previous Frost King and Queen.

'Maybe it's better if I tell her now,' Thomas thought, feeling the weight of the decision.

'She might help me calm His Majesty down.'

He nodded to himself, having made up his mind.

"Your Highness," Thomas called out again, his voice measured.

Celestina turned, curiosity flickering in her eyes.

"What is it, Uncle Thomas?"

He hesitated, then spoke softly.

"There's something I need to tell you. Last night, Sir Nol and I had a meeting with someone from Neo Genesis…"

"...."

Her gaze didn't waver, but her silence pressed him to continue.

"That person wasn't human. It was a skinwalker."

"...."

Again, no reaction from her.

She remained expressionless, watching him in that unnerving quiet.

Thomas took a breath.

"I judged the situation too dangerous to apprehend the skinwalker…"

Still, no response.

The only sound in the cabin was the steady hum of the helicopter's engine.

Seconds passed, stretching into a full minute of silence.

Then, finally, Celestina spoke, her voice level and without any trace of emotion.

"So, a skinwalker is working with a terrorist organization. With humans?"

Thomas nodded slowly, noting how her tone wasn't cold, but neither did it hold warmth.

'She's not going to get angry?'

Thomas thought, relieved by her composure.
