If only Ragnar could react the same way…

"When we reach home, I want you to personally train me, Uncle Thomas."

Her words caught him off guard. His eyes widened in surprise.

"Train you?"

"Compared to the other great children, I'm dead last now. Azriel's surpassed that purple idiot, so I need to surpass him just to get back in the race with the Crimson siblings. And that's just in strength. As for achievements? Azriel's done something that's placed him right beside the Dusk Prince at the top. And me?

I've barely achieved enough to stay a few steps ahead of that purple idiot."

Thomas almost winced at the way Celestina referred to Caleus, but he said nothing.

The relationship between the two was strained, to say the least.

It was far from the friendship she shared with Jasmine.

Surprisingly, Caleus seemed closest to the Dusk Prince and Azriel these days.

'So, she's setting aside the skinwalker problem for now… Good.'

Eventually, Thomas spoke, barely able to contain his excitement.

"If that's what you wish, Your Highness, it would be an honor to train you personally. But I warn you, I won't go easy."

Celestina's lips twitched into a faint smile.

"I'd be upset if you did, Uncle Thomas."

Then, as if remembering something, her tone dropped slightly.

"I also want your help with training my [Unique Skill]."

Thomas' smile froze, his expression shifting to one of surprise.

"…Are you certain about that?"

Without hesitation, Celestina nodded.

"I am."

Thomas stared at her, words failing him as memories surfaced.

'To think she would use it again...'

It had been seven years since Celestina last used her [Unique Skill].

*****

Azriel sat in one of the chairs, his arm resting on the armrest, propping his head on his hand.

His fingers pressed lightly against his cheek, his gaze distant.

To his right, Jasmine sat quietly in another chair, her eyes closed, her posture straight and dignified.

She barely moved, as though deep in thought.

A little behind Azriel's chair, on his left, stood Amaya.

On his right, between him and Jasmine, was Nol, standing with his arms crossed, his face a mask of displeasure.

Yelena and Lumine stood off to the side, near the beautifully adorned wall, their nerves evident in the stiffness of their posture.

In front of Azriel was a desk, with a luxurious chair sitting behind it.

The room they occupied was one of the many lavish chambers inside the Crimson Mansion.

They had come here immediately after arriving at EASC.

Though Azriel longed for rest, there had been no time for it.

Mira had rushed ahead to meet with Aeliana, informing her of everything that had transpired.

Azriel and Jasmine had yet to meet their mother. They were waiting. Lumine and Yelena, on the other hand, stood nervously, too tense to appreciate their surroundings.

Azriel let out a quiet sigh, glancing at Nol, who stood with his eyes closed, a deep frown etched across his face.

'It wasn't such a bad name...'

Azriel thought, amused by Nol's distaste for his new title: the Silver-Blood Devil.

Not sure how to lighten Nol's mood, Azriel let him sulk in silence.

He shifted his gaze to the left, meeting Amaya's eyes.

She smiled faintly, and he returned it, though his smile was a little strained.

'She's been watching my every move...'

Ever since their reunion, it felt like Amaya's eyes never left him.

Not that he blamed her.

She had been caught up in everything surrounding Azriel, from his victory against Neo Genesis to his recklessness in battle.

To her, he must seem like someone who threw himself into danger without a second thought.

'I suppose it fits the image of someone who survived the Void Realm," he mused.

'Someone who no longer feared death.'

But the truth was, fear hadn't left Azriel entirely.

It was simply harder to feel, knowing he had his [Unique Skill] to protect him.

The only thing he truly feared was using it.

The last thing he ever wanted to do was activate [Redo].

Azriel closed his eyes, settling back in his chair.

'If I'm going to think this through, this is as good a time as any.'

His thoughts drifted back to the tunnels. To what he had seen.

Himself.

'That person... it was me. But older, more mature. And he wielded a scythe instead of Void Eater. He killed that pest in my head so effortlessly and left behind just one message: 'Remember.''

Azriel wasn't foolish enough not to understand who that person was.

But accepting it?

That was harder.

In the end, though, he had no choice.

That person...

'He was my future self.'

Or something like that.

There was no other explanation.

Seeing him raised so many questions, questions Azriel had no way of answering.

At least, not yet.

The one thing he did know was what the message meant.

'My missing memories...'

Azriel's mood darkened.

From what Nol had told him, he had already been in this world two years ago, right when the previous Azriel had died.

Then, he inexplicably ended up in White Haven, barely revealing anything to Nol before disappearing again.

'It doesn't make sense. I was badly injured then. Was it when I was still an Awakened, or had I already reached Intermediate? How did I even get there, and what happened after I left?'

Before his previous self died, Azriel had been at the Awakened rank.

But had he ranked up on his own?

Or had the God of Death done something to him?

'How am I supposed to remember?'

His face darkened further.

He had tried before, countless times, but every attempt was met with a fog, blocking his way.

The moment he pushed, a searing headache would force him to stop.

'In the first place, how did I even come to this world? Why?'

Was it truly pity from the God of Death?

That seemed unlikely.

The God of Death was supposed to be fictional, a character in a book.

There weren't ten gods in his previous world, so why now?

Azriel frowned, feeling his thoughts spinning in circles.

'I need to find a way to access my memories...'

The only one in this world who might have any real insight was the Crying Fog.

That titan would undoubtedly come for him eventually.

But then again...

'The bastard in my head couldn't get to those memories. Does that mean the same will happen if I try?'

Azriel let out a long breath just as the door behind him opened.

He turned his head, spotting two figures entering the room.

One was Mira.

And the other...

His mother.

Chapter 123: Frustration

The moment Aeliana entered the room, everyone straightened their backs.

All except for Azriel and Jasmine greeted the Crimson Queen with a bow of their heads and a thump of their right fists.

Mira was the last to enter, quietly closing the wooden door behind them.

Without so much as a glance at her two children, Aeliana walked past them toward her desk.

She wore a deep scarlet dress, the fabric flowing effortlessly with each step, complementing the fiery red of her eyes.

It draped over her frame with an almost otherworldly grace, adding to the presence she already exuded.

Azriel watched silently, pursing his lips as his mother sat down behind the desk.

She crossed her legs, her eyes sweeping over everyone in the room without a trace of emotion.

Lumine and Yelena shivered as they met her gaze.

When her eyes finally landed on Azriel, she narrowed them, carefully assessing his condition.

After a moment, she closed them again and shifted her attention back to Lumine and Yelena.

"Lady Mira has already informed me of the situation. Tell me, Cadet Lumine, Cadet Yelena, how did the two of you come across such classified information so quickly?"

Aeliana spoke in a tone devoid of warmth, her voice carrying the weight of command.

Azriel and Jasmine both furrowed their brows slightly at Aeliana's words.

'So it's true... Father really is at the Sunken Islands.'

Glancing at Lumine and Yelena, Azriel saw they were unable to respond, their nerves seemingly locking their throats.

Azriel sighed inwardly.

He couldn't blame them—his mother's presence was overwhelming.

He, on the other hand, had lived his whole life around such figures, and he barely felt it anymore.

"That's because of Lumine's [unique skill]. It's similar to what a seer might possess, but different," Azriel said calmly, answering for them both.

All heads turned to him.

Aeliana raised an eyebrow, though her face quickly returned to its usual unreadable expression.

'It's better if I speak for them…'

Azriel knew Lumine might accidentally reveal more than necessary, especially with how overwhelmed Yelena seemed.

"Setting aside how he learned about Father, does this mean you don't deny he's in danger?"

Azriel steered the conversation toward the subject that he, Jasmine, and the others were undoubtedly most concerned about.

Aeliana stared at him for a moment before sighing softly.

She nodded, though only slightly.

"'Danger' is a heavy word to use, but at the very least, we've lost all communication with him and his team as of yesterday."

"Where was he last seen?"

Jasmine asked, her face unchanged, though Azriel detected the impatience and worry she was hiding.

"The Sunken Islands."

When Aeliana revealed this, the atmosphere shifted.

Almost everyone's face fell, their expressions darkening.

"So he made it there before we lost him…" Amaya murmured, standing beside Azriel.

Azriel glanced around, noticing the tension weighing on the room.

His eyes met Aeliana's once more, and they held each other's gaze.

She narrowed her eyes, seemingly puzzled by how calm Azriel appeared.

'This is going to be troublesome...'

It wasn't what his mother might think of him right now that troubled him.

It was what Azriel knew—things that none of the others in the room had even an inkling of.

Unlike the rest, Azriel had more knowledge about the Void Realm than they could imagine.

During his time as Leo, he had obsessed over learning everything he could about this world.

And that was why Mira and Amaya looked so concerned.

'Nothing is known about the Sunken Islands…'

Just like in the books.

Unfortunately, the Sunken Islands weren't well-documented.

And worse, they were a no-rift zone.

Joaquin, despite being a Grade 3 Saint, wouldn't be able to open a Void Rift to return.

Azriel shook his head slightly.

'I can't rely on what I know from the book anymore. Who knows what's changed?'

Lost in thought, Azriel barely noticed the look his mother gave him. Jasmine spoke again, her voice steady.

"I'll go."

The room fell silent as everyone looked at Jasmine, their surprise evident.

Aeliana's expression became unreadable as she regarded her daughter.

"I need privacy with my daughter. The rest of you may leave. We'll discuss our next course of action soon."

Everyone began to move, nodding in acknowledgment.

Azriel stood up, glancing at Nol and Amaya, who had already left.

'So, I should leave as well, I suppose?'

Before he could follow, Aeliana's voice stopped him.

"You stay."

His lips twitched into a bitter smile as he sat back down.

'Never mind.'

When the door closed, Aeliana's demeanor softened considerably.

She stood and walked around her desk, her expression betraying the worry she felt for her children.

"Are you both injured?" she asked, her voice softer than before.

Jasmine shook her head.

"No, I'm fine. So is Azriel… now, after the healer came."

Both turned to look at Azriel, who tried to avoid their gazes, pretending he hadn't noticed.

"Azriel."

"Y-yes, Mother?"

Stiffly, he turned to face her. She was watching him intently.

"How is your hand?"

To his surprise, her tone was filled with concern as she glanced at his right hand.

Azriel sighed, relieved, before offering her a reassuring smile.

"It's fine. Good as new, really. You don't have to worry."

She hesitated but eventually nodded, leaning against the desk as she turned her attention back to Jasmine.

"There's a lot I want to say, but it seems we're in difficult circumstances these past few days. You said you wanted to go and save your father. You understand how dangerous it is, right?"

Jasmine nodded firmly. She had visited the Void Realm only a few times, and never outside the human-conquered zones, but her resolve didn't waver.

"The Sunken Islands are something all four clans desire to capture. With everyone focused on the incident at CASC, this is the best opportunity. I could go without attracting attention. Sending a trustworthy team with multiple masters or above would take too much time, and word would spread. It's best if I do this quickly."

The danger of the Sunken Islands lay in its mystery.

But nothing notably dangerous had been discovered in recent years, which only added to its risk.

Aeliana sighed.

"You know the consequences if something happens to you?"

Jasmine nodded again.

"I can handle it."

After a moment, Aeliana nodded in return.

"Give me time to think."

Jasmine smiled slightly.

"Thank you, Mom."

Aeliana returned the smile, then turned her gaze to Azriel.

"Now, my daughter, your little brother and I have some things to discuss."

'Fuck...'

Azriel glanced at Jasmine, who smirked at him before walking out, leaving him alone with their mother.

The door closed behind her with a quiet thud.

"What were you thinking?"

Azriel tried to smile softly, but Aeliana's sharp tone made it difficult.

"...To get some sleep and food?" he responded.

Aeliana's lips twitched.

"You think this is funny, Azriel? Do you even realize what you've done?"

Azriel's faint smile vanished as he nodded, his expression turning serious.

"Of course I do. You think I'd do something like this without reason?"

"...Why?"

Her question caught him off guard, and Azriel hesitated as Aeliana continued.

"What reason could possibly justify getting involved with terrorists? Terrorists with saints in their ranks. You fought one of those saints, nearly losing your life multiple times—do you even understand how reckless that was?"

Azriel's eyes met his mother's, her voice laced with concern. She wasn't angry, she was afraid for him.

"I needed to achieve something, to stand on equal ground with the others," he finally said.

Aeliana raised an eyebrow, skeptical.

"You expect me to believe that? You—who doesn't even want to be king and has handed the throne to your sister without a second thought. I can't tell what it is you want. You've hidden everything so well, played it all so perfectly. How long did it take to achieve this victory?

How could you look so calm, so collected, knowing that every moment could've been your last, that one mistake would have cost you everything?"

Azriel's expression darkened as his mother's words cut deep.

"There was a time," she continued, "when I wished you would put in the same effort as the other children. But now... I think I'm starting to regret ever wishing that."

'Don't...'

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Azriel's hand gripped the armrest of the chair so tightly it began to splinter. His jaw clenched as he stared at her, trying to keep himself composed.

He had tried. But her words struck a nerve, pulling at memories he had buried deep, things he had vowed never to let resurface.

Before he could stop himself, his voice came out cold, almost unrecognizable.

"Then what is it you want from me?"

"Azriel...?"

Aeliana's eyes widened at the sudden change in his demeanor.

Azriel froze, her concerned tone pulling him back to himself. His own eyes widened in shock as he realized what he had just done. He quickly forced himself to calm down.

"...Sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you like that."

But his apology only deepened her worry.

"Don't hold back. If you have something to say, then say it."

Since he was a child, Azriel had always been difficult to read.

He rarely opened up, never let anyone see too deep inside—not even his own mother could truly understand what went on in his mind most of the time.

So, if there was a chance to break through that wall, she wasn't going to let it slip away.

But Azriel just shook his head.

"I just lost control for a moment... I'm sorry. Can we continue?"

"No."

As stubborn as Azriel was, his mother was more so.

"If you're angry, then shout. If you're sad, cry. If you're happy, laugh. I don't want my son bottling up his emotions. Believe me, I did that for two years, and it broke me in ways you can't imagine. I was lucky—I managed to piece myself back together before things got worse."

Azriel remained silent, her words sinking into him like stones. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white, but his thoughts were a mess, tangled in frustration and guilt.

He opened his mouth to speak... but nothing came out. His mind screamed for an answer, but the words wouldn't form.

His face twisted in pain and frustration. He wanted to say something—anything. But all that came was a single word, whispered through his cracked voice.

"...Dammit."

Chapter 124: The Void Capitals

A knock echoed through the room just as Azriel's words reached Aeliana's ears.

Annoyed, she shot a cold glance toward the door.

Whoever it was had just ruined her chance to finally get her son to speak to her properly.

She had been so close.

She could feel it.

A little more, and Azriel might have said something important.

'At least I know he's hiding more than he shows...' she thought with an inward sigh.

She had to settle for that, for now.

"Come in," she said, attempting to mask her frustration as the door opened.

Surprisingly, it was her daughter and Mira who entered.

They exchanged hesitant glances, sensing the heavy atmosphere between Aeliana and Azriel.

"Did something happen?"

Aeliana broke the silence first, not wanting the two to catch on to what was happening.

Mira nodded, bowing slightly.

"A report just came in from SICVC. They've already sent a rescue team towards the king's location, but..."

She hesitated before continuing, her voice uneasy.

"We've lost all contact with them. The last thing heard were their screams. It's believed they're dead."

Aeliana pressed her lips together, suppressing a flicker of dread.

"Make sure news of the king being trapped doesn't leave SICVC. Anyone there stays there."

Mira bowed again.

"I've already done so, my queen."

"What was the rescue team composed of?"

Aeliana asked, her voice low.

Mira responded without delay.

"A single master, two experts, five advanced, six intermediates, and ten awakened."

Aeliana furrowed her brow.

'They all died just like that...?'

It was a heavy loss.

The number of humans in the Void Realm was limited, and losing even a single master was devastating, let alone the others.

The number of masters on Earth wasn't many to begin with.

Most didn't have the talent to become one, and those who tried by hunting void creatures often didn't survive.

Every potential hero mattered.

Undoubtedly, SICVC and Earth had taken a critical hit with this loss.

SICVC—Sunken Islands Crimson Void Capital—was one of the conquered territories in the Void Realm, claimed by the Crimson Clan.

Though the Void Capital wasn't in the actual Sunken Islands, it was close enough to be named after the mysterious place.

Each of the four great clans had their own Void Capital, and a known landmark in the Void Realm was usually where one was built.

The flags of either the Crimson, Nebula, Frost, or Dusk clans marked them.

Currently, the Crimson and Dusk clans controlled the most Void Capitals.

'Should this stay a secret?'

Aeliana wondered, her gaze drifting to her daughter.

Initially, she didn't mind if Jasmine went on the rescue mission.

The team was to be led by Mira, a grade-3 grandmaster, and Amaya, a grade-3 master, with Crimson soldiers supporting them.

It would be valuable experience for Jasmine as the future queen.

And Aeliana had doubted her husband was truly in danger—he would've returned by now if not.

But he hadn't.

Which meant something was keeping him there.

Aeliana scowled as her mind raced.

'If Mira goes, it might make a difference...'

But was it safe?

What exactly was keeping her husband trapped?

Suddenly, Azriel spoke, his voice breaking through the tense atmosphere.

"You're right, Lady Mira. They're dead."

All heads snapped to him.

Azriel stood there, a slight smile playing on his lips.

His earlier grim expression had vanished.

The women exchanged confused looks, and Azriel elaborated.

"There are only two ways to reach the Sunken Islands: by air or by water. The first option's useless since you'll eventually have to go underwater. The second one is the real way, but also the most dangerous. After all, we know that water and void creatures are a deadly combination."

He was right.

The oceans were teeming with void creatures, and battling them in water was one of humanity's greatest disadvantages.

Aeliana blinked.

"How do you know that?"

Azriel had never shown an interest in studying the Void Realm.

Even though it was an optional lesson, he had avoided it.

So why was he so confident now?

Azriel's smile widened.

"How else? I've already been there."

"...!"

Everyone's eyes widened in shock.

'What...! He was so close to one of our Void Capitals!?'

Aeliana was in disbelief.

But it was possible.

SICVC was different from other Void Capitals. It was isolated, surrounded by unconquered territories. There was a slim, almost impossible chance that Azriel had been near it.

But then... why hadn't he gone all the way?

As if reading her thoughts, Azriel continued,

"The Sunken Islands are underwater, in the middle of an endless sea. It separated the place where I was from the Void Capital—unless I crossed it, of course."

Hearing his words, Aeliana felt her heart clench as everyone else's faces darkened.

Azriel, however, remained unbothered, still smiling.

'How must it have felt... to be so close to home but unable to return...?'

All because of a sea that could've killed him.

It hurt.

Aeliana realized just how close her son had once been to returning.

But he couldn't.

His eyes seemed distant, as if recalling those moments vividly.

Aeliana bit her lip, unable to comfort him.

'I shouldn't have scolded him earlier...'

Perhaps there had been a better way to talk to him.

Then Azriel looked at her and the others.

"What I'm trying to say is that it's a void creature—specifically one that rules that part of the sea—attacked the rescue team. It might've destroyed dad's way back to the Void Capital too."

A crooked smile tugged at his lips as he added,

"I personally named that annoying bastard Tarshakael."

"Tarshakael..." Mira repeated cautiously, an ominous feeling washing over the room.

"How strong is it?"

Azriel's next words confirmed why they felt that way.

"I didn't get close last time, but I almost lost my life. From what I gathered, I'd say it's a Titan."

Aeliana sucked in a sharp breath, not at the mention of a Titan, but at the thought of her son nearly dying because of one.

Perhaps sensing her worry, Azriel gave her a gentle smile.

"Don't worry, Mom. Titans love me. In fact, one's crying to meet me right now!"

Those words... did he realize they weren't reassuring in the slightest?

Azriel didn't seem to notice her worsening mood.

"We're going to have a talk about that later..." Aeliana muttered darkly, making Azriel stiffen.

Her eyes narrowed.

'Why is a Titan hunting him?'

She was certain he wasn't lying this time.

Azriel cleared his throat, regaining their attention.

"Well, besides that, there is a way to avoid fighting Tarshakael."

Jasmine blinked at him.

"Go on."

Azriel's lips twitched.

"Can't sleep, can't eat, can't have fun, huh... Well, you can face Tarshakael and other Void creatures that survived under his rule. But, Mira, I doubt you'll stand much of a chance alone. The grandmaster at SICVC must also stay put, so…"

Aeliana's gaze locked onto him as he said softly,

He turned to Aeliana, his voice steady.

"Let me go as well."

The room fell silent as Aeliana's heart stopped.

For a brief moment, she could only stare at her son before her temper flared.

"Absolutely not."

Her voice was firm, commanding. No one dared argue with her.

Except Azriel.

His lips curved up as he responded, equally soft.

"Mom, I've already been there. I know how to avoid Tarshakael. I can handle myself. You don't want anything to happen to Jasmine, and we don't even know if Dad's safe. The longer we wait, the worse things might get."

Aeliana's hands clenched into fists as she fought to keep her emotions in check.

Her son had already survived the horrors of that place once.

How could she send him back?

"...I can't send both my children into that nightmare," she said, her voice trembling.

"Not after what you've been through."

Azriel took a step forward, shaking his head.

"You're not forcing me this time, Mom. I'm going willingly. Trust me, I know what I'm doing."

His tone carried a certainty that made Aeliana hesitate, wondering if he was really just an intermediate.

No.

He was a prince. She reminded herself of that fact, calming her nerves, if only a little.

"I may not have entered the Sunken Islands myself, but I know its waters. I know how to get to the middle at least. And I definitely know how to avoid Tarshakael. Let me go, and I promise I'll bring back both Dad and Jasmine safely."

Aeliana studied him in silence, torn between her instincts as a mother and the faith she had in her son.

Finally, she let out a bitter smile.

'Even now... I'm still a pathetic mother.'

"Fine. You have one week. If you're not back by then, I'll send every saint on Earth after you. I don't care if you need an extra hour or even a day."

Azriel's face lit up with a smile, but it only made Aeliana squint suspiciously.

'Is he really so eager to return to the place where he spent two years?'

Jasmine and Mira exchanged uneasy glances.

Neither of them seemed on board with the idea of Azriel going back.

Yet, it was undeniable—if anyone knew how to navigate past a titan without fighting, it would be him.

And maybe, just maybe, it was the safest option after all, despite the risks.

Humans had always taken risks.

Especially Azriel, given the feats he had already accomplished in the void dungeon.

"You don't need to worry," Azriel reassured them.

"I'll be back before the academy starts again. Oh, and one more thing..."

Aeliana felt a twinge of regret, already sensing that his next request would test her patience.

"What is it?"

She really wished she hadn't asked.

"I want Nol, Lumine, and Yelena to come with us."

Chapter 125: SICVC [1]

The backyard of the Crimson Estate stretched wide under the cracked sky.

Oaks and towering pines bordered the grounds, their branches swaying gently in the wind, casting long shadows over the perfectly manicured lawn.

The grass was a deep, rich green, untouched by wild overgrowth. In the center stood a marble fountain, water flowing in smooth arcs, the steady sound adding a sense of calm.

Rows of crimson roses lined the edges of the garden.

And standing there in the same backyard were three people—Lumine, Yelena, and Mira.

Lumine and Yelena wore crimson military uniforms, surprisingly similar to Mira's.

The only difference was that they didn't have the black furred coat draped over their shoulders.

Both stood with their backs straight, clearly nervous in the presence of a grandmaster.

Lumine glanced at the grass, noticing how the blades seemed to lean toward Mira, as if drawn by her mere presence.

Even the trees, swayed by the wind, bent slightly in her direction.

'A grandmaster—someone no longer considered human… almost like a god.'

Her presence was overwhelming, even though she wasn't doing anything.

Just standing near her felt suffocating, making Lumine fight the urge to lower his gaze.

He glanced at Yelena, and their eyes met.

She gave him a small, wry smile.

"You must be extremely talented, Cadet Lumine, to rank above the Frost Princess and place second. And you too, Cadet Yelena, ranked sixth in your first year. Both of you have achieved feats you should be proud of. Word of how you protected the cadets from the skeleton stampede is already spreading."

It seemed Mira had decided to see them as highly talented rather than mere survivors of void creature battles.

Of course, that made sense.

Anyone looking into their records wouldn't find any official reports of them fighting void creatures.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged surprised glances as they noticed a faint smile tugging at Mira's lips, despite her usual stoic expression.

"Y-you… you know about us?" Lumine asked.

Mira nodded without hesitation.

"All the higher-ups know about you. Whether you realize it or not, both of you have the potential to be one of the great pillars supporting humanity's future. Your names are already well-known."

Lumine swallowed nervously.

'I had no idea we were being watched by such big names already...'

Though, on second thought, it wasn't too surprising.

Hero Academy was known for producing the best cadets, and the top ten of the first year were bound to draw attention.

"And..."

Mira's eyes narrowed slightly, or at least it felt like that to Lumine.

It was as if thousands of needles pricked his skin, drying his lips.

"It's only natural I'd find out everything about you two, especially since the prince went against the queen's wishes to have both of you join us."

Lumine blinked, startled, and looked at Yelena.

She shook her head slightly, just as confused.

'He did that? But why?'

Lumine couldn't make sense of it.

Even back in CASC, Azriel had supported him for reasons he didn't fully understand.

He never looked at him like he was crazy or dangerous.

'Is he really that good of a person? Or is there another reason?'

Doubts started to form in his mind.

"The prince has never been one to get close to others, not since he was young. So, it's surprising that he's protecting the two of you so much," Mira remarked, suspicion flickering in her eyes.

Lumine didn't have any answers.

He didn't understand why Azriel had helped them either. He was an enigma—so much about him didn't add up.

Yelena furrowed her brow slightly.

"Did Prince Azriel not have any friends? Is that why he isn't close to many people?"

Mira looked at her for a moment before sighing.

"If you were royalty, you'd know how difficult it is to form true friendships. People use you for their own purposes. But no, that's not the reason. No one really knows why the prince distanced himself. That's how rumors started."

'The unworthy prince...'

It was the label most had given him. They saw him as a prince without talent, without strength. A prince who couldn't achieve anything.

At least, that was until he came back from the dead.

"Whatever the case, unlike the two of you, no one will take the prince's words lightly once we enter SICVC. It's not just because he's royalty. Surviving two whole years in the void realm—alone—is enough to command respect. Being a prince is just an added bonus."

She looked at Lumine and Yelena with an intensity that made Lumine feel like he couldn't look away.

"Once you enter the void realm, your age won't matter anymore. No one will see you as children. You'll be adults from that point on—if you survive. So do your best to show why the prince was so determined to have the two of you with us. Prove that you belong."

Lumine felt a chill run through his fingers.

'The void realm...'

It was still hard to believe they were actually going there now.

Sure, he and Yelena had been there before, but that was only because of the system's quests.

The places they had gone were just random areas with void creatures to fight.

But this time... this time was different.

He was going to face the real horrors of the void realm.

They would become adults.

Age wouldn't matter anymore.

No one would see them as children.

Lumine released a quiet, shaky breath, while Yelena glanced down, clearly nervous.

Though they had already decided to go, the weight of that decision was still heavy.

Suddenly, something caught Lumine's eye—one of the walls in the backyard.

It looked dented.

A human-shaped dent.

'Did someone crash there?'

His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him.

Mira stopped looking at the two and bowed, thumping her right fist against her chest.

"My prince."

Startled, Lumine and Yelena turned to see Azriel approaching, a small smile on his face.

Like them, he wore the crimson military uniform, but his was adorned with a black furred coat, just like Mira's.

Walking behind him on his left was Amaya, and on his right was Nol, though only Amaya had a black furred coat—Nol looked disappointed to be left out.

Azriel stopped in front of them and glanced around briefly before meeting Mira's eyes.

"Lady Mira, has my sister not arrived yet?"

Mira shook her head.

"Her Highness should be here any moment, my prince."

Azriel furrowed his brows slightly.

"Well, girls do tend to take their time with makeup..."

Lumine and Yelena blinked at his comment, a hint of red creeping onto Yelena's face as she looked down again.

'He really acts like it's no big deal...'

Lumine thought, watching Azriel's calm demeanor.

Their eyes met, and Azriel's smile faded as he spoke in a more serious tone.

"Have you written the letters?"

Yelena looked up, her expression complicated, while Lumine bit his lip. Both nodded.

"Yes," Lumine said.

"We gave them to one of the maids, as you requested."

Azriel nodded, and the atmosphere grew solemn.

The letters were for their parents, a precaution Azriel had insisted on before they entered the void realm.

They were still children here, not yet in the void realm, but parents would always see their children as just that—children.

Azriel wouldn't take them unless they left something behind, should the worst happen.

Lumine clenched his fists.

'I'll make sure those letters never have to reach them...'

Azriel's smile returned, brighter this time, as he placed a hand on both their shoulders.

"Try to relax. Being tense and nervous won't help you. And don't worry—your parents won't need to read those letters. You're going with the Crimson Princess, a grandmaster, a master-ranked maid, a silver-blood devil, and, of course, the best part... me!"

At his words, Nol's face darkened comically, prompting Lumine and Yelena to take a step back in unison.

"My prince, even for you, how many times must I remind you to take things more seriously?"

Amaya scolded from behind, and Mira nodded in agreement.

"Lady Amaya is right, my prince. We're heading somewhere unknown. Anything could happen," Mira added.

Azriel's lips twitched as he glanced between them, still smiling, though his eyes were less amused.

"Have your social skills deteriorated that much?"

Both women widened their eyes, hurriedly apologizing.

'Oh...'

Lumine realized, feeling a tinge of surprise.

'He was just trying to lighten the mood, wasn't he?'

Azriel had likely sensed how on edge everyone was.

Though he wasn't the best at it, he was at least trying to ease the tension.

A small smile appeared on both Lumine's and Yelena's faces.

"Thanks," Lumine muttered.

Azriel glanced at him, smiling softly.

"Of course."

There was so much Lumine wanted to ask, so many things he was curious about, but now wasn't the time.

Perhaps after all of this, he would have a chance.

'This is an invaluable opportunity, and I can't let it go to waste.'

Glancing at Yelena, they both nodded with renewed determination.

Then, a voice came from the side.

"I see everyone is here."

Jasmine had arrived, dressed similarly to Azriel.

"Took you long enough."

Jasmine sighed.

"You're the one who ran from Mother, not me. Anyway, let's not waste time. Lady Mira, you're already anchored at SICVC, so if you would."

"Certainly, Your Highness."

Mira nodded, and everyone took a few steps back.

Then, a white cross appeared beneath Mira's feet.

The wind howled, roaring through the air, furiously whipping their hair as Lumine's breath caught in his throat.

He could feel the mana gathering in one place, pulling toward Mira.

Though he couldn't see it, he could sense it.

His heartbeat quickened.

Lumine squinted. In front of Mira's outstretched hand, a tiny black hole began to form, almost imperceptible at first. But it grew larger. And larger. Until Lumine's face paled.

'She actually created a void rift...'

Right before them was a swirling mass of darkness, a portal that sucked the air, making the grass and trees around them thrash wildly.

Somehow, Lumine knew Mira was protecting them from being pulled in.

Then, she turned toward them.

"Let's go."

Chapter 126: SICVC [2]

Lumine blinked as he found himself in what seemed like a different world—and indeed it was.

He stood in the heart of what appeared to be SICVC.

Towering structures, their stones weathered and cracked, surrounded him.

Ivy and wild roots snaked through the crevices, reclaiming the stonework as nature slowly wove its way back in.

The air was filled with the smell of damp earth and decaying wood.

Soldiers clad in crimson and black uniforms rushed past, as if the entire void capital had been thrown into chaos—and it had.

They moved with urgency, their boots crunching against the dirt floor and sending up small clouds of dust.

It felt as though Lumine had gone back in time, watching everything unfold with almost no sign of technology.

Surrounding the void capital, he couldn't determine its size, but he could see countless trees outside its walls—trees so tall he couldn't tell where they ended.

Yet, he didn't bother to look up, for he knew better.

Never look at something for too long.

The entire capital resembled a ruined city, remnants of a civilization long past.

What was most disturbing, though, was the complete lack of security or safety around him.

'What if void creatures attack? Do these soldiers really just let them come here?'

No barriers or defenses of any sort.

It was ridiculous.

Lumine looked around in disbelief and pity.

"Commander Mira, my prince, my princess, if you would follow me, the others are already waiting for the meeting."

A voice broke through their thoughts—it belonged to a man standing before them.

He had gray hair and a matching beard, his black eyes set deep within wrinkles etched across his face, and he wore a crimson military uniform.

He bowed respectfully to Azriel and Jasmine as he spoke.

They weren't there for sightseeing, so naturally, no one declined or objected.

Mira nodded and took the lead, the rest following closely behind.

Lumine furrowed his brows.

'Is this how every void capital looks?'

If so, he worried for the safety of the people residing there.

Most humans didn't, but some lived in void capitals—primarily the forces attempting to conquer the void realm.

It must be... frightening.

Silence fell over the group as they walked, the atmosphere heavy.

The panic of the soldiers made it impossible to spark a conversation.

The soldier eventually stopped, and everyone else did the same as they arrived in front of a huge black tent.

Two other soldiers stood guard at the entrance—one in black, the other in crimson. The first soldier turned and bowed slightly.

"Unfortunately, I do not have the authority to proceed..."

Finally, for the first time, the old man looked at Nol, Lumine, and Yelena.

"If those three aren't going to join you in the meeting, they can rest in one of the rooms in the building."

But before any of the three could respond, Azriel stepped forward.

"I appreciate your consideration, but these three are with us and will be attending the meeting as well."

The old man studied Azriel for a few seconds before bowing again.

"As you wish, my prince."

With that, he stepped aside, and the soldiers guarding the entrance followed suit, allowing them to enter.

Lumine took a deep breath and followed Mira and the others inside.

"...!"

The moment Lumine stepped inside, he felt every hair on his body stand on end.

Goosebumps prickled his skin as he looked around wide-eyed.

A huge wooden round table dominated the room, and a map lay spread across it, displaying what seemed to be a rough drawing of their surroundings.

But that wasn't what made him alert.

No, it was the men.

The men seated behind the wooden table gazed intently at Lumine and the rest.

Their presence was overwhelming—not just theirs, but also the others standing behind the seated men and women.

All these battle-hardened veterans of the Sunken Islands filled the tent, not holding back as they released their aura.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged glances, their expressions hardening as they tried to collect themselves.

In the next second, the chairs creaked as everyone stood up instantly, bowing and thumping their right fists against their chests in greeting to Azriel and Jasmine.

The aura each person emitted clashed against one another before retracting, as if it had been a mere dream.

Lumine gulped nervously, feeling out of place—like a sheep among wolves.

And if there was a leader among these wolves, it was definitely the man standing at the other side of the wooden table.

He studied them, a grandmaster... just like Mira.

The man had short black hair and wore a crimson military uniform paired with a black fur-lined coat.

In fact, all the seated men and women had similar coats, while those standing did not.

But this man... he was undeniably overwhelming, like Mira.

His right cheek bore a scar, and his left eye was covered by an eyepatch.

A small beard adorned his face, and his physique was leaner than expected.

'This is really crazy...'

For a moment, Lumine's resolve wavered as he contemplated what he had gotten himself into, but he quickly shook his head inwardly.

It was an opportunity—an opportunity to get stronger.

And if by some chance, he might actually meet the Crimson King... he couldn't miss out on such a chance.

"It's good to see you in good health, Grandmaster Amon."

The grandmaster, referred to as Amon, smiled slightly as he spoke, his voice devoid of warmth.

"Commander Mira, it's great to see that Joaquin Red Kitty is doing so well."

Instantly, the air froze. Lumine's face went pale.

'Kitty... he called King Joaquin so casually, and the commander of the Crimson Army his pet!?'

What was more absurd was that this man belonged to the same army!

'Wait, just what is this man's position?'

He felt suffocated.

Amon and Mira stared at each other, the air growing colder as everyone shivered.

Lumine looked at Jasmine, who regarded Amon with a hardened expression, and when he turned to Azriel, he saw a stoic face with lips twitching, trembling, and then...

"Pfft! Hahaha! I never thought I'd hear such a reference in the Void Realm!"

Azriel burst out laughing.

All heads snapped to him, a mix of pure confusion and surprise lighting their faces.

Azriel laughed, trying to suppress his mirth while wiping tears from his eyes.

Then another bellowing laugh echoed through the tent.

Heads turned to Amon, who was grinning widely at Azriel.

"Bwahaha! As expected of you, my prince; I knew you would catch on to that!"

'Huh... reference? A book?'

It seemed like something Lumine couldn't grasp.

No one could—except for the two of them, who must have been referencing some sort of book.

Mira scowled at Amon.

"Insulting me is one thing, but speaking casually of the king is something you can't just do, Grandmaster Amon."

But Amon merely scoffed.

"You and your loyalty. Have you forgotten who taught you how to wield a sword and that crimson brat you swore your life to?"

Lumine's eyes went wide.

'The hell!? How old is he really to have taught King Joaquin and Lady Mira how to wield a sword!?'

Amon looked to be in his late forties at best.

Then Amon exhaled loudly.

"Well, enough of this. Let's all have a seat; we've got a lot to discuss."

No one objected as the seated men and women returned to their chairs.

The empty seats in front of Lumine were taken by Jasmine, with Azriel sitting to her right and Lady Mira to her left.

Amaya occupied a spot to Azriel's right, but Nol stood behind.

Lumine and Yelena exchanged glances, understanding they too had to remain standing instead of taking seats.

They moved to the sides, standing further back for a proper view of everyone, yet close enough to Azriel and Jasmine.

"Grandmaster Amon, you taught my father how to wield a sword, right? Surely you have some interesting stories for my sister and me?"

Azriel and Jasmine looked at Amon, who grinned back at them.

Jasmine showed little emotion, but Lumine noticed the curiosity in her eyes; she too wanted to know.

Amon chuckled darkly.

"Oh, stories? I have plenty from your father... Let's make a deal. I'll share a lifetime's worth of dark stories about your dad, and in return..."

He narrowed his eyes.

"You give me some of your stories about how you survived the Void Realm on your own."

The air instantly grew tense again, and everyone looked uncomfortable between Azriel and Amon.

But Azriel smiled.

"Looks like we have a deal."

Amon laughed again, pleased as he nodded his head.

Jasmine, however, looked at Azriel with her eyebrows slightly furrowed before turning her head away.

Lumine glanced around at the others present and noticed something odd since arriving at the Void Capital: there were two different militaries here—one from the government with their black uniforms and the other from the Crimson Clan in crimson uniforms.

Even some in black were seated at the table.

"Now then, time is of the essence. Let's start properly, shall we?"

Then, as if a switch had been flipped, the air turned cold.

Amon's smile vanished, his face hardening as if his previous laughter and warmth had all been an act.

Lumine was speechless.

It wasn't just him; every single person's expression changed.

The light atmosphere created by Azriel and Amon evaporated instantly.

When Lumine glanced at Azriel, a shiver ran down his spine because he, wore the most indifferent face of all.

Chapter 127: SICVC [3]

Lumine wasn't the only one to notice. Many glanced at the prince, their expressions a mix of surprise and unease.

Those closest to him shifted uncomfortably, while others looked on with curiosity.

It was disturbing.

The way he showed no emotion—his face blank, as if he had none to give.

Not in those crimson eyes.

Not in that face.

To Lumine, it felt unnatural compared to the others.

Yet.

Curiosity flickered across Amon's face for a moment before his expression hardened. He turned his attention to Jasmine, looking at her seriously, ignoring Azriel entirely.

Before Amon could speak, Jasmine's cold voice cut through the tension.

"Before we begin, Grandmaster Amon, why are government officials here, in Crimson territory, and at this meeting?"

"This isn't your barbaric clan's land yet, Your Highness. Not until the Sunken Islands are fully yours. And this isn't much of a Void Capital either, since it still needs to be built and marked by your clan."

A man in a black uniform scowled at Jasmine as he spoke, his bald head gleaming under the dim light. He stared at her fiercely, but she didn't flinch.

Instead, she raised her eyebrows, maintaining her calm.

"Is that so? Well, I understand you government dogs might enjoy sightseeing in our future Void Capital, hiding behind my father's protection while secretly barking behind his back. But why are you at this meeting? Missing your master already?"

Lumine winced at the crude words slipping from Jasmine's lips, yet she looked at the bald man calmly, her mouth curving into a slight smile.

It was as if what she said was completely normal.

'The Crimson Clan and the government don't get along…'

It was something anyone could see.

'Is it like this with every great clan?'

Lumine's face darkened as regret seeped into his thoughts. He'd neglected his opportunities at the academy.

The academy had its vast libraries, filled with knowledge he should've sought out, not to mention the professors and influential figures who were always within reach. He should have learned more.

Hell, one of his friends was a prince, watching all of this unfold with complete detachment.

The bald man's face turned beet red as he clenched his teeth, glaring at Jasmine.

But in the end, he clicked his tongue and shifted his gaze back to Amon, who watched everything without the slightest disturbance.

None of them did anything.

"It is as Sir Cole said, Your Highness. These government officials were here before His Majesty left to explore the Sunken Islands. He gave them permission to stay as long as they wished. The rescue team was made up of their men as well, so it's natural they're in this meeting, considering their losses."

Jasmine nodded at Amon's explanation.

Amon cleared his throat, ensuring he had everyone's attention as he continued.

"As you all know, the king went to explore the Sunken Islands. We've lost all communication with him and the rescue team we sent. We believe a void creature attacked them and killed everyone. As for the king, knowing him, he's likely fine. The only reason he might still be there is if he doesn't know about the communication loss or doesn't care. Or… there's something there keeping him"

Hearing his explanation, Jasmine nodded, while the others looked solemn.

No one worried for Joaquin—at least, that's what they made themselves believe.

After all, if one of the Great Kings was truly in danger, it would mean disaster, especially since he was of the Third Void Generation, the children of the nightmarish Second Void Generation.

It was easier for everyone to convince themselves that Joaquin was simply caught in a complicated situation, but otherwise safe.

"These are all hypotheses," Mira muttered quietly beside Jasmine, to which Amon nodded.

"I would've gone myself, but the king ordered me to stay here. If I left while the Void Capital was still under construction, those bastard creatures waiting for a chance would burn everything to the ground."

Jasmine frowned slightly, while Lumine fought to keep his expression neutral. But deep down, a dark feeling coiled in his chest.

'He's hiding something…'

Amon was being too vague.

"Why did you decide to build SICVC on top of these ruins?" Jasmine asked, her tone skeptical.

Amon hesitated before answering.

"That… was the king's order. I don't have an answer beyond that."

Jasmine sighed, nodding in reluctant understanding.

They all turned their attention to the map spread out in front of them. It was roughly drawn, lacking any significant detail, with three black X's marking key locations.

Lumine assumed the first X represented SICVC, the second the sea, and the last, closer to the middle, marked the location of the Sunken Islands.

"Those three X's—one is where the king is, another where a void creature wiped out the rescue team, and the third is us at SICVC."

Amon stood up, leaning forward with both hands pressed against the table as he studied the map.

He pointed to the first X, then traced toward the middle one.

"The first X is SICVC. The area around us, leading to the sea, has mostly been cleared of void creatures, so it should be relatively safe. But the real problem is reaching the last X—where the Sunken Islands are."

Jasmine's expression darkened.

"The Sunken Islands are underwater. Just crossing those waters is deadly enough, but going beneath them? I doubt many would return."

A mission to reach the Sunken Islands and find the king—but word of it couldn't be allowed to leak to Earth.

And they were limited. Other Grandmasters and Saints were either on dangerous missions of their own, or it would take too long to inform them about another operation involving the Sunken Islands.

The other great clans might not react well to such news either.

It was even a surprise that the government officials hadn't reported the king's involvement yet.

Too many things were being kept secret.

Once again, Lumine couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

'Is all this risk really necessary?'

The cost of human lives… just to keep secrets. Was it really worth it?

Yet again, when Lumine gazed at the figures around him, it seemed as if they didn't even care about the people who had died. No, he couldn't imagine a single person here shedding a tear for any of the fallen.

Jasmine's voice broke the silence.

"There might be a way to reach the Sunken Islands without having to fight the void creatures in the sea."

Amon's eyebrows shot up, intrigued, and he nodded.

"I'm listening, Your Highness."

Jasmine hummed softly, then turned her gaze toward Azriel. As if on cue, the others did the same, but Azriel didn't react. He sat straight, indifferent, his eyes fixed on the map.

Finally, he lifted his gaze, first meeting Jasmine's, then moving over the others before finally settling on Amon.

"Unless we have a saint, or at least two more grandmasters, or a platoon of the most skilled masters alive, crossing the Sunken Sea will kill all of us."

Lumine gulped, a shiver running down his spine. Azriel's voice... it was unsettlingly calm, devoid of warmth or cold. It made him feel something—a sense of discomfort he couldn't quite explain.

"And why is that, my prince?" Amon asked, his expression unchanged, though his eyes sharpened as they locked onto Azriel.

Azriel met his gaze without flinching.

"Because I've been to the other side of the Sunken Sea, and I've seen the ruler of those waters."

Shock rippled through the room, but Amon remained composed, nodding for Azriel to continue.

"Go on, my prince."

To Lumine, it seemed as if Amon didn't even care that Azriel had already been there once.

"A specific void creature dwells in the Sunken Sea. Its name is Tarshakael. I believe it's a titan-ranked void creature, which explains why our entire rescue team was wiped out and why my father's team may be unable to return. To reach the Sunken Islands, you'd need to get past him, which none of us can do—except perhaps my father. Or, if you, Grandmaster Amon, and Commander Mira worked together, you might have a chance. But the risks are too great, and we can't afford them."

Azriel continued, his tone steady, as the others listened intently.

"When I was on the other side, I discovered a passage that led to an underground network. Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough to explore it fully, but I believe it eventually leads to the Sunken Islands. It's likely near the sea—we just have to find another passage on this side and follow the path."

For the first time, Amon's expression shifted, clearly surprised. The others looked equally stunned.

"We haven't uncovered much about the Sunken Sea, but... it's plausible that there's an underground network leading to the Sunken Islands," Someone else said.

Azriel nodded.

"I'm certain there's a passage. We could attempt to go around the sea, but that would mean crossing the mountains—just as dangerous, if not more so, since that area remains unexplored."

It was Mira who broke the silence, her voice tinged with suspicion.

"Aren't we overlooking something important?"

Amon and the others turned to her, while Azriel gazed at her without emotion.

"Why can't the king just open a void rift? Sure, it would cost him a significant amount of mana, destroy his anchor here in SICVC, and require transporting others, but his other anchor on Earth is still intact in EASC."

A tense silence followed. It was a valid question—one Lumine had also wondered about. It should have been the first thing asked, yet it felt as though it had been deliberately avoided.

Amon sighed, his expression darkening as he addressed Mira.

"What was once a theory is now believed to be fact—there's something in the Sunken Islands interfering with the creation of void rifts. It's impossible to open one there or place an anchor."

Mira's eyes widened, as did those of several others, including Jasmine.

'A void rift can't be opened…?'

It was absurd. The mere thought of it was inconceivable. For a grandmaster, the ability to open void rifts was one of their defining powers.

But now, Amon was telling them a grandmaster couldn't do that in the Sunken Islands.

Jasmine broke the silence again.

"Grandmaster Amon, we have seven days until the higher-ups learn of what's happening. I'll personally lead a special team through the underground tunnels to meet my father. Best case, we'll have conquered the islands by then."

Her words, under normal circumstances, would have sounded ridiculous.

But here, they didn't.

In fact, it seemed entirely possible that Joaquin had already conquered the strange underwater islands.

And if not, their chances of success would greatly increase with Jasmine leading the charge, along with Mira and Amaya.

Lumine had expected someone to object, but instead, Amon simply nodded.

"Certainly, Your Highness. I'll send my best men to accompany you. Of course, those who came with you can stay or leave as they wish."

Lumine furrowed his brows.

'Why is everyone so... calm?'

In contrast to the panicked soldiers outside, everyone here seemed to be treating the situation far too lightly.

The constant shifts in tone were giving him a headache.

'Are all influential people this strange?'

It certainly seemed that way.

Suddenly, Azriel stood up, his voice flat and emotionless as he spoke.

"I'll be staying in one of the rooms until you're all finished."

Everyone stared, bewildered.

Lumine too was confused—Azriel wasn't planning to stay for the rest of the discussion.

While they had a plan, it still needed to be meticulously crafted, with every detail accounted for.

Surely, there was more to discuss.

"My prince, where are you going?" Amon asked.

Azriel stopped, turning his head slightly.

"To sleep."

[AN: Perhaps some of you have noticed, and some may not have, but I wanted to let you know that if you did notice a drop in the quality of the chapters, it's because I've been sick while writing. Please bear with me...]

Chapter 128: The Past You Can't Escape [1]

"Do the gods find this funny...?"

Azriel stared grimly at his surroundings.

He was standing in the middle of a street, cars passing through him as though he didn't exist.

Around him, towering buildings loomed, their presence familiar yet alien.

He would have thought he was back at EASC if it weren't for the brands of cars—ones he knew didn't belong to this world—driving through his body.

With a sigh, Azriel pressed his palm to his face.

"Why can't I sleep peacefully for once?"

The last thing he remembered was sitting at the meeting.

Exhaustion hit him like a wave, creeping into his bones.

He'd tried to fend it off with [Void Mind], a skill that also helped him stay alert while juggling multiple thoughts.

But it wasn't enough.

Conversations with Amon and Jasmine faded into the background, and eventually, he had to excuse himself, rushing off to a tent set aside for him.

The ruins weren't the best place to sleep, especially with the void capital still under construction.

The builders, though superhuman, were racing against time.

And if a void creature attacked, things could get messy.

But this... this wasn't normal exhaustion.

"A dream, huh..."

Murmuring under his breath, Azriel started walking.

He felt like a ghost, his feet passing over the sidewalk as people on their phones or in conversation drifted through him.

There was no sensation as they phased through his body.

He glanced up—the sky was clear, not cracked like he was used to.

The sun shone brightly, warm and comforting.

But something was off.

Azriel furrowed his brows.

"Shouldn't some sort of entity appear by now? Someone familiar... or maybe a version of myself?"

He scanned the crowd, but there was no one. Just him, alone.

Sighing again, he wandered the streets, weaving through the faceless people. His surroundings were unsettlingly familiar, but he couldn't place why.

The buildings, the streets... It all stirred something in him, a growing discomfort that churned in his gut like dark, murky water.

And then, he stopped.

The place in front of him—it hit him like a wave of nostalgia.

A small smile crept onto his face.

It was a park.

A beautiful park with trees, a small river, children laughing as they played on swings, and families picnicking on the lush, green grass.

"I haven't been here since..." His voice faltered.

"Since their deaths..."

So many memories were tied to this park. Azriel stood still, trying to process what was happening, why he was even here.

But for now, he would take advantage of it.

"There's another place close by," he muttered, deciding to leave the park behind.

As he walked, more landmarks from his past came into view.

The nostalgia clung to him like a shadow.

Azriel chuckled softly.

"It really feels like a lifetime ago..."

The memories swirled around him, bittersweet as he finally reached his destination.

But it wasn't his house. Nor was it the graveyard where his family rested.

No, it was his school.

"It must be school hours, judging by all these students..." he mused, watching them file in and out of the building, dressed in their usual clothes.

His school had never enforced a uniform rule.

Without hesitation, Azriel stepped inside.

He found himself standing in the hallway he had walked countless times, racing to class or heading home.

His eyes scanned the faces of the students and teachers, but none were familiar.

He kept walking, his footsteps growing heavier with each step. His heart felt like a weight in his chest, his fists clenched tightly.

"I have to see it... just one more time."

Ascending the stairs, he noticed the number of people around him thinning, until he was completely alone.

At the end of the hallway stood a single wooden door. A small metal plaque beside it read:

Music Room.

Azriel exhaled deeply, his breath shaky.

He placed his hand on the doorknob, hesitating.

"I might never get another chance..."

Gritting his teeth, he turned the knob and stepped inside.

The light from the setting sun streamed through the windows, bathing the room in a golden glow. The curtains swayed gently in the breeze.

Then, a sound.

Tink... Tink... Tink...

A familiar melody filled the room, soft and delicate.

Each note seemed to carry a weight, pulling at Azriel's chest as memories he had buried long ago surfaced.

Tink... Tink... Tink...

"Oh..."

His eyes were drawn to the source of the music.

A boy.

Brown hair. Green eyes. No older than nine.

His small hands moved effortlessly across the piano keys.

"That is amazing, Leo! You really have a sense for music!"

It was himself.

A much younger version of his past life.

Azriel finally understood what he was seeing.

It was...

a memory.

Azriel bit his lip as he looked at the people before him.

A woman with black hair and blue eyes praised the little boy—Leo.

"Kaya..."

His music teacher.

Leo looked at her with eyes full of wonder, almost as if stars were shining in those emeralds as he smiled brightly.

"Really?"

He asked excitedly, hope sparkling in his gaze. Kaya nodded and crouched down to meet his eye level.

"Yes, really! If you practice hard enough, you might even become a pianist."

His face lit up like the sun, and Azriel watched with a sad smile.

Then...

Another figure appeared.

Azriel's eyes trembled as he bit down harder on his lip.

Her brown hair flowed down to her waist, and her green eyes mirrored Leo's.

She was... as beautiful as a forgotten dream, the kind that lingers painfully long after waking.

"Mother..."

Azriel's expression softened, heavy with sorrow as he gazed at her.

It was his mother.

Not some void creature imitating her.

It was truly her.

Or at least...

A memory of her.

If one looked closer, they'd notice the swell in her belly.

She was pregnant.

"...Lia."

"Mom! Did you hear that? Kaya says I could become a pianist!" Leo's voice broke the moment, full of joy as he ran to her.

Jeanne chuckled softly, warmth in her eyes as she crouched down and met his eager gaze.

"If you became one, I'd be the happiest mother on the entire planet," she said, brushing his hair gently.

Leo closed his eyes, a soft smile on his lips as he leaned into her touch.

"Hehehe."

Watching the three of them, Azriel felt his legs weaken.

"Haaa... shit."

His knees buckled, and he caught himself on a nearby desk, arms trembling.

He reached out with his right hand, desperate to touch her, but he knew...

It was futile.

They weren't real.

But still...

"Please... just look at me one more time... Mom."

Azriel heard his own voice, but no one else did.

His expression darkened, knowing all too well what would come next. Everything started on this day, after all. Perhaps if he'd never wanted to play the piano, if Kaya and Jeanne hadn't said those words to Leo...

A dark, bitter laugh escaped Azriel's lips as he covered his mouth.

"If only I'd never tried to be a good son... I wouldn't have been such a disappointment."

He sighed, staring solemnly at the scene before him. And in the next blink—

They were gone.

Only the piano remained.

Azriel clenched his eyes shut, gritting his teeth.

"They weren't real anyway..."

But it still hurt.

Opening his eyes, a faint smile touched his lips as a thought crossed his mind.

"Kaya... Last I heard, she moved to another country after getting married."

She had been his music teacher, but also someone Azriel had thought of as an aunt.

Unfortunately, before the accident with his family, she left. He never got the chance to tell her what happened.

Azriel slowly walked toward the piano, his fingers brushing its smooth surface before he stood in front of it.

Tink...

He pressed one of the keys softly.

A small, almost silly laugh escaped him as he pressed it again.

"It's been so long since I touched a piano... I wonder if I can still play..."

But before he could find out, his vision blurred.

His head grew light, though a calm smile lingered on his face.

"Maybe another day, huh..."

It seemed it was time to wake up.

He didn't know what was better—this, the dreamless sleep, or the nightmares.

Maybe neither was better.

He still hadn't gotten an answer as to why he was reliving a memory, or what the purpose of it was.

But... Azriel had a feeling he'd be reliving a lot of his memories from now on.

"Did you do this? My future self?"

For some reason, the image of that person with the scythe flashed in Azriel's mind.

No.

He was certain of it.

It was him.

Or at least connected to him.

Remember.

Azriel quietly observed as his surroundings grew more and more blurred. Occasionally, it felt as if reality itself was shattering before his eyes.

"I wonder what it is I need to remember..."

And then—

Everything turned black.

Chapter 129: The Past You Can't Escape [2]

"P-please, Your Majesty, you can't just walk in here like that!"

A commotion outside her office made Aeliana furrow her brow as she set her pen down, looking up.

"The Queen is very busy! You need to make an appointment!"

As Aeliana was about to get up, hearing the shouts of the maids, the door burst open, revealing a panicked maid and... a man with snow-white hair cascading to his shoulders, his clear eyes matching the sky on a bright day.

"Ragnar…?"

Aeliana looked mildly surprised at the sudden appearance of the Frost King in her office. In fact, the Frost King being in EASC—Crimson territory—without warning was a significant matter.

Ragnar's presence alone had already broken numerous protocols.

With a sigh, Aeliana looked at the maid, whose face had gone pale as she trembled, shrinking in the presence of two powerful figures. She had tried to stop Ragnar as best she could without risking her head, but it had been in vain.

Now, she wondered if her queen might take it for allowing another capital's king in without announcement.

"You may leave us," Aeliana said calmly.

"And make sure word of this doesn't get out."

"Y-yes, Your Majesty!"

The maid looked visibly relieved as color returned to her cheeks. She hurried out, closing the door gently.

Ragnar watched her go before silently taking a seat opposite Aeliana's desk, his face as unreadable as ever—a man brooding over a thousand things, yet his gaze remained locked on her.

Aeliana leaned forward, rubbing her temples.

'I don't want to deal with this…'

With a sigh, she leaned back in her chair, looking at Ragnar with a touch of irritation. Anyone observing would hardly recognize her as the Crimson Queen. Only when matters concerned her children's safety did she let down her dignified demeanor—every maid knew that.

"The last time you came unannounced, Celestina had just been born, and you and my darling drank so much my house nearly collapsed. So tell me, Ragnar…"

A vein bulged on Aeliana's forehead as she glared at him, though Ragnar's expression barely changed, only slightly paler.

"I know Lyraelle hasn't given birth yet, so… why are you barging into my office this time?"

Silence settled between them, tense. Ragnar looked at her without a word before he finally spoke, his voice composed.

"I tried to contact Joaquin, but I couldn't reach him. Where is he?"

Aeliana's face hardened, recognizing the restrained edge in Ragnar's tone. Most wouldn't notice, but Aeliana did. Only someone who knew him as well as she did could sense it.

"Why do you want to contact him?" she asked, sidestepping his question.

Ragnar's brow twitched slightly before he regained his composed expression. After studying her for a moment, he finally answered.

"It's about Azriel. He has information I need."

Hearing her son's name, Aeliana looked at Ragnar, her gaze narrowing.

'Azriel this, Azriel that—why is everyone always bringing him up?'

He was just a child, yet everyone around her seemed fixated on him.

"What kind of information?"

"Classified."

Aeliana's eyebrows furrowed, her tone sharpening at Ragnar's attempt to be cryptic.

"Ragnar, you came into my home unannounced. You would do well to cooperate—no one will take your side if you don't."

The room grew colder as Ragnar narrowed his eyes.

"Was that a threat?"

Aeliana smiled slightly.

"If it involves my son… yes, consider it a threat."

"…Fine." He let out a breath.

"Neo Genesis's recent attack was thwarted by Azriel. He managed to take down one of the Heptarchs, but we uncovered something crucial. I need more details about that organization, and I suspect Azriel has more insight than he's let on."

Aeliana's expression shifted as she absorbed Ragnar's words. Only a few days had passed since it all happened, and already, Azriel was one of the hottest topics online.

His accomplishment had been acknowledged by the Crimson Clan's upper echelon before she even had a chance to intervene. But she still didn't know why Azriel had done it.

'There's no way he would do it for fame.'

She knew her son better than anyone; he didn't care for such things. Nor was he the type to act on behalf of humanity. Like it or not, Aeliana knew her son wasn't that kind-hearted. He had a reason, one he hadn't shared with her.

"What crucial part did you discover?"

"…"

"I won't allow you to meet my son like this, Ragnar. You know how delicate everything has become around him, especially with what's being said."

Ragnar's face softened slightly as he nodded.

"I know. But we've learned that Neo Genesis is somehow working with a Skinwalker."

"…!"

Aeliana's eyes widened in shock, her gaze locking onto Ragnar's. The mere idea of a void creature cooperating with humans seemed absurd—something straight out of a fairy tale.

"I need to know why, how, and where. Azriel might know more about it, and I need his help... help to get closer to… it."

She watched Ragnar's face grow dark, the air between them heavy with shared understanding. She knew why he was here now. It all made sense.

After all… he had lost his parents to Skinwalkers.

The Frost Estate, and much of NASC, had been devastated in that attack. So many lives lost in what was assumed to be a random strike by void creatures. But… it hadn't been random.

Aeliana didn't know all the details, but she knew it had been carefully planned.

'If Skinwalkers and Neo Genesis are working together… could the Skinwalker incident in NASC be connected?'

Her expression darkened as the possibility sank in.

'And Azriel's been fighting them…?'

She didn't know what to think anymore. It seemed like every revelation only made things deeper, more complex. There was something she wasn't seeing.

'Neo Genesis… what is that organization hiding?'

Ragnar's gaze was fixed on her, patiently waiting for an answer.

"…Unfortunately, Azriel isn't here right now."

Ragnar's face fell.

"Where is he?"

She hesitated, weighing whether she should tell him.

'This is personal for him, and he won't leave until he gets to speak with Azriel… but this is getting too complicated for me! Why does my darling always have to be so irresponsible?'

Taking a few deep breaths to calm herself, she finally spoke, explaining what she could.

The more she said, the darker Ragnar's expression grew, his gaze increasingly judgmental.

"Have you lost your mind?"

For the first time, a strong emotion seeped into his voice—anger. Aeliana averted her eyes, unsure how to answer.

"You allowed your son—who you just got back from the void realm—to go back there with only your daughter, the future queen and heiress? All because you didn't want to cause a greater commotion by informing anyone else?"

Ragnar's voice was laced with anger, his usual composure cracking. "Do you understand how irresponsible that is?"

Aeliana met his gaze, though her expression softened slightly. She understood the gravity of his words.

"I know, but…"

Ragnar narrowed his eyes, as if piecing together a puzzle.

"This was Joaquin's idea, wasn't it?"

She gave a reluctant nod. Even she found it reckless, but it was what her husband wanted. Jasmine needed more experience, and quickly.

"It was initially only meant for Jasmine," she explained.

"But after what happened with Azriel, he joined her. Besides, Mira, Amaya, and… Amon are with them."

Ragnar blinked in surprise, then let out a hollow laugh.

"You and Joaquin really must have lost it. Have you forgotten how that 'old man' threw Joaquin in front of a grade 1 Monarch when he was young? Or the time he made him survive in the fallen sky—a part of the void realm no one sane would set foot in—for an entire week?"

Aeliana didn't respond immediately. She knew all too well the harsh way Amon had trained Joaquin; it was brutal, yes, but effective.

Though, perhaps, that was why he was missing a few screws.

What mattered, though, was that Aeliana knew both of them could handle themselves.

And she trusted her husband, who was still trapped, to be safe.

The mere thought of something happening to him felt almost laughable, considering everything she'd witnessed of his strength.

'Can he even be killed?'

Maybe it was impossible.

Azriel was more prepared than she'd expected, and Jasmine, with her natural talent, would manage easily.

With their combined experience and the others with them, they shouldn't face too many difficulties—at least, for the most part.

'Maybe when I retire, I should become an actor?'

Apparently, she had a surprising knack for it.

Eventually, she looked back at Ragnar, her voice calm.

"It's fine. We can't shelter them forever. Don't forget who we are, Ragnar, and why we are the great clans. If our children can't survive something like this, then it's a lost cause."

Her lips curved slightly.

"So relax. Let's have some tea while we wait for their return. In the meantime, you can tell me about your daughter... and, of course, the one yet to come."
