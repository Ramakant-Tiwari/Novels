Solomon's eyes widened, his smile stretching as he clenched his fists.

"Ah, you're not as boring as I thought you'd be."

Zoran's grin widened as well.

"Fair warning: Don't assume I'm your average Saint."

He suddenly pulled a small glass tube from his pocket, and Solomon's face froze in shock as he saw the black liquid swirling inside.

"The Supreme Archon is kind enough to gift us Heptarchs the blood of a Voidwalker."

Solomon blinked, his complexion paling slightly as Zoran uncorked the tube and drank the blood in one go. Solomon's expression darkened.

"...Crap."

Black veins began to spread across Zoran's face, pulsing unnervingly beneath his skin. He exhaled slowly, a twisted smile forming as he gazed at Solomon.

"Try copying this, clown."

The smile vanished from Solomon's face, replaced by a blank, unreadable expression.

No more words were exchanged. Both stood opposite each other on the fractured bridge.

Only silence remained.

It stretched for seconds... minutes...

And then...

"[Soul...]"

"[...Domain.]"

*****

"...What happened...?"

Zoran blinked, slowly rising to his feet. The rough texture of the ground pressed against his palms, as though he had been kneeling. His muscles were tense, his mind reeling, like he had just emerged from a trance.

A chill ran down his spine, and he instinctively clenched his fists. His vision blurred at first, disoriented. He had no idea where he was. The space around him felt wrong—unnatural.

Then his breath caught in his throat.

Everywhere around him...

He saw himself.

Dozens, no—hundreds of reflections stared back at him from every direction. His eyes, wide and unsettled, gazed from all angles.

Some reflections were twisted, others eerily still, like paintings with no life behind them. Some mirrored him perfectly, while others were frozen mid-motion, as if they had stopped halfway through a gesture.

The surface beneath him gleamed like polished obsidian, so reflective it felt as though he stood on the edge of nothingness.

Just below the thin sheen of black glass, another version of himself stared upward. Zoran's heart pounded, each beat echoing in the hollow silence of the place.

The sky—or whatever passed for one—was a dull gray, an endless expanse of mirrored clouds swirling and bending light in strange ways, casting distorted and warped reflections of the world below.

The space stretched infinitely in all directions, but it wasn't the openness that unnerved him—it was the suffocating presence of himself everywhere he turned.

Towering monoliths of broken mirrors jutted out of the ground, standing like fragmented giants. Each shard was at jagged angles, cracked and imperfect.

Some showed Zoran as he was, but others reflected versions of him out of sync—standing at a slight delay or performing motions he hadn't made yet.

Time was fractured here.

Zoran couldn't trust what he saw. His instincts screamed that some of the reflections weren't truly him.

One of the taller mirror spires distorted his face, the reflection smiling in a way he never would.

Its eyes seemed deeper, colder, as if it knew something he didn't.

The entire world around him was watching him.

Or worse—it was him.

"...!"

His skin crawled as every movement was echoed by countless forms. It felt as though his very essence was scattered, as if pieces of his soul were trapped in this bizarre reflection of reality.

This was no ordinary place.

A twisted realm where the line between reality and illusion blurred dangerously.

Zoran stepped forward, and his reflections rippled, as if the world around him were liquid, distorting with each movement.

Then, a voice.

It came from behind him. No, it came from all sides, from above and below. It was everywhere.

"Even with the blood of a Voidwalker, man... you really are absolute trash."

Chapter 105: The Show [4]

Hearing the mocking voice echo from everywhere, Zoran felt his heartbeat pounding in his chest.

What had happened? It didn't make sense.

He couldn't remember.

The last thing he recalled was fighting Solomon in a [Soul Domain] battle.

A deranged laugh echoed and bounced from every direction, and Zoran felt nauseous as he watched his reflections all around him.

Some moved with a delay, others froze, and a few even moved before he did.

Zoran collapsed to his knees, sweat dripping from his face, splattering onto the mirror-like floor as he stared at his own reflection.

"Just... what is going on!?"

Clutching his hair with both hands, he screamed.

And when he did...

The reflection beneath him smiled, cold and sinister.

"You don't remember?"

It spoke.

No—Solomon's voice came from everywhere, but Zoran's reflection moved its lips as if speaking in sync with Solomon's words.

"Well, you lost, obviously. Right now, you're in my [Soul Domain]."

As Solomon's words sank in, Zoran's thoughts ground to a halt.

"...I lost?"

His lips trembled as he looked at his reflection, which stared back with a mocking grin.

"No... no, no, no. How? How can I lose? I am Zoran, Son of Ruin! The Apostle of Ruin!

I can't lose...!"

Like a madman, he screamed at his reflection, shaking his head in denial.

"It wasn't supposed to be like this... This wasn't written! The future wasn't like this! How... how could this happen? Oh...

yes, yes, it's him... the prince. Prince Azriel Crimson! It's all because of him! If not for him, nothing would have gone this way!"

"You can't even take a loss like a real man, can you? Honestly, it's sad. But you should be proud of yourself—it's been a while since I've fought someone and nearly lost in a [Soul Domain] battle."

Zoran fell silent, his pale face reflecting his inner turmoil. Solomon's words weren't reassuring in the slightest, but the mocking tone continued.

"There are two main reasons you lost against me."

The reflection raised its right hand, two fingers extended.

"First. Do you know why I'm still a Grade 2 Saint instead of a Grade 1? One of the main reasons is that I've been busy mastering my [Soul Domain]. In such a battle, you failed to realize that not even a Grade 1 Saint could beat me. Not that anyone knows... and those who did?

Well, they're dead."

'...That wasn't written... mastering his [Soul Domain]... it wasn't in the book!'

Zoran gritted his teeth as Solomon continued speaking.

"As for the second reason: your stupidity. When I saw you drink the blood of a Voidwalker, I was scared... scared it would do too much damage to you."

Zoran blinked, confused. Solomon elaborated.

"Sure, drinking the blood makes you temporarily stronger... physically. But that doesn't matter in a battle of [Soul Domains]. That was your mistake. By drinking that blood, you allowed a piece of your soul to become corrupted. I worried it would be too much, that the fight would be over too quickly, but luckily for me, you lived up to your name—Son of Ruin.

Even with that corruption, you put up a good fight. Unfortunately for you, that small corruption was enough to secure my victory."

Zoran's mouth hung open, his face a mask of shock as he mumbled in disbelief.

"I... I lost because of the blood... but the Supreme Archon gave it to me... How could I lose when he gave it...?"

A sigh echoed from all around.

"We are saints. We didn't reach this stage by luck. We clawed our way up that mountain. But somewhere along the way, you forgot that. You started indulging, relying on those gifts from your Supreme Archon. In doing so, you lost sight of your greatest weapon—your own body.

You grew too comfortable, too confident, thinking you were untouchable. But by relying on those tools, you slipped. And now, you've fallen off the mountain. You've reached the end of your climb, Heptarch Zoran."

"..."

Zoran could say nothing. He could only stare at his reflection, his expression dark and defeated.

"You can still fight, you know? There's always a way out of a [Soul Domain]."

But...

Zoran shook his head, speaking in a hollow voice, his face bitter.

"There's no point. Escaping here would be nearly impossible, and even if I did, what then? I'd still have to fight you one-on-one... it's better to die than to let you use your [Unique Skill] on me."

A heavy silence followed Zoran's words. His reflection stared back with a blank expression.

The silence stretched on.

Seconds.

Minutes.

Hours...

Or perhaps it was only moments—Zoran couldn't tell. The concept of time within Solomon's [Soul Domain] was so twisted, it felt like ages.

Until...

Solomon's voice returned, drifting from every direction. Oddly enough, Zoran's body relaxed slightly, though his reflection remained frozen, staring blankly.

"Well, that's no fun... Pathetic, really. Even though you're absolute trash, the least you could do is try and climb that stupid mountain again."

Zoran clenched his teeth, refusing to speak.

Solomon's voice had changed. It was colder, lower, and brimming with anger.

Suddenly, the sound of shattering glass echoed through the mirrored world. Zoran's heart pounded, more sweat trickling down his skin.

But he refused to look away, his eyes locked on his blank reflection.

"Even though you injured me, you gave up so easily. I never thought a human would come so close to defeating me in a [Soul Domain] battle—especially since you're no Sovereign. Perhaps I should seek out more Apostles to battle. At least I made Azriel my partner, and it's good to know he's one of them."

Zoran's face darkened at those words.

But...

He couldn't worry about his siblings being hunted by this madman.

No.

All he could focus on was the sound of glass shattering, growing louder and louder.

"I hate you, but I still have some respect for you..."

Solomon's next words came from everywhere, and Zoran's reflections—each one of them—turned their gazes toward him. Their eyes were cold, unfeeling, yet that wasn't what sent a chill down his spine.

It was Solomon's voice.

A voice that twisted unnaturally in the mirrored world, distorting as it bounced off the endless reflections.

It didn't just echo—it slithered beneath his skin, sharp and hollow, draining the blood from his face as the shattering glass suddenly ceased.

"I'll make sure to go easy on you."

Chapter 106: An Act of Mercy [1]

Lumine sat precariously on the edge of the cliff, his legs dangling over the abyss, staring down at the black sand below with a solemn expression.

The wind brushed against his face, and he closed his eyes, sharpening his ears to the sounds behind him.

"Come on! How much longer do we have to stay here!?"

"It's been days already! At least let us return to the surface if we aren't going down!"

"I thought we were free to do whatever we wanted in the dungeon!?"

The cadets' voices rose in frustration, directed at Instructor Alicia, who stood there with a blank expression.

It was understandable; their patience was wearing thin.

One of their own had died—strangely and without explanation—and now they were stuck on this cliff for days.

Of course, they wanted to leave. But they couldn't.

Not with Instructor Alicia guarding the platform. Sure, they could explore the tunnels, but no one was foolish enough to try descending the cliff.

Lumine sighed.

'I'm bored.'

Yes, that summed it up.

He was bored.

This trip to the void dungeon had been uneventful, if not outright disappointing.

He had expected more—more fights, more void creatures—but instead, he was here, trapped on a cliff, waiting for the other two instructors to return.

But they hadn't. Neither had Azriel.

'Even Princess Celestina and Vergil left.'

Lumine's eyes dropped further, his thoughts darkening.

'I should've gone with them.'

Without a doubt, they were having a more eventful time than he was.

A sound broke through his thoughts—footsteps. Lumine's lips curved slightly.

He already knew who it was.

Glancing to his right, he saw Yelena sit on the edge like him, dangerously close.

She tucked a strand of her obsidian hair behind her ear and sighed, her gaze drifting to the blinking stars above.

"They say the most beautiful things are often the most dangerous... I wonder what resides up there."

Lumine followed her gaze to the stars.

"No one dares to find out. Most would rather clear the floors as quickly as possible instead of exploring. Not that I blame them. Anyone can die on any floor—it's just the death rate that increases as you go deeper."

Regret seeped into his voice.

It wasn't that he blamed them, but it was a pity that people didn't explore more.

If possible, he wanted to properly investigate every floor and discover its secrets.

Yelena chuckled, but when Lumine looked at her, her face had turned serious.

"Two out of three instructors are gone. Cadet Kanae died mysteriously. The top cadets of our group are all missing... all except you, Lumine. The cadets need someone to lead them, or they'll start making decisions that could endanger us all."

Lumine pursed his lips, looking down.

"I don't think they'd listen to me. Prince Azriel and Princess Celestina, they have the status—Azriel with his reputation and Celestina with her accomplishments. But us? We're from normal families, unknown to everyone. Who would follow someone like me?"

Unlike Azriel and Celestina, Lumine and Yelena had no prestigious lineage.

They weren't from great clans, and they'd been nobodies until their debut at the academy.

Most of the cadets still regarded them with wary eyes, even though they had grown closer over time.

But that probably wasn't enough.

Yelena let out a soft breath and smiled.

"Yes, we're unknown. But so what? Become known. Show them who we are, and make them listen."

Lumine looked up at her, captivated by the fire in her green eyes. The breeze caught her hair, causing it to flutter gently in the wind.

'Beautiful.'

She was breathtaking.

Her smile, enchanting. Her eyes, shimmering like emeralds. Her hair, swaying with the wind.

Lumine found himself staring for far too long before quickly looking away, gathering himself.

With a deep breath, he looked back at her, smiling.

"If you put it like that, I guess I should try not to disappoint you, Princess Yelena."

Yelena's eyes widened slightly.

"Oh? Since when did I become a princess?"

Lumine stood up, dusting off his clothes.

"In my eyes? Always."

Yelena's expression froze, and Lumine gave her a gentle look before turning away, heading toward the group of cadets gathered in front of Instructor Alicia.

"...That's unfair," he heard her mumble behind him, a wider small smile creeping onto his lips.

As Lumine reached the group, he furrowed his brows.

It wasn't that every cadet was complaining, just the loudest ones.

But naturally, the others had fallen into the same mindset, following the herd.

He sighed audibly at the chaos in front of him.

Without warning, he clapped his hands, the sound reverberating through the air. The cadets in front of him jumped in shock, startled into silence.

All eyes were on him now.

Lumine felt uncomfortable under their stares, but he pushed the feeling aside.

He had to stay composed. He took a deep breath and began to speak, his voice calm but clear.

"I understand how everyone's feeling. You're distressed by what's happening. You're scared. That's normal. Even I'm scared. And I know you all want to return to the surface."

He wasn't scared, not really.

But they didn't need to know that.

What they needed was someone who understood them, and if he had to lie to give them that, he would.

"But we won't get anywhere acting like children. We knew the dangers when we came to this academy. This is just part of it. If we can't handle ourselves now, we might as well drop out once this is over."

His words sank in, and he watched as their expressions shifted—some angry, some ashamed, some resigned.

Lumine, despite his composed facade, was far from calm. His heart raced with nerves.

'How does she do it...'

He didn't understand how Celestina could speak to them so effortlessly, without losing her composure.

But somehow, it worked.

No one raised their objections.

Just as Lumine began to feel relieved, Instructor Alicia's voice broke through the air, pale and tense.

"Shit..."

She rushed to the edge of the cliff, and Lumine felt his heart pound harder.

He quickly followed, joining Yelena at the edge.

But it wasn't his heart that was pounding.

The ground was.

When Lumine looked down, the hair on the back of his neck stood on end.

The ground trembled beneath him, and his eyes narrowed in shock.

"This is bad..."

The words escaped his lips before he could stop them.

Below, a horde of skeletons advanced toward the cliff, their bony forms varying in shape—some with elongated limbs and others adorned with tattered wings.

Hollow eye sockets glowed with an unsettling dark light as a few began to claw their way up.

Lumine pressed a hand to his mouth, repeating the same words.

"This is bad..."

Yet when Yelena glanced at him, she saw something different.

Despite his words, Lumine was hiding a wide, excited smile behind his hand.

Chapter 107: An Act of Mercy [2]

Jasmine glanced at the cadets huddled together on the platform, their backs pressed tightly against one another.

Most of them looked sick, their faces pale. It was inevitable.

Who wouldn't feel that way, knowing that among them were people plotting to kill each other?

And that wasn't all.

Her gaze shifted to Nol, seated atop the Dark King's throne.

No one dared look at him.

Who would?

Especially with all that blood coating him… and the five heads displayed at his feet, their faces twisted in pure horror.

The expressions alone told the story of Nol's cruelty.

Jasmine's face darkened as she stared at him. It wasn't that she opposed killing—they were, after all, enemies.

She had killed the two instructors herself, burned them to ash without hesitation.

A pile of their remains lay beside her.

But… she didn't toy with her victims like Nol did.

Nol was a child in many ways, especially when it came to his understanding of the world.

Things that should have been normal were completely foreign to him.

His knowledge of the outside came mostly from Azriel after losing his memories in the Void Realm.

Still, he was far too brutal.

And worse—he enjoyed it.

As she watched him now, playing with the heads, her expression darkened further.

"Hm… which one of these should I give to Master? I'm sure he'd appreciate the gift. But which one?" Nol mused aloud, his voice twisted with amusement.

"Or perhaps I'll give him all of them? No… these lowly worms don't deserve to be near him, even in death."

He clicked his tongue, as if in annoyance, and clenched his right hand into a fist.

The moment he did, the strings tied around the heads tightened and with a sickening crack, they exploded into shards of bone and flesh.

Nearby cadets flinched, their trembling more pronounced, but still, none dared to look.

'He's going to traumatize them…' Jasmine thought with a sigh.

She stepped forward, ignoring the blood and stepping over the remnants of shattered heads.

Nol blinked and quickly noticed her approach, rising from the throne with a wide smile, bowing slightly.

"My lady. Truly, it was a pleasure to fight beside you. The way those false instructors screamed as you turned them to ash—like canaries singing."

Jasmine gave a brief nod, her eyes scanning his appearance.

Covered head-to-toe in blood, Nol was no less than a nightmare incarnate, his silver hair now dyed crimson.

Her brows furrowed slightly.

'If Azriel taught him nearly everything… is this brutality part of that teaching too?'

Her mood soured even further, and her desire to see her little brother grew tenfold.

She had no idea how he was doing.

Locking eyes with Nol, her voice dropped, colder than usual.

"We're done here. Let's return to the second floor."

Nol's smile widened as he studied her for a moment longer.

"Of course. The mission Master gave me is complete."

Jasmine nodded, her gaze shifting to the cadets, all too terrified to look at them.

"Wait here," she ordered, her voice laced with disgust as she regarded them with cold eyes.

They trembled under her stare, shrinking back even further.

'Pathetic. How can there be such a difference between the first and second groups?'

She couldn't understand how these people were supposed to become heroes.

They were already breaking at the sight of some blood and betrayal.

Her heels clicked loudly as she walked toward them, the sound echoing ominously in the boss room.

As she stood before them, every cadet avoided her gaze, refusing to meet her cold, piercing stare.

She clicked her tongue.

"Look at me."

Her words were low, but they might as well have been commands from the gods.

The cadets flinched, their faces paling even further as they reluctantly lifted their heads.

They weren't just standing before Azriel's sister.

No.

They were standing before the heiress of the Crimson Clan. The future ruler of the East.

Many audibly gulped, frozen under her icy gaze.

"Stand up. You're all coming with me to the second floor. Prepare to fight more members of Neo Genesis. And if anyone refuses, I'll personally make sure you're expelled from the academy. After that…"

Her eyes flicked toward Nol, whose smile only grew wider.

"I'll order Nol to deal with you."

Their gazes shot to Nol, then back to Jasmine, their faces paling even further. Slowly, one by one, trembling, they stood up.

'I don't have time for this.'

Jasmine narrowed her eyes, and like frightened deer, the cadets straightened their backs and stood at attention.

She gave a curt nod, satisfied.

"Good. Prove your worth. Show me why you came to this academy in the first place."

With that, she turned on her heel, Nol falling in step behind her as they walked toward the center of the platform, close to the throne.

Jasmine glanced at him, and Nol gave a nod, crouching down.

Closing his eyes, he pressed his blood-soaked hand to the platform.

The runes beneath them began to pulse with a blue glow…

And the sound of chains rattling filled the air.

*****

Jasmine blinked as she took in the scene before her.

"Well, that's… unexpected."

Nol's voice sounded from beside her, laced with surprise.

Behind them, the cadets stared in sheer horror at the chaos unfolding ahead.

Her mouth twitched.

The second group was practically useless at this point.

After everything they had endured, it wasn't surprising.

Especially now, witnessing what lay before them—a battlefield filled with screams, where cadets fought against skeletons.

Some were human-shaped, others resembled long-dead void creatures, and a few even flew through the air.

But despite the chaos, the cadets of the first group weren't losing.

No deaths in sight.

That was thanks to a few standout individuals.

One was a blond boy, cutting through skeletons with a flaming sword, their bones disintegrating into ash.

Another was a black-haired girl standing behind him, shielded by his form as she fired her obsidian bow.

A glowing green arrow, conjured from mana, nocked and ready as she loosed shot after shot with machine-like precision.

Each arrow struck with unerring accuracy, piercing the heads of flying skeletons, sometimes taking out several at once.

Lumine and Yelena.

'Their coordination is incredible, as if they've fought together countless times.'

Maybe they had.

Jasmine shook her head and focused on the last key player—the reason no cadets had fallen.

'Instructor Alicia.'

She blinked as she watched the instructor wield a massive white hammer, smashing skeletons to pieces.

Jasmine's gaze shifted to Nol.

His crimson eyes sparkled with excitement as he watched the chaos unfold, like a child marveling at a festival of destruction.

Her expression softened, and she addressed him quietly.

"Let's finish this so we can get to Azriel."

Nol immediately nodded, dashing forward in a blur, leaving a gust of wind in his wake.

Her hair fluttered as she tried to hold it together with her hand.

Jasmine's face grew cold again as she turned to glance at the shell-shocked cadets behind her.

'Will they be nothing but a burden if we drag them into this fight?'

The thought lingered, but her lips curled into a slight smile.

In the end, she would.

They wouldn't die. Not today.

'They are lucky to have me.'

Chapter 108: An Act of Mercy [3]

At first, the only sound was their breathing as they quietly leaned against the walls, waiting.

Waiting for Solomon to come... or perhaps someone else. Regardless, they waited, eyes on the dark corridor ahead.

And as they waited, boredom naturally crept in, leading them to talk.

Azriel spoke the most, explaining the attack of Neo Gesis, telling his own fabricated version of evts. Celestina and Vergil said little.

Food and water wer't an issue—they had plty in their storage rings—but conversation evtually ran dry.

Azriel sat in the middle, with Vergil on his right and Celestina on his left. Celestina glanced at him, eyes narrowed.

Azriel leaned against the wall, eyes closed, looking utterly exhausted.

His appearance was terrible, if she had to be honest.

Blood covered him from head to toe. His clothes were torn, hair disheveled, and his hand... missing.

At least his wounds were healing, albeit slowly.

She still hadn't fully processed that Azriel had fought—and won—against Bson and his m.

No, she realized, she knew nothing.

Nothing about what was happing today made sse to her anymore.

There was a sse that Azriel was holding something back, some vital pieces of information.

Her gaze traveled across his body, evtually stopping at a peculiar sight.

'What is that?'

Her brow furrowed as she fixated on his left arm.

His sleeve was torn, bloodied, and faded into the darkness.

But now that she was paying atttion, she noticed something else—bandages.

His left arm was wrapped in bandages, tightly wound, leaving almost no skin exposed.

The flickering torchlight illuminated the bandages, and she blinked, confused. She hadn't se him wrap those.

That meant the injury was from before his fight, but that didn't make sse either.

Azriel hadn't fought in the void dungeon until Bson attacked him, and there was no time for such careful bandaging in betwe.

'He's be wearing these the tire time?'

Before the void dungeon, ev.

That thought piqued her curiosity. Why was he covering his left arm?

She glanced at him again—still asleep, or so it seemed.

Vergil was in a similar state, eyes closed, barely moving. The boy seemed to sleep more oft than anyone she knew.

Her eyes darted back to Azriel's bandages.

'Wouldn't they be uncomfortable? Covered in blood and sticking to his skin like that?'

Maybe she could get a closer look.

Maybe, just maybe, there was more to the bandages than a mere injury. Something he hadn't healed for some reason.

After another quick glance at his face, she leaned closer, her heart pounding.

For some reason, it felt wrong—like breaking an important rule or trying to hide something she shouldn't have touched.

The feeling made her pulse race as if she were a child caught red-handed after shattering her mother's favorite vase.

'They're just bandages. Why am I like this?'

Her hand inched closer to his arm, ready to touch the bandages—

Suddly, she froze.

A cold grip seized her wrist.

Her head snapped to the right, eyes widing as two crimson eyes stared back at her.

The same arm she had be about to uncover was now holding her tightly.

Azriel blinked, looking at her shocked expression.

They were close.

Too close.

Their noses nearly touched, and she could feel his breath on her face.

He glanced at his hand gripping her wrist.

"Oh…"

He gtly let go, and Celestina quickly pulled back, her heart still racing as she looked at him apologetically.

"Sorry… your bandages looked uncomfortable, so I thought I should change them."

She purposely left out her curiosity about why he wore them in the first place.

Azriel glanced at his arm, th back at her face before sighing softly.

"It's fine. They don't bother me. I'll wash them properly later."

Celestina's curiosity burned as she finally gave in and asked,

"Why are you wearing them?"

Azriel stared at her for a few seconds, his expression unreadable. She couldn't shake the feeling that something about those bandages was off.

Especially since he had already tak health potions, and she'd used her light affinity to heal him.

His eyes drifted toward his arm before he finally spoke, his voice low.

"…It's an injury."

Celestina frowned, her gaze shifting to the bandages again as he continued.

"An injury I got back in the void realm. Unfortunately, no potion or healer can fix it. So, I just cover it with these bandages."

Her eyes wided in shock.

'An injury that can't be healed? Just how severe is it?'

Looking at the bandages, a thought crossed her mind.

'Would becoming an advanced-ranked be ough to cure it?'

But she quickly dismissed the idea.

There was nothing she could do.

She didn't know any miracle that could heal something so severe, and Azriel belonged to one of the four great clans like her.

Whatever resources she had, he had as well.

She hadn't ev se the injury, and now her curiosity had turned into guilt.

Guilt for nearly crossing a line she might have regretted.

She didn't dare ask how he had received such a wound.

Lost in her thoughts, Celestina didn't notice Vergil had oped his eyes, watching Azriel with a deadpan expression as Azriel smiled wryly.

*****

"Brat, what did I tell you? She'd get curious."

Azriel glanced at Celestina, who was no longer sitting.

She was talking with Vergil, her eyes fixed on the dark passage ahead.

He couldn't blame them. Unlike him, they still had ergy and wer't injured.

Sitting idle for so long had to be exhausting for them.

Azriel shifted his gaze to the inferior version of the Crying Fog, Leo, who sat against the opposite wall, staring at Azriel with that familiar, unsettling smile.

Azriel sighed but remained silt.

He didn't want to look insane, talking to himself in front of Celestina and Vergil.

Instead, he just kept his eyes on Leo, knowing the insufferable figure could already guess most of his thoughts.

Leo's grin wided.

"Ah, now that I think of it, you're really going to die today, ar't you? The momt she sees you in this pathetic state, she might kill you herself."

Azriel's face darked.

Leo's taunt stirred thoughts of Jasmine—who by now had likely heard about everything from Nol.

If Jasmine saw him like this, bloodied, missing a hand...

He would rather face the Cradler again.

His gaze returned to Celestina's back, and he sighed quietly, disappointed.

One day, she'd master her light affinity so thoroughly that she could lose limbs and regerate them without a second thought... It was terrifying.

Imagine fighting someone who could heal every wound, no matter how severe, as long as they had the mana for it.

Leo noticed where his thoughts had gone and chuckled darkly.

"You're going to distance yourself from her, ar't you? Ev though that fool of an instructor died by your hand, you still list to him. Love. I wonder what that feels like."

Azriel's expression turned grim as he stared at the Crying Fog.

If someone like Leo ever felt love, Azriel thought, the world might truly go mad.

A sudd silce veloped the tunnel as Azriel closed his eyes.

It was peaceful.

No sound but the faint echoes of his own thoughts.

The pain in his missing hand had subsided, though the phantom ache lingered, strange but manageable.

And th...

Azriel furrowed his brow.

It was still quiet.

Too quiet.

Why was it quiet?

What happed to Celestina and Vergil's conversation?

Oping his eyes, he saw Leo, no longer grinning, but scowling as he stood, glancing a.

Azriel's pulse quicked, his breathing suddly heavy.

Sweat trickled down his face.

"Haa... Haaa..."

His breath came in ragged bursts. His vision trembled. Wh he looked at Celestina and Vergil again...

They were froz.

Their bodies completely still. It wasn't just them.

Azriel's eyes shot wide as he staggered to his feet.

A wave of nausea hit him as he pressed his hand against the cold stone wall to steady himself.

Goosebumps crawled up his arms.

The torches that lined the walls...

They wer't flickering.

No.

They were froz too.

"What is the meaning of this, brat?" Leo's voice was tight, unnatural.

Azriel's heart pounded in his chest.

It was just him and Leo now.

Time itself had stopped.

And th...

The unmistakable sound of metal scraping against stone echoed through the tunnel.

Chapter 109: An Act of Mercy [4]

The sound of something sharp scraping against stone pierced Azriel's ears.

It felt like nails dragging through his mind, freezing the breath in his throat.

His body stiffened, locked in place.

A rare look of panic flickered across Leo's face, his usual smirk twisted into a grimace.

He clenched his teeth, hands curling into fists by his sides, the only sign of his tension.

The sound came from the dark passage where Vergil and Celestina stood, frozen in time.

It was as though time itself had ceased to exist, and only the oppressive, bone-chilling screech of metal against stone remained.

"This isn't real... it's all in your head... I think," Leo muttered, his voice low, uncertain.

It wasn't reassuring.

In fact, it was terrifying to hear him, the one who almost always had something snarky to say, falter like this.

Azriel stood paralyzed, the metallic screech growing louder, matching the rapid beat of his heart.

Each time it neared, a fresh wave of dread washed over him.

'Move! Why can't I move?!'

His body refused him, every muscle locked in place as if turned to stone.

The scraping sound drew closer and closer, deafening, tearing at his sanity.

He didn't understand what was happening—it was too sudden, too incomprehensible.

A fleeting hope shot through his mind—'Solomon... could it be Solomon?'

But no. He knew it wasn't him. There was no reason.

A chill colder than death gripped him.

'Zoran won...?'

His thoughts spiraled into chaos, alarm bells ringing violently in his head.

He had trusted Solomon—prepared, strategic, invincible Solomon.

He couldn't have lost. He couldn't.

Yet here Azriel stood, utterly powerless, the scraping growing louder, more unbearable, until it felt like his very bones would shatter under the weight of it.

Then, heavy footsteps followed—each one echoing with deliberate, ominous finality.

Azriel's heartbeat matched those footsteps.

Whatever was coming...

He was utterly helpless.

Time stopped.

It could not move.

Seconds stretched into what felt like eons, and then, from the suffocating darkness of the passage, a figure finally emerged.

Azriel released the breath he didn't realize he'd been holding.

It came out in a shudder.

His eyes trembled, and even Leo—looked like he had seen a ghost.

The figure's dark boots clicked against the cold stone, each step deliberate, slow, filled with a weight that made Azriel feel impossibly small.

The shadowy robe hung over the figure like a void, its face hidden beneath a heavy hood.

But it wasn't the figure's appearance that sent ice down Azriel's spine.

It was what it carried.

...A scythe.

Not just any scythe, but a monstrous weapon, forged from pure night.

The blade—impossibly dark—seemed to devour the light around it, bending the air as if it were alive.

Its jagged edge gleamed with a sickly sheen, like it had tasted countless souls and thirsted for more.

Azriel's blood turned to ice.

He was staring at Death itself.

The figure stopped in front of Azriel, looming over him.

They were the same height.

And then, as if to rip the world further from its hinges...

The figure's face became visible.

"…Brat?"

Azriel's mind blanked.

Leo's eyes widened in shock.

Because that word—"brat"—wasn't meant for Azriel.

No.

It was meant for the figure standing in front of Azriel.

A figure...

Wearing Azriel's face.

Azriel stared, face to face with himself.

Yet... it wasn't him.

It was his face, but older, more refined, perfected.

There was an air of utter control, of boundless power, radiating from the figure's every movement.

Its crimson eyes bore down on Azriel with a godlike coldness, as though weighing him against something far beyond his comprehension.

Azriel felt impossibly small.

So small, like the figure before him was a colossus, its hand large enough to crush worlds, its gaze searing like crimson suns.

How long had he been staring?

Seconds? Hours? Days?

It wasn't Azriel looking at himself.

It was him looking at Azriel.

A shift, so small yet so monumental, snapped Azriel out of his daze.

The figure—the other Azriel—was the first to move.

He turned his head toward Leo, who stood paralyzed, bewildered, staring back at him.

And then, with an authority that shook the very air, the figure spoke.

"You have overstayed. It's time for you to return."

The voice was colder than the deepest abyss, each word carrying the weight of an undeniable truth, like the very laws of the universe had been spoken.

There was no defiance. No rebuttal. No refusal.

Leo couldn't resist.

With a mere wave of the figure's hand, Leo's form began to flicker, the same way his hands had before.

But now... it was his entire body.

"What—?!"

Leo's voice warped, glitching, like a broken reality.

He turned his gaze toward Azriel, his face a mask of terror.

Azriel, equally frozen in shock, could only watch as Leo's form distorted and then...

He was gone.

Just like that.

The hateful, tormenting figure Azriel had wanted to rid himself of—gone.

Azriel turned slowly back to the figure wearing his face, his lips trembling.

"H-how...?"

The figure looked at him, blank and indifferent, tilting its head slightly as though studying Azriel's very soul. It felt like there was nothing in the universe that could be hidden from this being.

"Everything happened faster than expected," the figure mused, its voice cold, detached.

"Does that mean her plan was a success, after all?"

Its crimson eyes locked onto Azriel's, and Azriel found himself unable to look away. Every part of his being was laid bare before those eyes.

"You are confused."

There was a strange understanding in his tone.

"That is normal. I was confused once as well. But you needn't worry... all you have to do is remember."

'Remember?'

Azriel's mind raced, but he couldn't utter a word.

The figure—his other self—nodded, as if that single word explained everything.

"Remember. That's all you have to do to continue."

And without another moment for thought, the figure raised its scythe.

Azriel's eyes widened in terror.

"W-wait—!"

But it was too late.

The scythe came down, swift and inevitable, cutting through the air with terrifying finality.

And as it descended, only one final sentence reached Azriel's ears, carrying the weight of absolute truth.

"Don't ever stray from your path again."

The world went black.

Chapter 110: An Act of Mercy [5]

"Urkh...!"

A sharp, searing pain exploded through Azriel's body.

He found himself slumped against the cold stone wall, every muscle locking up as if the air had been sucked from his lungs.

His heart clenched.

The agony spread like wildfire, blinding him.

He toppled to the floor, his body convulsing violently.

"Eukh!"

Blood gushed from his mouth, painting the stone beneath him as his eyes went bloodshot, wide and unseeing.

"Azriel!?"

"The hell!?"

Vergil and Celestina, frozen just moments before, snapped into motion, rushing to his side.

Azriel's face had turned deathly pale, his skin ghostly, drained of life.

His body hit the ground hard, the thud echoing as his muscles spasmed uncontrollably.

Azriel's mind was overwhelmed by the unbearable pain coursing through him.

He couldn't think. He could only endure. Teeth gritted, his focus narrowed to the searing, unrelenting torment devouring him from within.

"Azriel! What's happening!?"

Celestina knelt down.

"Get him on his side! Now!"

Vergil grabbed Azriel and rolled him onto his side, trying to steady his shaking body.

Azriel's eyes darted wildly, locking onto Vergil's.

His hand, trembling, latched onto Vergil's arm, squeezing with the last of his strength.

Vergil froze, his eyes widening as if he'd understood something unspoken.

Without hesitation, Vergil placed his hand on Azriel's head, his jaw clenched tight.

A sudden wave of cold swept through Azriel, numbing the fire inside him.

His consciousness flickered—vision fading, his surroundings blurring, the dim room twisting and warping.

And then, everything went black.

*****

Celestina stared at Azriel, who lay unconscious on the floor, shock coursing through her. It had all happened so suddenly. Just moments ago, she had been discussing with Vergil whether they should stay here, and then—

In the next instant, Azriel was convulsing, coughing up blood as if he were being torn apart from the inside.

She glanced at the blood pooled around him, still fresh, still warm.

His face... pale as death. His breath, shallow.

Who—what—did this?

There was no one around. No shadow, no enemy. Nothing.

Vergil let out a strained cough, covering his mouth as his eyes darkened.

"It... wasn't hard to knock him out," Vergil muttered, his voice tight.

"His mental defenses were gone. Completely."

Celestina's brow furrowed.

"A mental attack?"

Vergil shook his head. His face, grim, darkened even more.

"I have no clue."

They exchanged a glance, both unsettled. If it was an attack, why only Azriel?

He was the most injured, sure, but that didn't explain anything.

Eventually, Celestina let out a sigh as she stepped closer to Azriel.

"We should clean his face a little."

It was covered in dirt and blood.

Vergil nodded solemnly.

"We should also feed him a health potion, just to be safe..."

Hearing Vergil's words, Celestina hesitated.

She looked at Azriel intensely, weighing her options, before biting her lip and making a decision she thought she would never make.

*****

"Urgh..."

A groan escaped Azriel's mouth.

Opening his eyes slightly, his vision was blurry.

After blinking a few times, it sharpened enough for him to regain his senses.

He felt the back of his head pressed against something comfortably soft, as if his entire body were wrapped in a warm blanket.

Blinking again, Azriel caught sight of a girl with silver hair stained with blood, her gray eyes intensely focused on him.

Both her hands pressed against his chest, emitting a soft white glow.

"Celestina...?"

Her name slipped from his lips without thinking, and her head snapped toward his face, her eyes wide.

"You are awake..."

She looked relieved.

Realizing the position he was in, Azriel returned her gaze with an unreadable expression.

'I would have been happy had it been any other moment in my life...'

Unfortunately, it wasn't.

Celestina removed her hands from his chest, and the white glow disappeared.

As soon as it did, the comforting feeling of the blanket vanished.

Hiding his disappointment, Azriel slowly pushed himself up with one hand on the cold floor while Celestina supported him, holding his right arm, which ended at the wrist.

"How are you feeling?"

Azriel still felt like he wasn't really here.

Honestly, everything felt like a distant dream as he recalled what had happened.

But...

Glancing around the room, he saw Vergil leaning against the wall, concern etched on his face, and Celestina supporting him.

But there was no Leo—the crying fog was gone.

Azriel looked at Celestina with a grim expression.

"...I have no idea."

Truly, he had no idea what had happened—maybe later, but not now. His mind was too unfocused; he was simply exhausted.

Celestina and Vergil exchanged dark looks upon hearing his answer.

Even if Azriel didn't know what had transpired, it didn't make them feel any better.

"How long was I out for?" Azriel asked.

Vergil approached him.

"An hour, more or less."

Azriel's eyes widened slightly at his words. He snapped his head toward Celestina.

"You were constantly using your mana on me for an hour?"

Celestina blinked, confused, then nodded.

"You had consumed too many health potions, so this was the safest course of action."

Azriel had a lot to say about that.

What if they had been attacked? What would have happened then? What about now?

They only had Vergil—who was technically the weakest of the three—left to fight.

But in the end, Azriel couldn't complain; she had done all of that for him.

In fact, he felt nothing but gratitude, along with a twinge of guilt as he sighed.

"...Thank you."

Celestina's lips curved up.

"Of course."

Turning his head toward Vergil, Azriel opened his mouth, but before he could speak, another voice echoed from the dark passage.

"Looks like you can't catch a break no matter what you do."

Footsteps echoed before a figure emerged from the shadows.

Solomon.

He was finally here.

His hair was disheveled, and his complexion appeared unhealthy, with dried blood on his nose, mouth, and even his eyes.

All three froze—not because of Solomon, but because of the person he dragged behind him like a bag of sand.

'Zoran...'

Zoran, but what was left of him, at least.

Instead of the prideful figure Azriel had seen in the cave, the one before his eyes was a mere shell in comparison.

He had no legs, no arms, and no eyes—blood covered his face and hair, staining the black suit he wore, at least covering the sleeves that hid his missing limbs.

Azriel felt nauseous as he looked at Zoran.

Vergil turned his head away with a click of his tongue, his face twisted in disgust.

Celestina's face also grimaced as she looked away.

It was too much.

In the end, Azriel looked away as well, his eyes meeting Solomon's, who returned his gaze with an unsettling smile that grew wider despite his appearance.

"You look like shit."

Chapter 111: An Act of Mercy [6]

Azriel's lips twitched as he glared at Solomon, his annoyance barely masked.

Sure, he looked like hell, but Solomon wasn't faring much better.

No visible wounds, but the dried blood smeared across his face told enough about his condition.

Without a word, Solomon threw Zoran in front of Azriel, Celestina, and Vergil, as if discarding trash.

A groan escaped Zoran's lips, his face twisting in discomfort.

Celestina and Vergil paled, realizing with horror that Zoran was still alive.

They stepped back, unsure, while Azriel remained rooted in place, eyes locked on Solomon.

"You didn't kill him?"

Azriel's voice was flat, almost indifferent.

Solomon shrugged.

"I beat him without needing to. Seemed only fair to let you finish him off after everything."

Azriel's brow furrowed as he looked down at Zoran, who, despite having no eyes, seemed to stare back.

A strange, unsettling calm lingered between them.

Solomon's tone softened as he glanced at Celestina and Vergil, who were looking between him and Azriel, clearly confused.

"Perhaps the two of you should leave," Solomon suggested, his voice gentler than before.

"Wait somewhere else for a bit."

They hesitated, exchanging glances. After a brief, silent agreement, they both shook their heads.

"We're staying," they said in unison, voices firm.

Solomon raised an eyebrow, surprise flashing across his face before he smiled.

"Well, well, little birds finally leaving the nest."

Azriel ignored them, his gaze still fixed on Zoran as he crouched, struggling to maintain his balance with only one hand.

Losing his right hand had left him off-kilter, but he managed.

"I'm sorry, Zoran. You promised me a painless death, but I couldn't return the favor…"

Zoran's dry laugh cut him off.

"You think you're funny, don't you?"

Azriel blinked, caught off guard.

He wasn't trying to be funny. MVLeMpYr-unofficial-chapter

He genuinely felt a shred of guilt, seeing the pitiful state Zoran had been reduced to, but that was all. Azriel knew exactly what kind of person Zoran was—a monster, like the rest of them.

The guilt was fleeting.

He turned to Solomon.

"Do you have his ring?"

Solomon nodded and produced a white ring, holding it between his fingers like a trophy.

Azriel glanced back at Zoran, hesitation creeping in.

'Should I ask him this now?'

With Celestina and Vergil here, it wasn't exactly the right time to discuss what he was about to reveal. Almost no one knew about it—not even Celestina.

'Then again... what does it matter anymore?'

The future was gone, destroyed by his own hand. The proof lay before him, bleeding out on the ground.

Zoran, the once-proud Heptarch, reduced to this.

"Solomon said you lost because of your own foolishness. If I had to guess, you drank the blood of a Voidwalker and lost in a battle of [Soul Domain], right?"

Celestina and Vergil looked visibly puzzled, while Solomon shook his head, chuckling softly at their confusion.

Voidwalker.

They wouldn't know what that meant.

Zoran's lips twitched into a faint smile at Azriel's words.

"Do you have more of that blood in your ring?"

Zoran scoffed, though it sounded more like a raspy breath.

"Of course not. You know how rare Voidwalker blood is. The Supreme Archon made sure we only ever had a single vial at a time."

Azriel bit his lip, frustration gnawing at him. If only there was more of that blood—it would've been invaluable.

He looked down at Zoran, his heart hardening.

There wasn't much more to ask.

Zoran wouldn't answer any other questions; the man wouldn't flinch even under torture. The only option left was to end him.

There was no prison on earth that could contain a saint-ranked human.

His limbs would regenerate. His eyes would heal.

Keeping him alive was pointless, and Zoran would never reveal anything about Neo Genesis.

Azriel inhaled sharply.

"I'll give you one chance, Zoran. Work with me."

The room fell into stunned silence.

Everyone—Celestina, Vergil, even Solomon—stared at him in disbelief.

Azriel continued, his voice unwavering.

"You have knowledge that surpasses almost anyone. You're strong, and humanity needs strength like yours. Killing you does more harm than good. I'm not asking you to work for me, but with me. We can create a future where we don't have to give up."

The silence that followed was suffocating. Celestina and Vergil looked at Azriel, their breaths held, too stunned to speak.

Solomon's face was unreadable, but his gaze lingered on Zoran.

Zoran's twisted smile vanished, replaced by a mask of fury.

"I will never work with you," he snarled, his voice dripping with venom.

Azriel's heart sank.

"I was nothing before he came," Zoran continued, voice trembling with rage.

"I was filth, barely surviving on the outskirts until he found me—until he saved me. The Supreme Archon gave me purpose. Hope. I owe everything to him."

If Zoran had eyes, he would've been glaring daggers at Azriel.

If he had hands, he would've strangled him. If he had feet, he would've crushed him.

"You might've won today, but make no mistake—you haven't won the war. You were just lucky. You've played with fire, Azriel Crimson, and you have no idea how to extinguish it."

Zoran's voice was low, bitter, each word like a curse.

Azriel said nothing, his lips pressed into a thin line.

"You've started something you aren't ready for," Zoran spat. "You think you're clever, but you're not. If you were, you would've waited until you were strong enough to handle this on your own. Now, you're going to suffer and die—miserably."

The silence that followed was unbearable. Azriel and Zoran locked eyes—what was left of them, at least.

Azriel turned to Solomon.

"Take his head."

He felt Celestina and Vergil's shocked gazes, but he didn't flinch.

He didn't have the strength to kill a saint.

Not now.

And he wouldn't ask the two behind him to do it.

But they'd chosen to stay.

They had the chance to leave and didn't take it.

Zoran's lips parted, and a wild, maniacal laughter echoed through the tunnels, reverberating off the walls like the sound of something unhinged.

Azriel's expression darkened.

"Take his head. We'll display it before the entire capital. Let them see how Neo Genesis made their first public debut in Asia—let them witness how pathetic their leaders are, how worthless the Supreme Archon is, and how weak these so-called 'saviors' of humanity truly are."

Each word dripped with malice, but Zoran's laughter only grew louder, more unrestrained.

'I wanted to boost my reputation... what better way than to have his head under my name?'

He had already let slip to the two behind him that both he and the academy knew all about Neo Genesis—and that he'd been given a mission.

This would catapult his standing.

A single, decisive achievement as a prince that would elevate him to the level of the other children of the great clans... perhaps even higher.

Solomon's eyes met Azriel's, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other in mutual understanding.

Then, Solomon stepped forward, crouching beside Zoran, his hand gripping the man's neck.

"I should've ripped your tongue out too."

Zoran's laughter only grew louder, echoing through the darkened tunnels.

Blood leaked from his closed eyelids—whether tears from laughter or pain, Azriel couldn't tell.

Solomon's grip tightened around Zoran's neck.

He began to tear it apart, blood spraying as Celestina and Vergil winced, turning their faces away.

Even as his head was being ripped from his body, Zoran kept laughing.

No screams.

Only laughter—wild, twisted, and mocking.

Perhaps the laughter was his scream.

Azriel never looked away.

He watched as Solomon tore Zoran's head from his shoulders.

When it was done, the laughter ceased.

A silence far more painful than Zoran's laughter filled the place.

Solomon tossed the decapitated head toward Azriel, and it rolled to a stop at his feet.

Azriel stared at the bloodied, lifeless head.

Zoran's lips were still curled into a smile.

In the end, Zoran died smiling.

Chapter 112: An Act of Mercy [7]

An amethyst portal shimmered open beneath the blinking stars.

Out of it stumbled Azriel, his right hand missing, supported by Celestina.

Vergil followed, silent and distant, while Solomon emerged last, just before the portal vanished behind them.

Celestina and Vergil, still in a daze from what had happened, blinked at Solomon, the one who had created the portal.

Azriel, his expression tight, finally spoke.

"...You actually fought him?"

Solomon grinned.

"It's a long, funny story. I'll tell you another day."

The one he referred to was the Nebula King—Caleus' father.

Azriel nodded, curiosity gnawing at him, but he glanced at Celestina and Vergil, concern clouding his gaze.

'They've been silent ever since Zoran's death... Their first taste of something like this. Of course, they're not thinking clearly.'

It wasn't just them.

Everything that had transpired today was also a first for Azriel.

He had done things in this life that he never imagined he would do in his previous one.

Perhaps the difference lay in the fact that the weight of it all hadn't caught up to him yet—not with so many things happening at once.

And then there was that strange version of him wielding the scythe.

Nothing made sense.

How was he there?

Why did he remove the crying fog from his mind?

What did he mean by 'remember'?

So many questions, so abruptly, and yet no answers.

His expression darkened.

'Not now…'

Now wasn't the time for such thoughts.

He was too exhausted—physically and mentally.

Looking around, Azriel and the others found themselves atop the cliff, overlooking the vast black desert.

When he turned his head, he froze in shock, just like everyone else, at the sight greeting his crimson eyes.

Bones.

Bones littered the ground, and skeletal creatures moved about, attacking cadets.

Almost all of the skeletons lay defeated, reduced to mere remnants of battle, easily dispatched.

It felt as if he were gazing at the aftermath of a war—which, in a sense, it was.

Humans had clearly triumphed against the skeletons, evidenced by the lack of bodies still intact. No flesh, no blood—just bones scattered across the battlefield.

Skeletons in the shapes of different creatures—some human, some strangely resembling dinosaurs.

There was a variety of them, including creatures with wings.

The fact that they had won without any casualties was a feat Azriel doubted he could achieve.

Azriel's expression grew grim as an unsettling realization dawned on him.

'Four apostles.'

The number on the same floor had broken one of the rules, triggering a stampede of skeletons.

Luckily, they were weak enough to pose little harm since Zoran had been quickly dealt with, reducing the apostles to three on the same floor—still breaking the rules, but it clearly made a difference.

'For now, at least.'

Azriel was sure the void dungeon would spawn something new and far more nightmarish the longer he, Vergil, and Lumine remained on the same floor.

With Celestina's support, Azriel walked forward, the others following closely. As they moved, the cadets began to notice their presence, a myriad of expressions painted on their faces, most of which were horror and surprise.

Celestina was covered in dried blood and dirt, Azriel bore the marks of battle, missing his right hand and smeared with blood, while Solomon, too, appeared battered despite his unexpected presence.

Vergil, on the other hand, stood out, seemingly unharmed, with little dirt or blood on him.

Yet, none of them smiled.

As they progressed further, stepping on the bones that crunched beneath his feet, more cadets began to notice them.

Each time they noticed him and his group, they looked surprised, standing up and slowly following from behind.

It kept going like that.

The further they walked, the fewer skeletons they saw. None attacked them, though. They wouldn't.

Even the dead knew not to attack when a saint was present.

As they walked, Azriel and the other three finally reached the center of the battlefield.

The remaining skeletons were no longer in sight.

"Cadet Azriel... Instructor Solomon?"

Instructor Alicia's voice broke through the silence as she rushed towards them, baffled.

A hammer was in her hand, at least almost her entire size, yet she carried it effortlessly.

Looking at her appearance, one wouldn't have thought she could use such a weapon.

"What are you doing here?"

"...."

"Azriel!" came a shout.

His head snapped toward the voice, seeing Jasmine and Nol rushing toward them, Yelena and Lumine following closely behind.

A group began to form, all cadets gathering at the center.

But just like the others, Jasmine gasped, her face paling as she examined their appearances.

"Y-your hand...! What happened to it...?"

Her gaze lingered on his missing limb, and Yelena and Lumine looked equally solemn.

Everyone did.

There was no blood coming from it since Azriel had taken a lot of health potions, and Celestina's light affinity helped a lot.

Unfortunately, no one had bandages—at least not for his missing right hand.

Some of the cadets looked sick.

Jasmine doubted her eyes as a panicked look came over her face.

'Calm down; I am fine. We will talk later.'

But with a gaze, he smiled slightly at her as she bit her lip.

Azriel studied everyone calmly, his eyes meeting Nol's.

Nol's expression was blank, devoid of emotion, though his furrowed brow betrayed his inner turmoil.

'He's holding back… a lot.'

Glancing around, Azriel sighed inwardly.

'It seems that no one died…'

Perhaps it was better if some had perished—or perhaps not.

All Azriel knew was that too many deaths wouldn't have been better for anyone, and his priority wasn't their lives.

His focus was solely on taking down a Heptarch, which he succeeded in doing.

Of course, with Nol's help, he also ensured that no one died during the mission assigned by Freya.

Nol hadn't even needed to call on Lumine, as Freya had used Jasmine instead, which Nol took advantage of.

Ignoring the crowd, his gaze fell on one person: Instructor Alicia.

Azriel bit his lip, meeting her questioning eyes—eyes that demanded to know not just what had happened to his hand.

'Ah... I really don't want to do this.'

He hated this part.

The air grew suffocating, the silence painful as everyone waited. Jasmine's shocked gaze burned into him, but he didn't look at her. He just wanted to be done with it.

Azriel's left hand reached into his torn pocket, pulling something out.

With a heavy heart, he extended his left hand before him, opening his palm to reveal a single wedding ring, its white gem shimmering beautifully beneath the stars.

His eyes locked onto Alicia's trembling figure as she stared at the ring.

"What... what is the meaning of this?" her voice quivered, her gaze flickering between the ring and Azriel.

Azriel's expression was solemn as he spoke softly.

"Instructor Kevin... and Instructor Benson. They both died after a terrorist organization infiltrated the dungeon. They fought until the end. They died like heroes."

The silence was deafening.

If silence could grow louder, it did now.

It took a few seconds for the words to sink in.

When they did, Alicia's hammer fell from her grasp, smashing onto a bone, shattering it beneath its weight.

Both her hands rose slowly to her face, trembling, her entire body shaking.

Tears welled in her eyes, cascading down her cheeks and splattering on the ground.

"N-No… this is a lie… You're lying! They can't be dead! Please… my prince… tell me you're lying."

Azriel watched her, his eyes unreadable.

"...I'm sorry."

For a few seconds, Azriel met her gaze as she kept murmuring, tears streaming down her face.

Most of the cadets had lowered their heads, eyes filled with sorrow.

His voice held no particular emotion, but it was enough.

Alicia collapsed to the ground, her body shaking as tears poured from her eyes.

A few female cadets rushed to her side, supporting her as she broke down.

Azriel crouched with Celestina's help, placing the wedding ring in front of Alicia.

Then, he stood, turning to face Jasmine, who looked at him with a complicated expression. MVLeMpYr-reader

'Later.'

'...I know.'

Jasmine nodded slightly, their silent communication understood.

Solomon stepped forward, scanning the crowd of cadets as he assessed them. After a moment, he sighed.

"The void dungeon trip is officially canceled. We're heading back to the surface. Neo Genesis attacked there as well. It's chaos up above, but you are future heroes. Important figures, like the Headmistress and Grandmaster Thomas, will be waiting. Behave accordingly.

If you have any concerns, come to me."

His words settled over them like a heavy blanket, faces darkening as they nodded in silence.

As Solomon walked toward the platform, the cadets followed, their movements quiet and restrained.

Azriel stood still, watching as Alicia was helped to her feet.

He nodded at the female cadets as they led her away, her sobs growing distant.

Watching her retreating form, Azriel felt a heavy weight inside him.

He had lied about their deaths.

He didn't want to dishonor their memories, not for Instructor Alicia's sake.

Watching her figure grow smaller, Azriel sighed before moving forward again with Celestina's support.

The others followed silently.

In the end, it was only natural for Alicia to feel broken.

Alicia, Kevin, and Benson had been childhood friends, after all.

And… Alicia was Benson's wife.

The lie he told her was an act of mercy—for her, for Benson, and for himself.

Chapter 113: Aftermath [1]

The journey back to the surface took less than a day, but no one rejoiced.

They all walked in silence, following Solomon.

When they emerged from the black hole, the sensation of drowning left many of the cadets nauseous. Some puked and crouched down.

Azriel, however, held himself together as he surveyed the scene, realizing Solomon had been right.

It was chaos.

Dozens of men in black military uniforms rushed about, shouting orders.

Vehicles roared, and healers were scattered among the wounded.

The atmosphere was frantic.

Azriel followed Solomon, leaving Celestina behind as he scanned the area, his anxiety growing.

'Where is he...?'

Thankfully, moments later, two figures appeared before Solomon and Azriel, causing the other cadets—those who had recovered from their nausea—to reel back in shock.

Headmistress Freya and Grandmaster Thomas stood in front of them.

'Good, he got my message…'

Originally, Solomon was supposed to handle the surface attack, but Azriel had made other plans.

His focus had been on killing a Heptarch, and so he and Solomon had devised a separate strategy—one only Nol had known about.

But Azriel wasn't heartless enough to let his plan result in mass casualties above.

So, he reached out to Grandmaster Thomas in secret, ensuring his arrival without the Frost King's knowledge.

Thomas wasn't a Saint, but he was still a Grandmaster—more than enough to ensure minimal casualties on the surface.

Azriel trusted his experience.

His eyes met Freya's cold, rose-colored gaze.

She hadn't been aware of his plan.

Freya had rooted out the Neo Genesis spies at the academy, along with the other three renowned instructors.

Now, her silent stare weighed heavily on him.

The cadets paled under her presence, an invisible pressure making it hard to breathe.

Her expression was unreadable, save for the slight narrowing of her eyes.

'She's pissed...'

Azriel felt his lips twitch.

He had fooled her not once, not twice, but three times.

It must have hurt her pride.

Without his status, he had no doubt he would've already faced her wrath. story-by-NovelFire

But Freya knew how to control herself... at least, he thought so—until he saw her eyes flick to his missing right hand, and the faint curve of amusement playing on her lips before she straightened her face.

'She's amused by this, isn't she?!'

Grinding his teeth, Azriel forced himself to remain calm.

He couldn't afford to act recklessly here.

Freya's gaze shifted to the crowd of cadets, her voice cold as she addressed them.

"You will all be escorted by the other instructors to the hotel where you were previously booked."

Her eyes found Azriel again.

"Princess Celestina, Princess Jasmine, and Prince Azriel, please follow Grandmaster Thomas and me. We will escort you to a different location."

A small commotion rippled through the cadets, but none dared to protest.

They couldn't.

It was clear that the academy's top priority, and that of nearly everyone here, was the safety of the children of the Great Clans.

Azriel nodded, and Jasmine and Celestina walked up beside him.

Celestina, still processing everything, glanced curiously at Grandmaster Thomas, who met her gaze and bowed his head.

"My lady, I'm relieved to see you unharmed," Thomas said, his voice strained.

Celestina nodded slowly.

"...I appreciate your concern, Uncle Thomas."

"Follow me, please. We have arranged a private tent for the three of you," Thomas coughed, yet for some reason, he avoided meeting Azriel's eyes, making him frown in confusion.

'Did I do something?'

He had, of course. Azriel had done many things, but none that seemed to warrant this behavior from Thomas.

Jasmine, noticing the odd tension, narrowed her eyes before catching Azriel's gaze.

Understanding passed between them.

She sighed, then unexpectedly wrapped Azriel's left arm around her for support.

"Let me help you."

Azriel blinked, momentarily surprised, before his lips curved into a grateful smile.

"Thanks."

They followed Grandmaster Thomas and Freya toward the tents set up by the government's military forces.

While the hotel the other cadets were heading to was undoubtedly more luxurious, in terms of safety, it wasn't enough.

Azriel, Jasmine, and Celestina—children of the Great Clans—had to be protected at all costs.

The safest place was where they would be closest to the soldiers and the heroes.

*****

Inside one of the private tents, Azriel sat down on the hard bed while Celestina sat across from him in a chair.

Jasmine remained on the bed, sitting beside him.

Freya had left to continue sorting out the chaos and calming the capital.

Solomon, meanwhile, was with the other heroes, patrolling the streets for safety measures.

Now, the three of them were left with Grandmaster Thomas, who stood by the side of the bed, his expression unreadable.

Azriel narrowed his eyes.

'He's really avoiding me, huh...'

He sighed, feeling a twinge of sadness at being ignored, and closed his eyes.

In truth, he was beyond exhausted.

The only reason he hadn't collapsed yet was sheer willpower, which was quickly fading.

'I want to sleep...'

But he couldn't yet.

Freya had informed him that a healer would soon arrive to reattach his hand.

Few healers were currently in the Sacred Capital and capable of such feats, so it would take time for one to reach the tent.

Azriel had told Freya not to rush them, prioritizing others first.

His hand could wait—he wasn't going to die.

Even though it felt like hell.

The silence didn't last long as Celestina, looking suspiciously at Thomas, was the first to speak.

"Uncle Thomas, that man Zoran... he said you made some kind of deal involving me. What did he mean by that?"

Her eyes sharpened, and Thomas immediately straightened his posture, his lips pressed together.

Azriel and Jasmine both opened their eyes, furrowing their brows as they watched him.

Eventually, Thomas sighed, his expression somber.

He suddenly dropped to one knee, bowing his head—but not toward Celestina.

He was facing Azriel.

"Prince Azriel, I offer my sincerest apologies. After dealing with the bombs and half the terrorists, I sensed a formidable presence near the entrance of the void dungeon. I rushed over, but..."

His face darkened with regret.

"I realized I was no match for that man. He was so strong I couldn't even move, and he threatened my lady's life in exchange for information about who called me here."

Celestina's eyes widened at his words, as did Azriel's and Jasmine's.

'So he met Zoran and couldn't even move a muscle...'

Azriel realized just how terrifying Zoran truly was.

If it had been anyone other than the madman Solomon by his side, things might have gone horribly wrong.

Before either Azriel or Celestina could respond, Jasmine's voice cut through the tension, cold and sharp as she narrowed her eyes dangerously at Thomas.

"So you sold out my little brother to the leader of Neo Genesis?"

The air around them froze, silence hanging thick in the room.

After what felt like an eternity, Thomas bowed his head even lower in shame and nodded.

"I did. I sold out the prince because of my weakness. I understand if my head needs to roll for this."

Azriel felt uncomfortable at Thomas's words.

He glanced at Celestina, surprised to see her calm, her expression composed and betraying no emotion.

Jasmine huffed, turning away.

"Why would your head roll for showing loyalty to the clan you swore to protect? You belong to the Frost Clan, not the Crimson Clan. It's natural to ensure the heiress's safety. I would've done the same if I had to choose between my brother's life."

Azriel blinked, feeling touched by Jasmine's words.

She glanced at him, her eyes softening with a kind smile.

He smiled back.

'I really am lucky, huh...'

He couldn't quite remember how they had grown so close, but he was grateful for it.

Thomas looked up, stunned but silent, as Celestina sighed and spoke.

"You're as loyal as ever, Uncle Thomas. There's no way my father or I would ever want you dead. You're family to us."

She smiled gently at him.

Thomas bit his lip, holding back his emotions, before hesitantly meeting Azriel's gaze.

Azriel smiled, massaging his jaw with his only hand.

"As my dear sister already said, who am I to judge you for being loyal to your family?"

Thomas's eyes widened before a relieved smile broke across his face.

He bowed again, his voice thick with gratitude.

"Thank you, Prince Azriel, Princess Jasmine, my lady. I've realized my weakness. That Heptarch showed me I need to change so I'll never have to make such a choice again."

Clenching his fists, determination flashed across his face.

As he stood, Celestina turned to Azriel, her smile fading.

"But how did you do it? Contact Uncle Thomas in secret and lure the Heptarch toward you?"

Her words earned her the stares of everyone in the room. Azriel smiled wryly.
