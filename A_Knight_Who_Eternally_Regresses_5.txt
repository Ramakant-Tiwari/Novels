He said as he dashed forward. Pounding the dirt and grass underfoot, he drew his sword. He got into position and performed a one-handed thrust.
'All out.'
With the determination to pierce through, but without letting his muscles relax after the stab. How to keep strength while thrusting with full force?
"You need a sense for that. How do you get a sense? Keep doing it. You'll get it eventually."
This was something Rem had said during training. Enkrid was now internalizing that here and now.
Thwack!
The tip of his sword pierced the enemy's chest. He twisted and pulled it out. The blade that sliced through muscles, nerves, and heart was withdrawn. He feigned a horizontal swing, then closed the distance and kicked the shin of another enemy soldier.
The soldier was just about to aim with his crossbow.
"Ugh!"
The struck soldier involuntarily lowered his head, and Enkrid struck the back of the soldier’s head with the pommel.
Crunch!
The move was like hitting a clumsy leather helmet with a blunt object. It felt like splitting solid green wood. After taking down two, he saw a third charging, wearing a thicker cloth armor and holding a large round shield.
Ping, ping, ping!
Enri shot three rapid arrows. But the arrows didn't penetrate the armor. No blood seeped from where they struck. One poorly lodged arrow wobbled and fell to the ground.
In his haste, Enri hadn't used the bow's full draw strength. Enkrid quickly switched his sword to his left hand and swung it.
Clang!
Sparks flew as the blade met the shield's edge. While it dented the shield frame, Enkrid’s hand went numb.
"Haaargh!"
The enemy roared, bringing the shield down on Enkrid’s head.
Thump.
A moment’s distraction could mean death here. Panic led to death. That was the battlefield. The Heart of the Beast shone in moments like these. Its courage kept him calm in the heat of battle. Enkrid could clearly see the shield's downward trajectory.
"Observe carefully, evade skillfully."
This was Rem’s teaching. Observe and evade.
"There’s no useless part of a sword. Use everything, from hilt to tip."
This was Ragna’s teaching. Enkrid watched carefully and dodged at the last possible moment.
Whoosh— the shield brushed past his nose, causing his hair to flutter from the wind.
"Huff, huff!"
The enemy, exerting his strength to raise the shield again, breathed heavily. Through the shield, he could tell the enemy was tense. The enemy’s eyes, peeking over the shield, glared at Enkrid. Clashing with the shield would prolong the fight.
Enkrid threw the sword, catching it with the hilt up and the blade down. He swung with full force, using his waist and knee rotation. Before the shield bearer could react, the move was executed.
Whoosh, thud!
The blade’s tip jabbed into the enemy’s eye. Blood and clear fluid streamed from the wound.
"Aaaargh!"
The one-eyed soldier screamed. Due to holding the blade, Enkrid drew his short sword with his bloody hand. He then thrust it into the neck of the berserk enemy and pulled it out.
Splash!
Blood spurted in rhythm with his actions. The shield bearer collapsed with blood foaming from his neck.
"Over here!"
In a sequence of brutal scenes. Everyone watched Enkrid with their mouths agape.
How many had he killed in such a short time?
Enkrid retrieved his sword from the enemy's eye. Blood smeared up to the hilt. He wiped it roughly and moved. This time, six followed him. He had saved two more.
"......What are you?"
The squad leader, sticking close while running, asked.
"Are you really asking because you don't know?"
He should run instead of talking. Enkrid ran east again. Along the way, he struck and killed every enemy he saw. He ventured deeper than before this time.
'I misjudged the direction.'
He was sure it wasn't the east. This time, he encountered fifty spearmen. A trained fifty spearmen unit was at the platoon level. The three of them couldn’t handle that. Losing the rest along the way, only the recon squad leader and the rough-looking soldier remained.
"We were unlucky."
The rough-looking soldier said.
"Damn."
The recon squad leader looked around and frowned.
Enkrid.
"I'll take five with me."
He steeled himself and charged. From the enemy’s perspective, he must have seemed insane.
Facing fifty spearmen?
Charging at a unit of spearmen was sheer madness. Perhaps only knights or those in a knight order could pull that off.
What was he doing?
Seeing him wield the sword, they knew he could fight, but not at an extraordinary level. At best, he might be called a skilled soldier.
Charging without regard for his own life wasn’t normal. Thus, Enkrid killed three spearmen.
And then died, skewered by a spear in the belly.
Of course, it hurt terribly. He saw a long banner lying behind the spearmen unit, and that was his last memory.
"Let’s go this way. Killing the enemy beyond the grass field will be an achievement, right? Or should we capture them alive?"
Listening to the squad leader’s words, Enkrid reflected on yesterday once again.
Review.
'There’s no way out to the east.'
Then it’s north this time.
Combat was a good nourishment. Even the two who disliked each other, Rem and Ragna, agreed on this. Even Jaxon had said the best way to train your senses was to fight for your life.
In those moments of death, human concentration broke through limits. Enkrid was proving that with his own body.
'I’ve improved.'
It wasn’t arrogance or overconfidence. Objectively, his skills had improved considerably.
And they were still improving. In the repeated 'today,' Enkrid died nine more times in the north. He died six more times in the east. In the west, he died twelve more times. The battles continued.
Skill didn't improve overnight. That was inevitable. But he could move forward step by step.
Enkrid felt joy once more. He was growing even now. Because there was a better today than yesterday.
"Uaaaargh!"
Thud!
During one of these repeated days, a fierce soldier’s spear grazed his cheek. Previously, Enkrid would have failed to dodge that strike. It was a strike similar to the spear soldier’s, but he avoided it.
He didn’t just avoid it. Countless battles had instilled good habits in Enkrid. As he dodged, he brought his sword down from above.
A vertical strike. And at that moment, Enkrid felt something strange. Though he struck, there was no sensation in his hands.
No, it was too faint.
Even though he cut the enemy’s arm, it felt like slicing through a rotten branch.
It was that easy.
On the other hand, the enemy's arm was cleanly severed and flew through the air. There was no sound.
A flawlessly clean strike.
The so-called cut with no feeling in the hands. The strike often achieved by those called geniuses.
"Ah."
Enkrid was so surprised it broke his concentration for a moment. It was the first time he experienced this in battle. He keenly felt the weight of the sword in his hand. The thrilling sensation left him euphoric.
"Ha, really."
It was too exciting.
Covered in blood, he laughed. He couldn’t contain his laughter from the overwhelming satisfaction.
"Crazy bastard!"
From the enemy’s perspective, he was just a madman. Nevertheless, Enkrid died countless more times. And repeated today countless more times.
In those repeated days, what he learned from training seeped into his body.
Chapter 26: Escape Route
‘I should have dodged there.’
Enkrid reflected once more on the previous today that existed only for him.
‘No, dodging wasn’t the issue. I focused too much on landing a single blow.’
Dodge what needs dodging, strike what needs striking. He had heard repeatedly that split-second judgment was crucial. From countless swordsmanship teachers, and from Rem too.
“What good is it to have the Heart of the Beast if you make the wrong choice? You’ll end up dead.”
It felt like Rem was right next to him, laughing mockingly. If that bastard Rem knew, that’s exactly what he would have said.
Enkrid replayed the moment over and over.
‘Today, I’ll take a slightly different route.’
He changed his path every day. It was the privilege of one who repeated today.
“We’ll capture the enemy recons beyond this grass field. How about it?”
As always, the recon squad leader was leading everyone to doom. Enkrid had no intention of stopping him. No, Enkrid knew changing the recon route was pointless. Even if he chose a different route, it was the same.
‘It means there are enemy troops ambushed all over this area.’
Enemy soldiers were packed around the tall grass field. If he wanted to survive, the answer was to return to base as soon as he opened his eyes.
‘That’s not possible, though.’
If he did that, it would be disobeying orders. Disobeying orders could lead to summary execution.
So, should he desert and leave the other nine behind?
Was surviving like that the right thing to do?
‘Is that why I learned the sword?’
Knight, general, hero.
Even now, he swung his sword dreaming of such things, but was it right to abandon them, knowing they’d be slaughtered?
Was that the best choice?
‘No.’
Everyone has something they can’t compromise on. Enkrid knew he wasn’t a saint or a good person.
But this was something he couldn’t compromise on.
Some would call it conviction. Others would call it stubbornness.
Enkrid didn't care what the others said.
‘It’s what I decided.’
If he had lived by others' standards, he would have given up everything long ago and taken a lazy position in a village militia. He discarded the option of desertion. His goal was to find a way out of today.
Fight again. Bleed and kill the enemy. This time, he used his sword as a shield and it broke.
He got hit in the head by a spear shaft. The world spun. Naturally, death followed. He wasn’t sure if it was the spear piercing his chest or the blow to his head that killed him.
The cycle repeated again.
He died over and over. By repeatedly experiencing life-threatening combat, he absorbed what he had learned from training. He recalled what he already knew. During all that time, Enkrid kept only two things in mind.
How could he fight better?
And how could he escape this today?
Moving towards tomorrow. Enkrid knew that relentless effort was required for that moment. Since he had survived two todays like that.
But this time, it was a bit different.
‘No escape route in sight.’
No matter where he went, the place was full of enemies. Why would they station such a large force in a damp, sticky land filled with grasshoppers, crickets, and tall grass?
‘Damn bastards.’
They were all well-trained soldiers. They weren't mercenaries who fought for money, nor were they conscripts dragged out reluctantly.
They were all paid soldiers. Some even considered this group elite. In a large-scale battlefield, elite would mean something else, but in a battle like this, professional soldiers were elite. If soldiers who trained and fought for their livelihood weren’t elite, then who could be called elite?
‘What a headache.’
In an ambush, he could kill three or four but more than that was impossible. Especially fleeing while fighting soldiers armed with crossbows.
‘An overwhelming force.’
Could he achieve it by repeating today endlessly?
Gaining such overwhelming strength?
No, he knew better. From the first repeated today, when he tried to surpass the stabbing soldier to reach tomorrow, what had that been for?
‘Learning in stagnant time has its limits.’
Enkrid knew himself well. To improve and feel the joy of growth, he needed a good teacher and opportunities. Not that he wasted repeated todays.
Training his hearing, swordsmanship, and reviewing battles. He repeated them over and over. Growth was slow, but it was happening.
“I’m confident in archery, but in the heat of battle, my hands shake.”
Enri said beside him. He had heard it several times. Though he claimed to have a small liver, he was quite good with the bow.
“Can you hit an apple placed on someone’s head from a hundred paces?”
He joked to clear his mind.
“A hundred paces is too far, but within thirty paces, I can try. If you place an apple on the recon squad leader’s head, I’ll give it a shot.”
“Too bad we don’t have an apple.”
“Indeed, it is.”
Enri knew how to enjoy a joke.
“But I’m serious within thirty paces. Not sure about the apple on the head, but I can hit a head.”
Enri added, with a rather serious face.
“If you shoot each enemy in the head with an arrow, you could take out about ten.”
Enkrid said, glancing at Enri’s quiver. The flat leather quiver strapped to his waist held about ten arrows. It was secured with leather straps tied around his thigh and waist, holding the ten arrows together. Later, he could loosen the strap and draw them easily.
As a former plains hunter, Enri seemed adept at handling both bow and arrows.
“Hey, what’s with the giggling? We’re on a recon mission. Seriously, tsk.”
The recon squad leader glared and clicked his tongue from the front.
Of course, Enkrid didn’t care. That brat had interrupted several times in the repeated todays.
‘It would be nice to start by taking a few down with arrows.’
The rough-looking soldier walking behind the squad leader signaled to Enkrid. It seemed to mean not to respond and just stay quiet. It was the same as before. There was no need to argue, as there was no need to get into a confrontation.
‘It would make ambushing easier.’
In Enkrid’s mind, a virtual battle unfolded. The information collected through repeated todays made the virtual battle quite plausible. In the end, he would die. Most likely, he would die. Even if there was a clear skill difference, the numbers were overwhelming.
If their equipment was at least advantageous.
‘It’s not.’
What would Rem have done?
He would have charged in with two axes, swinging fiercely. With Rem’s skills, even if he couldn’t kill all hundred, he could kill enough and escape. He was that fast and skilled.
‘It’s funny that such a guy is just a soldier.’
Rem didn’t seem particularly dissatisfied, though. In this troublesome squad, it felt like he was the only one with ambitions. Thinking about a squad member who wasn’t here was pointless.
Enkrid corrected his thoughts. A small snake slithered through the short grass. The grass underfoot was gradually getting taller. It was a sign they were approaching the tall grass field.
‘I’m not Rem.’
He drew another virtual battle in his mind. Suddenly, a thought struck him.
‘How skilled is the squad leader?’
Until now, he had been too preoccupied to notice properly. He just thought he wasn’t bad. The recon squad leader, the rough-looking soldier, and Enri. And the rest of the recon squad.
As his thoughts connected, he reached a conclusion.
“I don’t need to protect them.”
“...What?”
Enri, next to him, asked at the muttered words.
“Nothing.”
He had been foolish. Until now, Enkrid had tried to break through alone. He had fought to protect everyone by himself, reacting passively when encountering the enemy. Thus, he thought he had tried every possible method, but there was one left.
A way to completely change the game.
Crack, crack.
Enkrid cracked his neck to both sides. There was still some time before they reached the grass field. Enkrid walked forward briskly and grabbed the rough-looking soldier’s shoulder, pulling him back.
“Hm?”
The soldier instinctively tensed his body.
“What is it?”
“You were glaring at me earlier, weren’t you?”
He knew. It wasn’t a glare, but a look asking for understanding. But with a face like a weapon, even just looking could seem like glaring.
“No, hey, that’s not...”
“Why’s your tongue so long?”
Whoosh!
Enkrid swung his fist. The rough-looking soldier leaned back to avoid it.
“...What’s wrong with you? Are you crazy?”
The recon squad leader asked in bewilderment from the front.
“Fight me.”
Ignoring him, Enkrid kicked at the soldier’s ankle. The rough-looking soldier dodged that too, frowning.
“I thought you had some sense.”
“If I have sense, it’s because I can read your unpleasant glare.”
Rem had acknowledged it. He might be the best on the continent at verbally scratching someone’s insides.
“Fight me, you bastard who wouldn’t even look back at a passing cow.”
Indeed, that was the case. With just a few words, the seasoned soldier’s face turned red.
“Fine, let’s have it. You...”
Enkrid fought him. Instead of drawing swords, he used his fists as swords and his feet as clubs. It was roughly even.
No, honestly, he was slightly losing.
‘He fights well.’
By kingdom standards, he was at least at the upper end of intermediate, maybe moving to advanced.
“You said you were a low-ranking soldier?”
The rough-looking soldier, who looked like he’d fail to mate repeatedly, spat blood from his split lip and asked.
“Yeah, low-ranking.”
“If you get promoted, they give you money and stuff, so why do you stay like that?”
Enkrid knew. He wasn’t at the level of a low-ranking soldier. He hadn’t been a low-ranking soldier since he set foot in the army. He just didn’t feel the need to advance. He knew his skills and limits clearly. There was no need to attach a higher rank to himself.
Of course, it was different now. If given the chance, he would get promoted.
But it wasn’t his top priority. The standards that separated third-rate from second-rate, or first-rate mercenaries. The standards that divided the ranks of soldiers here.
What did it matter?
“You fight well.”
Enkrid honestly admired him. Yes, he was better than expected. He fought better than anticipated. He was likely the type to fight better in real combat if given the right opportunity.
“What are you doing?”
The recon squad leader’s face alternated between red and pale as he watched the fight. He glared and opened his mouth. He seemed ready to pounce on Enkrid at any moment.
Enkrid spoke first.
“It was a spar. Good for warming up.”
The recon squad leader stopped, ready to say something. However, at Enkrid’s confident response that was beyond shameless, he was at a loss for words.
“It’s fine. There was no ill intent.”
The rough-looking soldier dissuaded the squad leader.
Enkrid shrugged.
“Watch your mouth, troublemaker squad leader. You’ll cause trouble with that tongue someday.”
“That’s my problem.”
Enkrid replied and returned to his place. Enri, who had stuck close, looked at the swelling near his cheekbone and spoke.
“Aren’t you a low-ranking soldier?”
“Yes, I am.”
Was that so surprising?
A few recon squad members also glanced at Enkrid.
“You fought too well.”
“I trained hard.”
It wasn’t a lie.
Hadn’t he been making relentless efforts through the repeated today?
Despite the commotion, the recon squad leader insisted on entering the tall grass field. There must be a pot of gold hidden inside, or maybe his lover.
Hiss! Crunch.
Hearing the same sound, he knew the enemy was approaching again. It was the start of another new today.
“Enemy.”
Enkrid said with his split lip, nudging Enri.
“Over there, shoot.”
He wanted to see Enri’s archery skills. Enri didn’t respond immediately.
“Yes?”
It seemed he was frozen at the mention of the enemy. Even after that, Enkrid didn’t see him shoot properly. As Enri said, he might indeed have a small liver, as he fumbled hurriedly when the battle started. Still, seeing him shoot a few rapid shots, his form seemed decent.
‘I can’t do this as a squad member.’
Those moving with him needed to respond to commands, but he hadn’t established such relationships. Enkrid contemplated his position.
‘For now, I’ll put this aside.’
He ended up repeating similar actions. Fighting desperately and dying. Enkrid repeated several more todays. During that time, he could gauge the squad leader’s skill.
It wasn’t bad. He had clearly learned proper swordsmanship.
“I’ll take on any challenge.”
After a few repeated days of goading and playing along, the squad leader seemed to enjoy it. Enkrid got familiar with the squad leader’s habits and patterns through a few matches.
‘He lacks real combat experience.’
That’s why the rough-looking soldier stuck to him like a nanny.
Then, what was their relationship?
He casually asked.
“He’s the son of someone I respected a long time ago.”
The rough-looking soldier replied curtly. This guy was overflowing with loyalty. Everything he did here was for that brat. He was indeed a nanny.
“Noble?”
“Don’t you know fallen nobles aren’t treated as nobles?”
The recon squad leader was a fallen noble.
“I see.”
After that, the conversation was trivial, and Enkrid looked up at the sun overhead.
The midday sun. The wind was pleasantly cool. It was neither hot nor cold.
All the recon squad members were lightly armored. To move swiftly, it was natural. Light equipment and light armor. That was basic. Enkrid assessed the equipment, skills, and possessions of the allies. He had to be aware of everything else too. Enkrid put all he knew about the current situation into his mind.
Weather, wind, location, situation, allies, and enemies. If he could make all these things move actively, an escape route would appear.
Chapter 27: Why is He a Low-Ranking Soldier?
The recon squad leader’s name was Andrew. His full name was Andrew Gardner. Once a baron, he was now the sole heir of a fallen noble family.
His dream was singular: to restore the Gardner family in his generation.
“Andrew, you are our hope.”
His dying mother’s final words remained vividly in his mind. His mother had saved money by working as a seamstress and a maid in other people's homes. All the money was spent on Andrew.
From swordsmanship lessons to food and clothing. He didn’t have a prosperous upbringing, but he didn’t lack either. His mother, burdened by work, eventually succumbed to illness. Her wish was also singular.
“Continue the family line and become a great man.”
He decided to do just that. The only means to revive his family that Andrew could take was one.
It was the time of war.
Fight over and over again, and prove his ability. He received timely help when he needed training and he had connections. Before she died, his mother had asked for help from a man who was once like a sworn brother to her husband.
“You have talent.”
That was what the man, who claimed to be his father’s sworn brother, said. After that, Andrew received rigorous training and went to war. He started as a professional soldier and became a squad leader at a young age.
‘I need achievements.’
That thought filled Andrew’s mind. He was confident in his skills. The confidence came after he killed a few enemy soldiers in battle.
“You must be cautious in everything.”
His advisor and helper nagged him endlessly. It was almost unbearable. However, Andrew didn’t take those words lightly.
‘Surviving is also important.’
He needed to live to restore his family, but he couldn’t give up on a challenging life.
What happens to those who give up on challenges?
His father, who had lost the family’s prestige, was a prime example. His father, who lacked talent, swung a sword every day, but his talent was insignificant. In the end, his father couldn’t dream of reviving the family. He gave up quickly. He squandered the remaining assets, which was all his life amounted to. Then he was stabbed to death by a gambler during a fight.
‘A life without a future is bleak.’
Thus, Andrew dreamed of reviving his family while also valuing his own life. However, there were still things that annoyed him. One of them was the leader of the Troublemaker Squad, who caught Andrew’s eye. He was in his position because of his skills. He was striving tirelessly to revive his family, a noble ambition.
But what about that guy?
He was a low-ranking soldier with skills to match. By luck, he was in the position of squad leader, essentially a wage thief.
Was he worthy of living as a professional soldier?
Andrew saw traces of his father in him.
‘He’ll probably just take his pay and settle for today, eventually dying.’
He would live pretending to train by swinging a sword. A mere soldier carrying a sword and a sword belt for training was laughable. If he knew Enkrid, he wouldn’t think that, but Andrew didn’t know him. And now, the troublemaker squad leader was staring straight at him from the morning.
Their eyes met. An unpleasant sensation flowed through their gaze. At the end of that sensation, Andrew frowned.
‘His eyes are annoying.’
Just as he was about to speak, the troublemaker squad leader spoke first.
“Your eyes are annoying.”
Huh? Who is he talking to?
Andrew’s frown deepened. His scowl reflected his mood.
Then one of the soldiers who had followed him stepped forward.
“What did you just say?”
The soldier with a scar on his forehead. He was said to be a former brawler. Andrew had once told him.
“Follow me. I’ll give you a better life than a thug.”
He became Andrew’s trusted aide. Although his skills were still poor and he hadn’t completely shed his thug habits, his fighting skills were decent.
That’s why he brought him along. There were three such soldiers.
Those three subtly stood up and surrounded the troublemaker squad leader.
Enkrid had repeated today several times and came to a conclusion.
‘As a squad member, this isn’t working.’
These men needed to follow his words and act on his commands. That was the minimum requirement.
So what should he do?
How do knights gain people’s trust?
Why do they inspire people as soon as they step onto the battlefield?
It was simple.
Skill.
It was possible because they showed their abilities.
So what did he need to make the ten men, including himself, move as one?
What was needed to gain trust?
Since he couldn’t get close and build camaraderie in a single day. All that was left was overwhelming violence based on intimidation.
“Is that mouth of yours the problem? Should I carve a pretty tattoo on it?”
The soldier with the scar on his forehead said. His eyes glinted. He had a face that had probably beaten up a few people. This bastard's lines are consistent. Enkrid thought as he observed the three soldiers' positions.
It was a first for them, but today had already repeated several times.
Why the repetition? For one reason.
Violence and intimidation were more effective the more overwhelming they were. For that, experience was necessary. Apart from skill, he needed to understand their reactions and patterns. For that reason, the Vallen-style mercenary sword was excluded.
He had to subdue them with pure skill. The first gateway to getting past today was subduing the three thug soldiers.
“Did a cat get your tongue?”
The thug soldier taunted.
Enkrid thought words were unnecessary. So he acted. He took a silent step. The opponent reacted. He flinched and prepared to throw a punch, taking a fighting stance.
One of the three even placed his hand on the hilt of his shortsword. Enkrid first lifted his left foot from the ground, taking a very slow step.
With bewildered eyes, the soldiers watched, wondering what he was doing, but the timing was too ambiguous to question. Enkrid’s right foot quickly kicked the ground. Mixing slow and fast movements made it appear faster.
It was a simple trick, a ploy for the first strike. And it was quite, no, immensely useful.
“Hup!”
The soldier with the scar on his forehead inhaled sharply and tried to throw a punch. Of course, Enkrid kicked his shin first.
Thud!
Kicking his shin sideways disrupted his stance. Immediately, Enkrid struck the side of his temple with his fist guard.
It was a satisfying swing.
Thwack!
“Ugh!”
With a short scream, the soldier staggered and fell to the side. Enkrid’s subsequent movements were smooth as flowing water.
As he turned his body sideways, a shortsword aimed at his side cut through the air. Grabbing the wrist of the soldier holding the shortsword, he twisted it.
The key was applying just enough force to avoid injury.
Crack. Pop.
Twisting the wrist and striking the jaw at an angle, the second soldier also lost consciousness and fell. Enkrid caught the falling soldier by the chest and gently laid him on the ground. He picked up the fallen shortsword as he stood up. Without changing his breath, Enkrid asked.
“Do you want more?”
The last remaining soldier among those who stepped forward broke into a cold sweat. They had drawn their weapons first. Even if he stabbed now, there would be no excuse.
“What’s going on?”
The recon squad leader intervened after watching.
“You’ve been annoying since the first day. You’re just a kid who’s barely learned to walk.”
Enkrid turned to the recon squad leader instead of the trembling soldier. If there was no need to get angry, he could tolerate most things. He didn’t particularly care about the other’s words or actions. It had been like that until now.
But if there was a need to get angry?
He would say what he had to say.
“If I follow your orders, we’ll get slaughtered even on trivial recon missions. Let’s settle this with skill.”
Defying orders was a serious offense. However, the situation was peculiar. Enkrid was originally in the position of squad leader. If the other had respected that, it would be different. But he had shown thorough disregard and revealed his displeasure. No one could blame him for not holding back. In fact, even the higher-ups wouldn’t care who led the recon squad. Didn’t the recon platoon leader tell him to look after the young squad leader before leaving?
This was the time. When he had to step up, not just watch.
“...The one who wins gets to lead the squad?”
The recon squad leader frowned and asked.
“That’s fine. I have no intention of following someone weaker than me.”
Apart from Kraiss, all the monsters in the Troublemaker Squad were better fighters than Enkrid.
But this was just an excuse. He preferred the opponent to get angry and charge.
“Come on, kid who smells like milk. Have you even slept with a woman? Or is your dick not grown yet?”
Andrew’s face hardened.
He hadn’t had his first experience yet. He spent that time training his body. He felt as if the opponent was insulting his efforts, everything he had done to get here.
Thunk.
The squad leader drew his shortsword.
“You can draw your sword too. The length of the blade doesn’t represent skill.”
“Uh, well.”
The rough-looking soldier beside Andrew tried to dissuade him, but shook his head and sighed, stepping back. He had worked as a mercenary for quite a while. He had seen such situations frequently. There had been discord from the start. It might be better to resolve it now. It was more troublesome if feelings festered. Men often settled their emotions after a fight. Moreover, he knew Andrew well. He had taught him swordsmanship.
He might seem like a reckless kid but he knew how to handle a sword and had a straightforward side. Most importantly, he could distinguish right from wrong.
‘It won’t be easy, though.’
If things went south, he would intervene.
However, one thing.
Seeing the Troublemaker Squad leader’s stance and foot position, he didn’t seem like an ordinary soldier.
Thick, calloused hands, hardened to the point of forming scars. These were not decorations made in a day or two.
“Alright. I’ll do it barehanded.”
“This bastard?”
Andrew was agitated. That was a flaw. He showed his emotions too easily. It was something to point out later. The man thought as he decided to watch comfortably. It didn’t seem like it would end quickly. Neither had exceptional skills, but they didn’t look completely unskilled either. Nevertheless, he thought Andrew would win. Just because he was excited didn’t mean he would lose his fundamentals.
He had talent.
The troublemaker squad leader gestured. At the sign to attack, Andrew charged.
And then.
Thwack!
“...One hit?”
What the hell?
The rough-looking soldier’s eyes widened.
As Andrew charged, the troublemaker squad leader feigned reaching out with his left hand. Sensing it, Andrew swung his shortsword.
Then, as if perfectly reading the sword’s trajectory, the opponent struck the flat of the shortsword with his left hand’s leather gauntlet.
The result was that Andrew’s chest was exposed for a moment.
The troublemaker squad leader then closed in on the exposed Andrew. Inside the narrow space, his body moved dynamically.
Thud!
Kicking the ground and twisting his body, he extended his elbow, striking Andrew’s solar plexus precisely.
That single blow ended it.
“Ugh.”
Andrew groaned. His legs trembled. His breath would have caught in his throat, and his limbs would have gone limp. That was what happened when struck in a vital point. Andrew coughed up a groan, bending his back like a shrimp. In actual combat, he would have been as good as dead.
‘What strength.’
To transmit such impact through thick cloth armor. His skill was superior to that of most mercenaries. A question naturally arose.
Why was he a low-ranking soldier?
Chapter 28: Ambush and Blue Eyes
Enkrid sighed in relief as he watched the recon squad leader stagger.
'I barely pulled it off.'
Knocking the sword away with the back of his hand was a trick he could only manage half the time, but with practice, he had become more accustomed to it.
It was possible because he had learned this guy's peculiar habits. Otherwise, it would have been a difficult trick to even attempt.
However, from Enkrid’s perspective, it was different. From the side, it simply looked like a vast difference in skill. He had deflected the incoming blade without batting an eye and struck the solar plexus to incapacitate his opponent. A trick that would seem impossible without an overwhelming difference in skill.
“You’re a low-ranking soldier?”
How many times had he heard that? It was getting tiresome.
“I didn’t take the promotion test. Didn’t think I needed to.”
Enkrid had already prepared a perfect answer for the follow-up question. He cracked his sore wrist left and right.
No problems.
He had done all the necessary training while swinging his sword. Strength training was a given. In terms of pure strength, Enkrid was among the top in the unit. That’s why this result was possible.
“From now on, I’m the squad leader.”
Enkrid declared. It felt like he had just crossed a mountain.
The recon squad leader didn’t argue. He just stared blankly, mumbling, “You, you...” and then fell silent. No one objected. The influential rough-looking soldier quietly followed Enkrid.
It was as expected. After that, they continued to find a way out.
“Enri, what’s your dream?”
After rearranging the formation and moving to the front, Enkrid walked with Enri beside him. It was after the commotion had settled. Enri seemed dazed but quickly composed himself at Enkrid’s words.
“What?”
“What do you want to do?”
Enri blinked several times, then, seemingly flustered, he mentioned a rather detailed wish.
“Uh, well, to survive and live with a florist widow.”
Right. Everyone had their own goals.
“First, we need to get back alive. What about you?”
He turned his head and asked the one behind him. Andrew was right behind Enkrid. The first thing Enkrid did after rearranging the formation was to place Andrew directly behind him. He even let him keep his weapon. Enri thought Enkrid was truly fearless.
What if Andrew stabbed him out of spite?
Enkrid knew that if he got stabbed, he would just start the day over, but Enri didn’t know that. Andrew sighed deeply at the question.
“Fine. I lost.”
He said.
“So, what do you want to do, soldier?”
He was demoted from squad leader to soldier. No one objected. The difference in skill had been too clear.
“To revive my family.”
A fallen noble, indeed.
“Then you also need to get back alive.”
Enkrid said.
Everyone looked at the newly appointed squad leader, wondering why he was doing this. He repeated the same question and gave the same answer each time.
“To earn money, you need to return alive.”
This was his response to the soldier who said his dream was to save money and open a shop.
“Your lover is pregnant? If you don’t want your child to grow up without a father, you need to return alive.”
One of the thug soldiers was already a future dad.
“You all have the same goal.”
Enkrid continued.
“So let’s all get back alive.”
They couldn’t understand why he was doing this, but no one questioned him. Enkrid made eye contact with everyone. Normally, such an action would be meaningless, but given what he had said earlier, it wasn’t.
The allied soldiers, including Andrew, thought about what they had left behind. Enkrid wanted them to have a sense of purpose. He had started with violence and intimidation, but now they needed to fight well on their own.
It was a method he had tried several times. Instilling a desire for life in their hearts. It was a very effective method. It was much better to break through as a group of ten than to do it alone. In fact, they might even attempt an ambush instead of just escaping. An ambush could completely change the situation.
‘It might work.’
If there was even a glimmer of hope, he would try it several times. If he was prepared to die, he could do it. After several trials and errors, Enkrid memorized the enemy’s location and numbers. He spent several more days beating down the squad leader.
“What’s your dream?”
He repeated the same words every day. It could have been tiresome, but Enkrid spent each repeated day diligently.
He had gained two key things.
An ambush and a standard.
‘Let’s do this.’
After all those repeated days, he was now ready. He had practiced enough through countless repetitions.
“Let’s all get back alive.”
When Enkrid turned around, the entire recon squad nodded. They all thought it wasn’t a dangerous mission but his constant talk made their hearts stir.
“Let’s go.”
The techniques he learned through training were ingrained in his body. He no longer needed to repeat today. Enkrid didn’t move cautiously. There was no need. He had roughly memorized the enemy’s positions.
“Have you been here before?”
Enri, a former plains hunter, asked. He was standing alongside Enkrid at the front.
“A few times.”
It would be strange if he hadn’t. He moved so confidently.
“Ah, I see.”
After walking a bit more, Enri asked again.
“Are you a hunter?”
“No, I learned a bit from a hunter I know.”
Reading tracks and the direction of bent grass, that’s why. Enkrid had learned these things from Enri. Looking back while guiding the way, he saw the rough-looking soldier sticking close to Andrew. With that face, he would make children scream and run away if he became a real nanny. On the battlefield, he would be an excellent bodyguard.
Enkrid thought as he looked at Andrew and the rough-looking soldier.
‘If a battle breaks out, the rough-looking soldier will definitely follow Andrew.’
Even while walking, he repeatedly visualized the escape route he had found. When they reached their destination, Enkrid raised his right fist to stop the squad.
“Phew.”
He took a deep breath in the spot they stopped. Everyone looked at him, wondering why they had stopped. They were just at the edge of the grass field.
But no one spoke first. Enkrid was a domineering squad leader. He never discussed the direction or route. He was unilateral.
But it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. After all, the purpose of a patrol mission was to recon a certain area. If it were an important reconnaissance mission, more personnel would have been assigned. It didn’t seem like this unit’s role was that crucial. In any case, they just needed to do what was necessary and return.
“Shoot.”
Enkrid pointed in one direction and commanded. Enri, holding a crossbow, stared blankly at Enkrid.
A flustered Enri asked, “Huh? Where?”
It was a repeated event. There was no helping it. They didn’t have repeated todays.
“Shoot. I won’t say it twice.”
Enri wasn’t dense. Enkrid’s tone was cold, with an unyielding will. He was pointing beyond the tall grass. Nothing was visible. There were no signs of movement.
But Enri followed orders. He had seen Enkrid fight. Despite the rumors, Enkrid was not to be underestimated.
He drew the bowstring and nocked an arrow, the string taut. Enri glanced at Enkrid before releasing the arrow in the direction he pointed. Because the squad leader had ordered it.
With a whoosh, the arrow flew and hit something with a thud. At the same time, there was a cry of pain.
“...Huh?”
Enri was startled. At that moment, only two were not surprised.
The veteran rough-looking soldier and Enkrid.
“Follow me, Andrew.”
He had placed Andrew right behind him for this moment.
Although he lacked real combat experience, Andrew was still a decent soldier. If he had decent skills, he had to be utilized effectively.
In previous repeated days, Enkrid had made the mistake of trying to solve everything alone. Now, he knew that wasn’t necessary.
As Enkrid charged forward, Andrew reflexively followed, and the rough-looking soldier cursed and followed behind them. When the three soldiers reached the other side of the grass, they saw a corpse with a bolt stuck in its forehead and soldiers milling around it.
It was Azpen’s crossbow unit. About ten of them.
Enkrid started with a lethal move. A thrust. Stepping forward with his left foot, he twisted and drove his sword into the neck of an enemy soldier.
“Guh!”
Blood gushed from the wound in the soldier's neck. The soldier tried to grab the sword with his hand.
Enkrid kicked the dead soldier’s abdomen and withdrew his sword. A black hole appeared where the sword had been, and dark blood gushed out.
Meanwhile, Andrew swung his shortsword beside him. His swordsmanship was clumsy. He was clearly flustered by the sudden order to follow. He had just reflexively attacked upon seeing the enemy.
Clang!
The enemy soldier, who had thrown away his crossbow, blocked with a dagger.
‘Clumsy.’
But that was okay. Andrew’s presence here was also for the option he brought along. The rough-looking soldier moved. He didn’t shout or make any aggressive moves. He circled behind the enemy soldier who had blocked Andrew’s shortsword and grabbed his jaw with one hand and his head with the other, then sharply twisted in opposite directions.
Crack!
The enemy soldier’s head twisted at an impossible angle.
He was dead. The rough-looking soldier drew his shortsword from his waist and spun like a top.
Whoosh.
His shortsword sliced through the neck of the soldier behind him, between the helmet and chest plate. The skin on the neck split open. Blood spurted out.
Seeing this, Enkrid kicked the ankle of the soldier beside him. The soldier, who was wary of the sword in Enkrid’s hand, toppled over.
Enkrid kicked the fallen soldier’s head.
Thud! Crack.
The soldier’s neck snapped, and he let out a strange cry as he passed out.
“An ambush!”
“Enemy attack!”
Only then did the enemy soldiers shout in alarm. And only then did the rest of the allied soldiers, including the brawler-turned-thug, join the fight.
“Kill them all.”
Enkrid commanded.
Ping!
As soon as he finished speaking, Enri’s bolt flew. The bolt pierced the chest of the soldier in front of Enkrid. The bolt penetrated the enemy’s gambeson with a thud, and red blood oozed out.
“You son of a—”
The enemy tried to speak. Enkrid didn’t let him finish. He thrust his sword into the enemy’s neck.
“Phew.”
He exhaled, letting his muscles relax after the intense movement.
In the meantime, the clashing of swords rang out. He didn’t need to face them all alone.
Remembering this realization, he turned his body.
Hiss!
A grating sound came from three steps ahead. It was a scene he had seen many times.
The cry of a wary beast.
He turned his gaze and confirmed the source.
Black fur.
That presence was why some of the enemy crossbow soldiers had been careless. Enkrid had scouted several places for an ambush during repeated todays.
He had chosen this spot as the most advantageous at the cost of his life. The reason lay over there. The small beast wandering in the grass had drawn the attention of the crossbow unit.
It was an entity worthy of such distraction. He already knew. It wasn’t intentional, but it had been helpful.
The owner of the black fur looked at Enkrid with blue eyes. Enkrid’s blue eyes also looked at it.
Their eyes met.
One of the enemy soldiers clicked his tongue and stabbed a short spear at the black-furred beast.
‘It helped me.’
He had no intention of letting it die. Enkrid brushed his chest and extended his arm forward. His outstretched arm, with all fingers extended, stopped perpendicular to the ground. With that motion, the knife lodged in his chest flew through the air.
With a whizz, the knife embedded itself in the enemy soldier’s shoulder. Thanks to that, the soldier with the spear hesitated.
Hiss!
Seizing the moment, the small beast, barely the size of an arm, let out a fierce cry and bit the soldier’s calf. Blood and flesh splattered.
It didn’t stop there. The beast clawed at the wounded area with its forepaw. Its claws and fur were smeared with blood. After clawing, it swiftly retreated.
“You damn bastard!”
The soldier with the bitten calf stabbed the ground with his spear, but the black-furred beast had already evaded.
‘That creature.’
It was a clever and fierce young black panther.
The enemy soldier with the knife in his shoulder was killed by the rough-looking soldier before he could scream. Appearing behind the enemy, he sliced the throat with a swift motion.
The last remaining enemy was killed by Andrew. It seemed he had repeatedly stabbed the body with his shortsword and then finished it off by stabbing the face.
Andrew, having killed the enemy, panted heavily. He wasn’t the only one. Breathing heavily could be heard from all around.
“Huff, huff, what the hell is this?”
An astonished ally asked. The face was familiar, but Enkrid couldn’t recall the name. Instead, Enkrid spotted the body of a fallen ally among the dead enemies. No matter what he did, this guy always died. This time, it seemed he had been stabbed in the face by an enemy spear.
It was a gruesome sight. He had tried to save him several times, but the guy always ran off mid-fight, messing things up. This was something he learned from repeated todays.
“They’re enemy soldiers. Didn’t you know this could happen on a patrol mission? Don’t forget. We need to get back alive.”
Enkrid once again instilled a desire for life in the squad members.
“This way.”
The rough-looking soldier then spoke up.
“That leads further inside, squad leader.”
“Disobedience? If you were going to rebel, you should have done it earlier.”
Enkrid brushed off the objection and continued walking silently. As if there were no other options but to follow.
Silent pressure and coercion.
It had to be this way. There was no time to explain everything.
As he ran, he glanced to the side and saw the young black panther’s eyes. Blue eyes, like deep lakes. Enkrid turned his head, seeing eyes similar to his own.
It was time to fight for survival, not to bond with an animal.
Chapter 29: I Want to Live Too
“You’re going further ahead? This is madness.”
The rough-looking soldier sticking close behind Enkrid spoke up. After the initial ambush succeeded, the scouting unit, now led by Enkrid instead of Andrew, attempted two more ambushes.
The second battle involved a group of five soldiers, and in the third, they faced more than fifteen soldiers. Both were brutal.
In the second battle, there was a particularly skilled enemy.
In the third battle, the enemy simply had overwhelming numbers.
The number of surviving soldiers dwindled to seven. They had lost two more.
‘I can’t save more than this.’
No matter what, some things were just impossible. Enkrid knew he wasn’t a saint. Repeating today to save the three who had died would be like gnawing on fairy bones.
Thanks to Enkrid’s efforts, they had managed this much. Of course, the allied soldiers fought fiercely. One soldier survived but lost an eye.
Andrew had a cut on his face. He had his left cheek bandaged with linen—a wound that would be a proud scar if he survived.
Despite this situation, Enkrid headed deeper. It was like a reckless charge without considering a retreat. From a conventional perspective, it was madness.
The rough-looking soldier wasn’t lacking in skill or experience. Even in this situation, he hadn’t lost his sense of direction. He realized that Enkrid was heading toward the enemy’s stronghold. Seeing this, Enkrid nodded inwardly.
‘Not bad.’
He might fall short compared to Rem and other squad members, but he was still a valuable asset. With determination, he could at least become a platoon leader.
“From now on, we can catch our breath a bit.”
Enkrid said, causing the rough-looking soldier to frown.
“That’s not what I meant.”
“As I said earlier, disobedience...”
“Disobedience or not, if we’re on a path to death, I’ll find a way to survive, even if it means stabbing my squad leader in the back.”
This guy spoke too recklessly. What would he do if he survived and had to face everyone later?
He stared at him, but the soldier didn’t flinch. He was shameless. It made sense. A person’s life came first, not the mission. Especially someone like him, who was serving for a special purpose. Andrew’s life and his own were his top priorities.
Enkrid looked up to check the sun’s position, then stopped walking. Naturally, the allies also stopped. Everyone listened intently to Enkrid and the rough-looking soldier.
Enkrid spoke through the panting soldiers who were catching their breath.
“If we go back now, we’ll die. The enemy is swarming behind us like mad dogs.”
As he spoke, Enkrid loosened the guards on his hands. The leather-padded guards were useful, but wearing them for too long made his hand muscles feel crushed. Loosening them during a fight was dangerous, though.
“How do you know that? They shouldn’t even know we’re here. How could they have blocked our retreat already?”
The rough-looking soldier frowned as he watched Enkrid loosen his hand guards. He clearly didn’t like Enkrid’s nonchalant attitude. Enkrid had faced this moment dozens of times. It was a day he had repeated dozens of times. The enemy was numerous, and once they detected an ambush, they always cut off the retreat. Relentlessly. He didn’t know who their commander was, but they seemed desperate to hide their presence here.
It was always the same.
The allied soldiers crouched among the tall grass looked uneasy. They were following blindly, but hearing the conversation made them feel as if they were in the middle of a dangerous battlefield. Still, no one stepped forward. They just perked up their ears.
Enkrid glanced up again, calculating the time in his head. In three or four hours, darkness would fall. Then, the escape route would open. But first, he needed to convince these men to stay put.
Forcing them might work, but they weren’t the kind to be easily forced. Intimidation and violence had their limits here.
Ambush, retreat, ambush.
He had driven the squad relentlessly to this point, but now it was time to wait. Waiting brought doubts. He didn’t need to work hard to convince them.
“Don’t you realize it’s too late now?”
He was right. It was too late already. Turning back now was even crazier.
The rough-looking soldier bit his lip.
What kind of crazy bastard is this?
He seemed ready to say it but instead rolled his eyes and asked,
“You have a plan, right?”
Enkrid looked into his eyes, then at the surrounding allies, including Enri and Andrew. Their eyes were filled with doubt and fear. With their breath back, they had room to think, and thinking led them to realize how late it was.
Enkrid had no intention of giving a reasonable explanation. He couldn’t provide one, anyway.
How could he explain?
He had seen the future by repeating today?
To end this repeated today and move on to tomorrow, they had to follow him no matter what?
Who would believe that?
So, he could only say one thing.
“I want to live too.”
A short sentence, but it contained everything.
He wasn’t struggling to die.
The desire to live. It wasn’t just these soldiers who had it.
He needed to remind them that he was the same.
Of course, Enkrid could just repeat today if he died.
‘I won’t stagnate.’
No matter who the ferryman was. No matter how high and strong the wall in front of him was. He wouldn’t stop. For Enkrid, the repeated today was a mountain to overcome and conquer.
Therefore.
“Trust me. This isn’t a path to death.”
Without explaining, he sought their trust. He would twist this day with their trust and move on to tomorrow. The desire to live, repeated battles, the anxiety after excitement— people in such situations would grasp at straws.
For them, Enkrid’s short words instilled a deep sense of trust. He wanted to live and told them to believe. Also, they instinctively knew there was no other way.
What could they do here?
The enemy swarmed the tall grass. There seemed no way out. In such times, trusting someone was the only option.
“I really want to live.”
Enri muttered.
With those words, everyone looked at Enkrid and nodded. The rough-looking soldier remained calm, but he had no other ideas. Andrew was the most shocked. Beyond skill, Enkrid seemed like a person of great character. Right now, Enkrid looked like the future self Andrew had dreamed of becoming.
‘Calm even in this situation.’
He never gave up and earned everyone’s trust. How admirable.
“I believe in you too.”
Andrew said, his tone suddenly more respectful. It didn’t feel awkward. A fervent energy spread among the allies, reaching Enkrid.
“Then everyone.”
Receiving their gaze, Enkrid spoke.
“Stay low and quiet until my signal.”
With their trust, it was time to act. He led by example. He lay flat on the ground and held his breath.
Everyone followed Enkrid. They wondered what he was doing instead of running, but they had shared something intense moments ago. It was time to trust him for at least five minutes.
The rough-looking soldier watched a bug hop over his nose and disappear.
‘This guy is a master manipulator.’
His skill in handling people was remarkable.
Was this how he led the Troublemaker Squad?
It was a natural thought.
Rustling.
Then they heard grass being trampled. Everyone breathed carefully. There were signs of people nearby.
Not too close. The tall grass was like a dense thicket. Unless someone came right up, they couldn’t be found. It was a good hiding place. The sound of trampling grass came from all directions. It moved from front to back. They couldn’t see the situation, but...
If there was a bird flying above, it would see an amazing sight. The grass around where Enkrid’s group lay was shaking and moving. All the movement came from enemy soldiers.
However, they avoided the spot where Enkrid’s squad hid. Right now, the place where Enkrid had stopped was like an island of safety in a sea of enemies. Even with luck, it was nearly impossible to find such a gap among the moving enemies. It was like the goddess of fortune had not just kissed him but poured all her blessings on him.
Of course, this wasn’t luck. It was a trick he learned from repeating today endlessly. As the sound of grass trampling faded, Enkrid spoke again.
“Move out. Everyone, advance in single file.”
It was time to move. Enkrid straightened from his crouch and walked slowly until his numb legs recovered.
He thought how useful the sensory training from Jaxon was. Judging distance by sound and determining direction. It wasn’t a skill one could learn through ordinary training, but Enkrid had learned it while risking his life under an assassin and repeating today in the grass.
‘Passed the second target.’
After repeating ambushes and retreats, letting the enemy pass by. It was the second key to the escape route he had in mind.
Now only the third remained. That required time. Once his legs recovered, he increased the pace slightly. Everyone followed without complaint. They were all inwardly amazed.
No matter how they looked, the area seemed full of enemies. How did they avoid them so well?
Thinking back, the battles had been strange. They had attacked as if they knew the enemy’s positions. All the battles had started with allied ambushes. Thanks to that, they had fought from advantageous positions. In every battle, Enkrid was at the forefront, fighting fiercely.
He seemed like someone who didn’t care for his life. All the soldiers following him knew that he had fought risking his life. He had taken the most significant risks at the front.
In the quiet grass, a strange heat rose. It was the flame of survival burning in the soldiers’ chests.
Enkrid didn’t feel that heat. He was thinking of the next step.
‘So far...’
It had been smooth.
To be honest, it hadn’t been difficult. It shouldn’t have been. He had experienced this ‘today’ over fifty times. So it was the expected result.
Why had he experienced this ‘today’ over fifty times?
It was all for the next operation. They were a few, and the enemy was many. He didn’t know their intentions. There was only one thing he knew.
The enemy commander didn’t want anyone who approached here to leave alive.
At first, he tried to break through to secure a retreat. He failed every time.
Would it change with the squad’s help?
No way.
Then he changed his thinking.
‘What if something more troublesome than catching us happened?’
The sun was setting. The sky turned orange as twilight descended. As the orange light bathed the tall grass, it felt like entering an orange-lit lake. Today, the sky was clear, and the sunset was warm. The sun soon disappeared beyond the west.
Darkness fell. It was time to take the third target of Enkrid’s escape route.
Chapter 30: When Darkness Becomes Your Friend
When does darkness become your friend?
To this question, the answer is simple. It is when you are in a place you know well, a place where you understand the terrain as clearly as your own front yard.
Even better, if it's a place you’ve been in recently. Just being able to vaguely see the surroundings can help you grasp your position.
Ideally, it could be a place you used as a nighttime training ground until just yesterday. That’s exactly where Enkrid found himself now. Normally, this would be an unfamiliar place.
“This is...”
Normally, he would have been surprised to see it.
“Damn it.”
Normally, he would have despaired upon realizing the enemy's scale, but none of this applied to Enkrid. He had been here countless times already.
Not just visiting. He had rolled and fought here repeatedly. Each time, the people with him changed slightly but the basic composition remained the same.
Andrew, the rough-looking soldier, Enri, and the other squad members. Among them, the two thug-like squad members had been a significant help. The place they had exited was the reverse side of the tall grass field. An unexpected scene unfolded before them.
Some of the squad members thought the route back to the main unit was blocked, so this way must be a viable escape route. Enri especially thought so.
He had a good sense of direction, almost as good as the rough-looking soldier. He hadn’t been a plains hunter for nothing. Enri thought that since the enemy was ambushing in the grass, this side might be clear. He was wrong.
Which made it more hopeless.
Enri felt his legs give way.
Whoosh.
The first thing they saw was a burning torch. Then, they saw a large, thick tent partially obscuring the firelight. As soon as Enri saw it, he took a step back. When he lifted his head and widened his view, he could make out the structure.
It was a tent.
Why was there a tent here?
When he turned his head slightly in the faint light, he saw torches burning next to the tent. Lined up all the way down. Even a rough count showed more than ten.
The spacing between the torches was wide enough to barely see the surroundings. With the moonlight and torchlight mingling, their view cleared up. What they saw was tents.
At least more than twenty tents lined up along the tall grass field. This side was the opposite of the allied base.
Which meant the tents in front of them were the enemy, the Azpen Duchy's camp.
“Shit, what is this?”
One of the thug-like soldiers instinctively lowered his voice as he muttered.
“God, is this where we ended up?”
Enri’s voice was hollow with despair.
“Shh, quiet.”
The rough-looking soldier was the quickest to react. If they were discovered by the guards now, they would be in a fight. And if that happened, they would be killed instantly.
They could see more moving lights beyond the torches, indicating patrolling guards. Everyone knew without being told that the torches were held by sentries.
“Shut your mouths.”
The rough-looking soldier whispered, scanning the surroundings. A veteran’s experience shined in moments of crisis. He acted based on his experience. Lowering his stance, he tried to sense the presence of the sentries. He hid his body as much as possible, assessed the situation, and searched for an escape route. With luck, it could be possible.
It was night, and although not intended, they had moved in a direction far from the enemy’s expectations. They were deep in the enemy camp, close enough to touch the tents, but there was still a chance to escape if they weren’t detected.
He judged it could be done.
If you stay alert, you can survive even if you fall in the middle of a monster horde.
“Don’t draw your weapons. Stay low.”
He acted as if he were the leader. Most of the squad followed his orders except for two.
Naturally, one was Enkrid, and the other was Andrew.
“He must have a plan. Enkrid is the squad leader.”
Whether it was because he had been beaten up this morning and lost his position as squad leader, Andrew was the only one who supported Enkrid.
“This is no time for jokes.”
The rough-looking soldier turned his head while keeping his back bent. His voice was low but carried the force of a growling beast.
He was in a hurry. This was the heart of the enemy camp. Far more dangerous than facing an ambush in the tall grass. At any moment, an enemy spear could emerge from the tent. Thinking about it now was absurd.
The rough-looking soldier’s reaction was reasonable. In fact, Enkrid had often looked at this soldier and thought the same.
‘He’s no ordinary soldier.’
His skill, experience, judgment, and action were not at the level of a mere soldier. If Enkrid weren’t here, if he hadn’t repeated today. It would have been right to make this man the squad leader and struggle to survive.
But now, there was no need for that. The other squad members didn’t know, but everything up to this point had been according to Enkrid’s plan. The time, location, and place— everything.
How many nights had he spent here?
How many lives had he thrown away?
How many times had he repeated today?
In the tent ahead, three sluggish soldiers were fast asleep. There was still time before the patrolling soldiers would come around.
Knowing all this, Enkrid acted.
Shhhk.
He drew his sword and slashed the side of the tent. From bottom to top, the blade reflected the moonlight.
“This crazy bastard.”
The rough-looking soldier gasped and Andrew reacted to Enkrid’s actions.
He immediately dashed into the torn tent and stabbed the awakened enemy soldier in the neck with his shortsword.
Thud!
Enkrid followed him in. He held his sword to the throat of another soldier who was waking up and trying to grab the blade. Enkrid pressed the blade down, slitting the soldier’s throat.
Slice.
The sound of tearing leather filled the tent, soon followed by the smell of blood. The last enemy soldier was killed by one of the thug-like squad members who stabbed him in the heart with a dagger.
“Grk, grrrk.”
The soldier, stabbed in the heart, crawled on the ground, reaching out. He was a tenacious one. The torchlight from the tent entrance illuminated his reaching hand and above it cast a shadow.
It was the rough-looking soldier. He knelt on the enemy’s back, grabbed his neck, and twisted it.
Crack.
The soldier’s neck broke, and he died with his tongue hanging out.
“You.”
The rough-looking soldier’s eyes glowed in the dark. He glared at Enkrid. Lucky, otherwise they would have been surrounded and exterminated in the enemy camp. This was a gamble. To him, it looked like that.
“Move to the side.”
Enkrid ignored his glare. Before he could say anything, Enkrid extended his sword.
“You crazy bastard.”
The rough-looking soldier spoke in a low voice. His frustration and anger were evident. To him, this seemed like sheer madness. Enkrid slashed the side of the tent with his sword and turned his head slightly. He showed no concern that the soldier might attack him from behind.
Even with this tension?
Even in a situation where they were charging into an enemy camp with just a patrol unit, the atmosphere was so tense it felt like lightning crackling between them. Everyone watched the two of them cautiously.
“What’s your name?”
“What?”
“Your name.”
Maybe it was Enkrid’s calm demeanor. Maybe it was his boldness in the face of danger. The rough-looking soldier opened his mouth, answering Enkrid’s question while holding his sword and slashing down.
“Call me Mack.”
He didn’t withdraw his hostility. Enkrid turned his gaze from the soldier and said,
“Mack, I won’t accept disobedience.”
“What?”
Sliiiice.
Enkrid finished cutting through the tent and stepped out. The others had no choice but to follow.
“Phew, what the hell is going on?”
Mack muttered to himself and then made eye contact with Andrew.
“Yes, coming.”
Mack answered the look. They had to follow for now.
The next tent was empty. It seemed all the soldiers from the tent were out on night guard duty.
‘Does that make sense?’
The tent could accommodate at least ten soldiers. A minimum of a squad. With some effort, it could hold two squads. Judging by the traces inside, more than ten soldiers had been here.
“Forward.”
After passing through that tent, Enkrid didn’t even bother cutting the next tent. He peeked out the entrance, looked left and right, then dashed out.
The squad followed. By now, clouds had covered the moon. With only the torchlight, it was hard to see around. Even after blinking several times to adjust to the dark, it was pitch black. Enkrid moved forward without hesitation. Other than the sound of the squad’s breathing, there was no other noise.
“This way.”
A voice called out in the dark. It wasn’t a small voice. If there were enemies nearby, they could easily hear it. Mack felt a chill down his spine.
‘This bastard.’
But there was no sign of enemies. No unexpected movements. If there were, they would have already heard someone demanding to know who they were. Enkrid moved again.
By now, even Mack couldn’t tell the direction. In the tall grass field, the sun overhead made it easy to navigate, but now it was dark everywhere.
‘Does he know where he’s going?’
It seemed like he did. Enkrid’s steps showed no hesitation. He moved until he reached a tent with two torches standing close together. Then he stopped. Using a suitable tree as cover, Enkrid gestured to the squad behind him. In the dark, they could barely see his hand signals.
Mack felt like he was being led by a ghost.
‘How far have we walked?’
He wasn’t sure, but judging by the number of tents, it seemed like they had crossed through the entire enemy camp.
‘How haven’t we been caught?’
It felt surreal, like being under a spell.
“Wait here.”
Enkrid whispered as he turned around.
In the faint light, they saw four guards outside the tent. The enemy camp was eerily quiet at night, but this tent seemed busy.
Whoosh.
A breeze made the torchlight flicker, causing the guards' shadows to dance. Someone from inside the tent came out and spoke to the guards. Though they couldn’t hear the words, the guards nodded in response.
‘What are they guarding?’
Enkrid must have come for this. Finally, Mack began to understand the situation. No, he guessed it. A sudden realization struck him.
‘It’s a secret mission.’
A mission given solely to Enkrid, excluding the rest of the squad. It must have meant he had the commander’s trust. Mack remembered what Andrew had said. The company commander had ordered Enkrid to join them.
It all made sense now. Enkrid was on a secret mission.
‘So that’s what it was?’
It was a misunderstanding. Mack had a small epiphany but didn’t say it out loud. Even if Enkrid knew about this misunderstanding, he wouldn’t bother to explain. He had more urgent matters to attend to.
“We will set that tent on fire.”
Enkrid pointed. The tent had four guards at the front.
“Mack, take care of the guards on the left. Andrew, you handle the right. Enri, be ready with your bow. The rest, prepare to rush in.”
He gave the orders with calm authority. They had no choice but to comply. Mack felt a mix of frustration and reluctant respect. Enkrid was leading them through sheer willpower and competence.
The squad moved into position. Enkrid’s eyes were fixed on the tent.
It was time to execute his plan.
Chapter 31: Set It on Fire
‘It seems like setting tents on fire has become my specialty.’
Enkrid thought this as he clung to a tree, explaining the simple plan. None of the squad members added a word; they just listened. At this point, they were akin to arrows which had already been shot, following an inevitable path.
Enkrid soon moved.
“I’ll go first.”
He stepped quietly, making no noise. Eventually, he crouched and crawled on the ground.
The squad watched as Enkrid crawled. The plan was simple. Create a diversion on the east side and strike from the west. Mack and the remaining squad members were to create the noise. Enkrid, Andrew, and the ex-thug soldier were excluded from making noise.
“I’ll do it.”
Mack volunteered to draw the enemy’s attention without complaint. Mack’s sudden change in attitude didn’t surprise Enkrid. It was good to have a cooperative soldier.
Mack quietly stretched and picked up a stone, throwing it with force. The stone hit a guard on the head.
Thud!
The stone bounced off the helmet, and the guard yelped in pain.
“Damn it!”
“What’s going on?”
The four guards turned towards the noise. Enkrid held his breath, watching them.
Words were unnecessary.
“Intruder!”
A guard shouted, causing a commotion. Enkrid seized the moment to move closer to the tent but was spotted.
“Caught you, rat.”
He wasn’t surprised. He had learned from repeating this day many times.
‘I can’t do this alone.’
A spear-wielding soldier glared at him from beside the tent. Before the enemy could charge, Enkrid stood up, shaking the dirt off his chest. Without a war cry, the guard thrust his spear at Enkrid.
Enkrid watched the spear’s path closely and dodged.
But he didn’t just dodge. He gambled with half his life, trusting the heart of a beast to give him the boldness for this madness. As he dodged, he advanced. The spear grazed his shoulder, narrowly missing him. Heat flared from the scratch on his shoulder.
In return, Enkrid closed the distance. He slashed upward with his sword. The guard tried to block with his spear but Enkrid had hidden a knife in his left hand, stabbing it into the guard’s collarbone.
Thud!
Bone and flesh parted as the knife sank in.
“Ugh!”
The guard groaned. Enkrid headbutted the guard’s nose.
Thud!
The guard couldn’t even groan, collapsing backward. It was the Vallen mercenary sword technique, the Three Sword Style.
The first strike was a feint, with the real attack being the knife and headbutt. He had risked his life, charging at the spear to get close. He took down the guard.
But they had been discovered, and setting the tent on fire seemed impossible now. Behind the fallen guard, another soldier appeared with a torch and a sword.
The scarred man looked formidable. His gait and demeanor revealed he wasn’t a novice.
“Pathetic.”
He clicked his tongue. His steps were confident despite the ambush.
“Finally, it took you long enough.”
Enkrid muttered. The scarred man frowned at that.
Whoosh.
Behind the man, flames erupted. The tent was on fire.
“Put it out!”
The man shouted. Enkrid used this distraction to charge. He pushed off the ground with his right foot and planted his left foot firmly.
“Everything starts with the feet.”
Rem and Ragna, two of his squadmates, always emphasized this fundamental of swordsmanship.
Enkrid followed that advice. Pushing off the ground, he closed the distance quickly. In an instant, the man holding the torch and sword loomed large.
The man was looking back. His guard was down. Enkrid thrust his sword. With his whole body’s momentum behind it, he enacted the thrust that had killed him countless times.
Swoosh.
The blade cut through the air and reached its target. It was over in an instant. This was his best thrust ever. Of all the repetitions of today, this was the pinnacle. Enkrid believed he had killed the man.
In his heightened state of focus, time seemed to slow. Everything moved slowly— his sword and the man’s hand. In this slow world, the man’s hand moved. His sword shot up from below.
Thud!
Enkrid darted past the man, clutching his side. The man turned back around, raising an eyebrow at Enkrid.
“Arrogant bastard.”
The man looked furious. Anger was not the problem. The problem was his impressive sword skills.
‘In that moment?’
The thrust had been perfect. As perfect as could be. Even Rem would have struggled to block it with anything but his whip-like axe.
But this man had dodged it. Though he had a light cut on his neck, it was barely a scratch.
Meanwhile, the man’s counterattack had sliced Enkrid’s side. It wasn’t deep, and no bones were hit. He wouldn’t die from it, but...
‘I was overconfident.’
And yet, this was the result. Enkrid had repeated today countless times.
And still...
It felt like there was a vast river between him and the man. The man could easily cross the river to stab and cut him but Enkrid could only dip his toes in. There was a clear difference in skill.
So what could he do?
He had never fought only weaker opponents.
Enkrid steadied his breath and gripped his sword. If this was today’s turning point, he would give it his all. Despite the daunting difference in skill...
Nothing would change.
For others, a daunting gap might feel like despair, a cliff. For Enkrid, it felt like a staircase. A staircase he would climb one day. Thrilling excitement filled him from his toes to his chest.
How could repeating today be a curse?
He would eventually beat this formidable foe.
He would. He wouldn’t settle for today.
So he felt exhilarated. Enkrid’s feelings showed on his face.
“Are you laughing?”
The man’s face twisted in anger. Enkrid’s thrill was met with the man’s fury.
“I’ll tear you apart and feed you to the dogs.”
Enkrid sensed his impending death. He couldn’t win against this opponent now.
But he wouldn’t go down easily. Enkrid braced himself for pain. He did not retreat as he gripped his sword and steeled his resolve.
Whoosh.
Behind the man, the flames roared higher. It was as if a dragon was breathing fire. The entire tent caught fire.
Sparks flew everywhere. Desperate voices could be heard from the tent.
“You bastards! Put out the fire!”
“Someone poured oil, commander!”
“The torch stand fell!”
They were doing well. Enkrid had caused two distractions for this fire. Once with Mack and the squad and another with his body.
Andrew and the ex-thug soldier had set the fire. The ex-thug soldier had used his skills from when he caused trouble in the city.
“The flagpole is burning!”
Someone shouted from near the tent. A man with strange facial tattoos yelled.
“Commander! Do you not know what’s important now?”
He scolded the man facing Enkrid. Enkrid stepped back. Despite the skill difference, he wouldn’t die easily. The man knew this. Enkrid could hold out until the fire consumed the tent and flagpole. Enkrid didn’t know why the flagpole was so important.
He only knew one thing. It was valuable to the enemy. More so than the lives of a few soldiers.
“I’ll get you next time.”
The man, an Azpen squad commander, glared at Enkrid before turning away. He decided it was more urgent to deal with the arsonists than to fight Enkrid.
Enkrid sighed in relief. He felt like he had narrowly escaped death. Dying, no matter how many times he repeated today, was something he never got used to.
That was a curse. To face that terrible moment repeatedly. Of course, the pain and suffering were not Enkrid’s main concern.
As long as it helped him move forward. As long as it improved his skills.
Why wouldn’t he endure it?
“We need to go.”
While keeping watch, Andrew spoke up from behind. His face was covered in soot.
“Retreat.”
Enkrid commanded and moved. The ex-thug soldier followed. While running, Andrew pulled out a whistle and blew it.
Tweet, tweet!
Two long whistles, and Mack led the remaining squad members to them. Enri was bleeding from his arm, and there were no more soldiers following Mack. The squad of ten was now halved.
But Enkrid’s escape route had opened.
“The enemy is busy. There shouldn’t be a large-scale pursuit, right?”
Mack asked, implying this had been Enkrid’s goal. Mack’s forehead was bleeding, proving how tough their escape had been.
“Probably not.”
Enkrid replied, running.
Blood still flowed from his side. He thought the wound wasn’t deep, but without stopping the bleeding, it wouldn’t heal. For now, he just pressed his hand against it and ran. From now on, it was an unknown today, so Enkrid kept an eye on the rear. The enemy was hot on pursuit. Five soldiers chased them.
“Damn lunatics!”
They were relatively unscathed. Though their faces were sooty, they had no visible wounds. The five were enough for Enkrid, Andrew, and Mack.
Enri had a hole in his stomach, and he was stumbling, probably from blood loss. The squad's ex-thug soldier was supporting him, making it hard for him to fight properly.
“Damn it, we're all going to die at this rate! Get a grip!”
The ex-thug soldier scolded Enri, but he didn’t abandon him. Enkrid’s side wound worsened as he fought the pursuers. Still, he wouldn’t die from it.
Mack killed two of the pursuers, but in doing so, he got a gash on his thigh. He quickly wrapped it with a linen bandage and didn’t fall behind. Andrew seemed to have improved dramatically in just a few battles.
‘No, that’s not it.’
Enkrid realized Andrew hadn’t suddenly become skilled. The intense battlefield had brought out his latent abilities. Andrew’s fierce swordplay killed two pursuers quickly. Without that, they might not have escaped. Or it would have been much harder.
Andrew’s initial cheek wound had reopened, and blood was seeping through. They were all battered but still alive.
Following Enri’s lead, they ran through the night. Eventually, Enri, barely conscious, spoke up.
“If we head west from here, we’ll reach the plains where foxes and snakes live. They won’t chase us there.”
The Green Pearl plain was home to various wildlife, including foxes and snakes. However, there were many venomous snakes, making it dangerous.
“If we go there, we’ll get bitten by snakes before the enemy catches us.”
Mack said. Enri weakly smiled and replied.
“There’s a boundary where foxes and snakes overlap. I know it. It’s a hunter’s path.”
Enkrid looked at Enri, who was pale but smiling. Leading them while in that state was remarkable. Everyone looked at Enkrid for a decision.
“It’s that way.”
Enkrid moved without hesitation. He pondered other things as they ran.
‘That commander...’
The enemy commander’s image lingered in his mind. If that commander had appeared in earlier attempts, Enkrid would have been too busy dying.
But this was the first time.
Perhaps the situation had escalated to the point where the commander had to intervene.
‘Or maybe not.’
Now that he thought about it, he had heard that voice before.
During previous attempts, when he had snuck into the tent being guarded by soldiers, he had seen a strange scene.
Flags and poles. A basin with strange smoke, and a man with facial tattoos.
Was he doing some kind of ritual?
But the reaction had been too extreme.
“Catch him!”
The man had panicked when Enkrid kicked the pole. That’s when he realized the poles were significant. And then someone had slashed his neck from behind.
“What’s this guy?”
That voice seemed familiar. Lost in thought, Enkrid followed Enri’s lead until dawn.
The sky turned blue, signaling the start of a new day. They reached the recon base by morning. They were met by the recon squad leader.
“What the hell happened to you?”
The leader asked immediately. Enkrid knew there were more urgent matters to address than explaining. They had several wounded. They would report on the way back.
For now, surviving was enough.
“Phew, I’m going to pass out now.”
Enri said from behind. Enkrid didn’t reply.
There was no point in talking to someone who had already fainted.
Chapter 32: Dreams, Reproach, Responsibility
"How's the flagpole?"
"It's fine."
The company commander of the Azpen Duchy was not fond of the current operation but what could a mere commander do about orders from above?
If they command you to jump, you jump. That's exactly why he was jumping, and in the middle of it, a small problem arose. A few rats from Naurillia had infiltrated the camp and set it on fire. Even though more than half the troops were lying in ambush in the tall grass, the infiltration was successful.
No matter how displeased he was, the operation had already started. Being caught off guard here would be a stain on their pride. Failure was absolutely unacceptable.
"You should have been more thorough in your defenses."
The owner of the flagpole spoke. The commander's forehead veins bulged at the remark. It was infuriating to hear this chatter from someone whose neck could be sliced off with one sword stroke. But what could he do?
There was indeed a breach in the unit's perimeter.
"Yes, I understand."
Flap!
With that, the company commander pushed open the tent door and stepped outside. He couldn't comprehend the situation.
'Does this make any sense?'
The enemy detecting their presence? Sure, that could happen. But then what?
Attacking the main base's flagpole with less than ten men after bypassing the troops in the tall grass? The company commander trusted his unit. It was natural.
His nickname was the "Demon Commander" because of his brutal training methods.
He believed that coughing up blood during training would prevent them from coughing up blood and dying on the battlefield. This was the unit he had trained.
'They got through this?'
A soldier who loses a battle can still be a soldier, but a soldier who fails at guarding cannot be. The commander sincerely believed this.
So, should he blame his own troops' negligence?
That couldn't be done indiscriminately. The one who planned and executed this was not ordinary. To infiltrate enemy territory with a small group, to survive a clash with his subordinates, and to set a fire and escape perfectly. Even if his platoon leader had to let them go due to the spreading fire.
'Luck is also a skill.'
The Azpen company commander, who had roamed the battlefield for a long time, understood the importance of luck. The commander turned to his waiting squad leader.
"Summon all the officers except the platoon leader on duty."
"Yes, sir."
His company was under the battalion's command but had its own operational authority. So it was an independent company. And usually, independent companies had nicknames.
This unit was called the "Gray Hound."
In the Azpen Duchy, gray hounds were known for their relentless nature, characterized by their gray fur.
Gray hounds were famous for their persistence in connecting with their targets, whether for love or combat. Because of this, the Gray Hound unit was also known as "Persistent Lovers."
Now, the unit's commander had chosen an unknown enemy scout leader as his target.
'I will catch and kill them without fail.'
The Gray Hound, the gray-furred dog, had set its sights.
The commander repeatedly etched his resolve ontohis chest. He would definitely capture and destroy them. Above him, clouds began to gather, possibly due to the shaman's work inside the tent. It seemed like it would rain soon. The recent rains were mostly the work of the shaman inside the tent, and this very shaman was the key to this tactic.
Although he disliked it, there was no denying that it was an efficient operation. If this operation were utterly senseless, the independent company of the Gray Hound, or the "Persistent Lovers," would never have participated.
Victory was promised on this battlefield. Apart from his burning desire for revenge, he found it extremely dull.
"Accidentally discovered the enemy's ambush, then accidentally infiltrated their main camp, and accidentally set their camp on fire?"
When said like that, it sounded odd indeed. Enkrid added some context instead of nodding.
"Yes, I believed it was the appropriate action at the time, and it just happened by chance."
The reconnaissance platoon leader blinked.
What was this guy saying?
He was about the same age but had become a squad leader by sheer luck. Skill-wise, he was pathetic, swinging his sword at any opportunity. That was the external evaluation of the troublemaker squad leader.
But listening to what he had done, it was something else. Even hearing it from Enkrid's mouth, it was astonishing. The surviving squad members' stories were even more outrageous.
"Rumors can't be trusted. If possible, I'd like to learn more from you."
Andrew, who had been too arrogant before he left, was now respectful. He had been worried about sending this guy away, fearing an accident. The command of the recon squad was forcibly taken away, and it seemed justified. No, he wanted to learn more.
Was this really the Andrew he knew?
"From what I see, your skills surpass those of an intermediate soldier."
Next was Mack, Andrew's guardian.
The recon platoon leader knew Mack's skills. He had partly entrusted Andrew to the recon squad because of his faith in Mack. And now Mack recognized Enkrid’s skill. All because of his abilities.
"I followed his orders, and this is the result."
The last was Enri, the plains hunter.
The evaluations from the squad members were unanimous. They just trusted and followed him. They wouldn't all lie together. So this was the reality. Enkrid had seized command of the reconnaissance squad.
With less than ten men, they had bypassed the enemies lying in ambush in the tall grass, set the enemy camp on fire, and returned alive.
'Does this make sense?'
It didn't seem so, but they had already set the fire and assessed the enemy's movements, so there was nothing more to say. Organizing all he had heard, he felt bewildered. Somehow, they had moved through the enemy camp without being noticed.
"Well, um, you must have been incredibly lucky."
In the end, the recon platoon leader could only say this. Enkrid thought the statement was appropriate. He couldn't exactly explain that he memorized the enemy's movements and camp layout because today repeated itself every time he died.
"Yes, I was lucky."
If this was luck, it was extraordinary. The level where the goddess of fortune not only kissed but slept with him. However, there was no other explanation besides luck. So rumors began to circulate within the recon squad.
That the troublemaker squad leader Enkrid was a man of luck, that the goddess of fortune had left her coin with him, that he was fortune itself. Or that he had used up all his lifetime's luck in this reconnaissance mission.
The return journey to the main camp was uneventful. It only drizzled briefly during the half-day walk. Rain fell from a clear sky. It was rare, but it happened occasionally.
And throughout the return, Enkrid was preoccupied with one thought.
'Was that the best I could do?'
A question he asked himself. If he had repeated "today" several times, could he have achieved a different outcome?
No matter the task, regrets linger. Enkrid had known this since he was young. What mattered was the choice and the process of making that choice.
'I thought it was the best choice.'
Repeating today made him think differently.
Was it really the best? Doubts and uncertainties arose, wondering if there could have been another option.
'Only four.'
That was the number of survivors. Including himself, there were five. Half of the squad had died. The results posed a question to Enkrid.
Was this the best outcome? Was there no other way?
'Five died.'
They were neither his family nor his friends. They were just squad members he had briefly worked with. Their presence or absence didn't change anything. They were simply his responsibility at that moment, on that day. The dream he had harbored for so long, the conviction that had guided him thus far, reproached him.
Was this really the best you could do?
Couldn't you have saved more?
'What kind of knight do you intend to become?'
Enkrid, as a boy, had been captivated by the mere notion of a knight. The idea of a knight, as sung by minstrels, had enchanted the boy who had grown up to become a man.
As time passed, Enkrid realized his talents were insignificant. Rolling through battlefields, he understood his limits.
Yet, he never abandoned his dream.
Even if that dream had become a tattered piece of leather. Even if it had been torn and shredded by the reality of a knife, he had never given up.
Thus, he could avoid ending as just someone captivated by the word "knight." A knight was a protector, a leader, someone who embodied their beliefs.
'What kind of knight do I want to be?'
By repeating today, Enkrid had stepped beyond his limits. If so, he should adhere to what he had seen, heard, realized, and established through his own eyes and ears.
'What kind of knight do I aspire to be?'
His torn and shredded dream, now a conviction, reproached him. Enkrid accepted the reproach.
By doing so, he decided to let go of the past. Even if repeating today could have saved five more, it was already done. That "today" had ended. Dwelling on it was foolish.
"The main camp is in sight."
One of the soldiers walking with him spoke.
"Phew, we're alive."
Enri, who had been supported from behind, murmured.
"So, are you going to run straight to that widow florist when we get back?"
"We can go after this battle ends, can't we?"
Enri spoke with a joyous expression.
Surviving and returning from such perilousness filled his heart with joy. The same feeling was shared by others. Especially the thug-turned-soldier. He had been reflecting on the whole incident throughout the journey.
How exactly had he survived?
He had expected to die living as a thug but somehow ended up serving in the military and somehow he ended up serving under Enkrid. This reconnaissance mission had given him much to ponder.
The thug soldier, still limping from his injured leg, approached Enkrid. It wasn't intentional, but he hadn't spoken a word the entire journey.
"One who doesn't repay a favor isn't a human being."
It was a saying his older brother, who had taken care of him, used to say. That brother had long since died, but the words had become his guiding principle. Even though he had lived a carefree and rough life, the thug understood gratitude.
"I apologize for my insolence. I will repay the debt of saving my life when I get the chance."
