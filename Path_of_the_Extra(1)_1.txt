After a tragic accident that claimed the lives of his parents and little sister, Leo, just 17 years old, found himself shouldering all responsibilities alone. By some miracle, he survived the past four months on his own—attending high school, juggling multiple part-time jobs, and enduring sympathetic gazes that pained him. The only respite he found was in books, which offered him an escape and some semblance of joy. One day, while engrossed in the book 'Path of Heroes: Battle Against the End,' his life took an unexpected turn. Halfway through the story, he inexplicably found himself transmigrated into the world of Path of Heroes, inhabiting the body of Azriel Crimson—a character never mentioned in the story's first half. An extra. Someone seemingly irrelevant to the plot. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—fate had other plans, and Leo soon discovered that being a mere extra was not his destiny after all. -------------------------------------- Character illustrations will be available on Discord.

Chapter 31: Christmas Banquet [1]
Today was December 25.

It was Christmas Day.

More than two months had passed since Azriel had made it back to the Crimson estate and after the White Haven event.

He and Nol had barely survived his mother's wrath.

Not that Azriel didn't understand her anger.

Suddenly disappearing in perhaps one of the safest places on Earth after just returning from being presumed dead for the past two years...

Of course, his mother would be worried.

As for Nol...

He had been staying at the Crimson estate ever since.

His family, especially his mother and sister, had taken quite a liking to him, treating Nol as family.

Both Azriel and Nol came up with a simple story that Nol was a friend Azriel had made in the void realm, where Nol had lost all his memories, making him know almost nothing about Earth and his own life there.

Somehow Nol had found himself trapped in his own unique skill, forgetting how to use it, making Azriel think he died, so he escaped the void realm without him.

But after finally finding out how, Nol managed to send an invitation to Azriel at the Crimson estate.

At first, Azriel was still suspicious of Nol, but after living with him day after day, he noticed that the boy wouldn't do him or his family any harm.

In fact, it seemed Nol would be the one to harm those who dared to even have such thoughts against his master and his family.

In these two months, Azriel unfortunately couldn't really train much.

The reason?

"I think this one suits him the best, don't you think so, Mother?"

"Yes, I agree. This one makes his eyes stand out much more!"

The mother-daughter pair behind him treated him like a dress-up doll.

They had barely left Azriel's side since the White Haven incident.

Who knows where he might disappear to when left on his own again?

Or better said, with his father.

It seemed that every time the father-son pair were together, Azriel would somehow manage to disappear.

In other words, they didn't really trust Azriel and Joaquin to be left together anymore.

Not that Azriel minded that much...

If he was honest, he had missed the feeling of having people worry over him.

... it felt nice.

Though he was still a little annoyed that they didn't allow him to train.

But that was one of the conditions for being allowed to go to the hero academy.

It was a hassle to persuade his mother since she didn't favor the idea of Azriel leaving the Crimson estate.

Luckily, his father and sister managed to help him out, though the former almost lost his life...

Again.

Only a week was left until the academy would start.

It's not like Azriel really needed to prepare for it.

Currently, his mother and sister were with him in his room.

After changing clothes for the umpteenth time, he had finally settled on a black tuxedo and adjusted his collar properly.

His hair was combed back as well.

Jasmine and his mother nodded at each other, seemingly proud of themselves.

Both of them were sitting on his bed, and as he gazed at the pile of clothes next to them...

His lips twitched.

More than half of them couldn't even be worn today!

'I feel used... not even being in Europe was this tiring!'

Even in this world, Christmas was celebrated.

In fact, it was even more significant than in his previous world, as it symbolized the hope that humanity was still standing.

Each year, the four great clans of Asia would host a banquet.

A Christmas banquet, to be precise.

This year, it was Azriel's family's turn to host.

His sister, Jasmine, was wearing a sleek black dress that hugged her figure, with a high neckline and long sleeves.

The fabric shimmered subtly in the light, cascading down to a modest length just above her knees.

Their mother, Aeliana, wore a similar dress, but hers was red instead of black.

Azriel understood why the protagonist was captivated by Jasmine. Her beauty was simply enchanting, a magnetic force that could draw everyone in.

Even as her brother, Azriel couldn't help but be in awe of her breathtaking appearance. She had a quality that seemed to set her apart from everyone else.

And then there was their mother, whose beauty was on an entirely different level. She possessed elegance and grace that seemed almost otherworldly.

'Still, he's not getting her...'

Not that he had anything against the protagonist. In fact, Azriel liked him a lot.

Sure, he had flaws like every other person, but one of his most irritating flaws was his harem.

'It's not like he has a harem right now, though...'

Perhaps he could change that?

Make the protagonist someone who would stick to one person?

Azriel shook his head.

'I don't have time to waste on that.'

Instead, he would just intervene if he noticed him and Jasmine getting closer.

"Both of you can go downstairs. I'll find you after I see what's taking Nol so long."

His mother frowned a little at Azriel's words.

"Are you sure? It has been a while since you attended something like this..."

Azriel smiled, hearing her concern. He could see Jasmine looking at him, also a little worried.

Azriel was someone who almost never attended banquets.

This would also be the first time Azriel Crimson would reappear in public, dispelling all the rumors that had been going around about him for the past two years.

"Perhaps it's better if I stay with you and Nol...?"

Hearing his sister, Azriel shook his head.

"There is no need. Seriously, both of you are worrying too much. I promise I will be fine. Besides, it's about to start, and I'm sure Father is waiting downstairs already."

It would be odd if his mother and sister were late. As for Azriel, it wasn't like anyone was expecting him anyway, so he could afford to be a little later than them.

"Fine... just make sure to stay with Nol if you aren't joining us. Otherwise, find us if something happens."

Luckily, his mother relented this time, making Azriel break out in a small smile.

"I doubt something will happen, but I promise I will find you if it does."

Who was he kidding?

Of course, trouble would happen!

In fact, Azriel was counting on it.

This Christmas banquet would be...

'The perfect chance to change Azriel Crimson's image.'

Chapter 32: Christmas Banquet [2]
Crystal chandeliers hung from the high, vaulted ceiling, each one dripping with hundreds of glittering prisms that cast a cool, silver light over the room.

The walls were adorned with sleek, silver panels, etched with delicate patterns that seemed to come alive in the flickering candlelight.

Large, ornately framed mirrors hung between the panels, reflecting the grandeur of the space and making it seem even larger.

The floor was a gleaming expanse of polished marble, inlaid with swirling patterns of onyx and silver.

Everywhere you looked, there were fresh flowers – roses, lilies, and orchids in every imaginable color – arranged in tall, vases that stood on pedestals of carved mahogany.

Long banquet tables, draped in heavy white linen, were laden with silver platters of the finest foods.

At the center of each table, candelabras of polished silver held thick, white candles that burned steadily, their flames dancing in the air.

The guests themselves were a dazzling sight, each one dressed in the height of fashion.

Men in tailored tuxedos and women in glittering gowns moved gracefully around the room, their laughter and conversation a pleasant hum that filled the space.

Waiters in crisp, white uniforms moved seamlessly among the guests, carrying trays of champagne and canapés.

At one end of the ballroom, a grand piano stood, its black lacquered surface reflecting the room's light.

A pianist played softly, the music dancing through the conversations and adding elegance to the atmosphere.

Amidst the crowd, a young woman captivated nearly everyone's attention.

Her silver hair cascaded down her back in soft waves, catching the light from the chandeliers and shimmering like a waterfall of molten metal.

She wore a dress that matched the room's cool elegance, a flowing gown of shimmering silver that clung to her figure and flared out gently as it reached the floor.

Her eyes were a striking shade of grey, clear and piercing, framed by long, dark lashes that fluttered with every blink.

Her lips, tinted with a hint of red, curled into a delicate smile that sent shivers through the hearts of every young man in the room.

Not a single person in the room was unaware of her identity.

She was the Princess of the great Frost Clan.

Celestina Frost.

And soon-to-be elder sister.

"Congratulations, Celestina. I'm certain you'll make a wonderful elder sister."

"Thank you," Celestina replied, her voice like the chiming of a silver bell, resonant and enchanting.

"Though I must admit, I'm hoping for a little sister rather than a brother."

Celestina's smile remained gentle as she spoke.

If Azriel were to hear this, he might question his grasp on reality even more than he already did.

After all...

There had been no mention in the book of Celestina's mother being pregnant.

Which meant that Azriel's survival had somehow added another member to the Frost Clan.

How exactly had that happened?

Perhaps it would be best if he never asked Ragnar.

"Right? Having a little brother will honestly just make you worry all the time. I can't count the number of times Azriel almost drove me crazy."

Hearing Jasmine's words, Celestina's smile froze.

'Azriel...?'

Why would she suddenly say his name?

It wasn't just Celestina who looked at Jasmine in shock; Caleus Nebula, the Prince of the Nebula Clan, who was the same age as the Princess of the Crimson Clan, shared the same astonished expression.

His amethyst hair shimmered under the chandelier light, matching his striking violet eyes that held the depth of galaxies.

Both knew about Azriel being dead.

Every single member of the four great clans knew of it.

What caught them off guard was that Jasmine normally never spoke of him since his death.

Ever.

Celestina respected Jasmine immensely. The Princess of the Frost Clan aspired to be a pillar of humanity, a hero, and saw the Crimson Princess as a rival she needed to surpass.

Who wouldn't think like that?

Jasmine Crimson, who would likely be the strongest second-year student just as she had been in her first year, had already set her sights on becoming the student council president and was destined to be the next head of the Crimson Clan.

She was an obstacle that, in Celestina's eyes, needed to be overcome.

But she still considered Jasmine a friend.

Given their high statuses, there weren't many people Celestina could interact with without worry.

Jasmine was someone she admired and regarded as a friend, unlike her little brother, whom she never knew how to talk to.

Azriel always seemed lost in his own world.

She wanted to ask why Jasmine had mentioned Azriel, but she felt it would be inappropriate.

Maybe it was just a slip of the tongue?

Caelus and Celestina exchanged a fleeting glance, and in that brief moment of understanding, they silently agreed to let it pass.

"Speaking of the devil, where the hell is he...? He's already half an hour late. If he shows up now, it will become quite troublesome..."

Both Celestina and Caelus grew even more puzzled by Jasmine's mumbling.

'...has she finally lost it?'

"Jasmine, are you feeling alright?"

Caelus asked with concern, causing Jasmine to snap out of her daze and look at him with wide eyes.

"Ah, yes, I'm fine. Sorry about that,"

Jasmine replied, though Caelus remained unconvinced.

"Are you sure? If you're feeling unwell, perhaps we should—"

Suddenly, his words trailed off as he noticed something unusual.

It wasn't just him—everyone in the ballroom had fallen silent.

The music had abruptly stopped, and the chatter had ceased as if the sound had been abruptly cut off.

'What's happening...?'

Celestina, though not overly worried, found the sudden silence strange.

'A special event, perhaps?' she wondered.

Step—!

A single, thunderous step echoed through the ballroom, drawing everyone's attention to the entrance.

Heads snapped towards the entrance, their gasps echoing off the walls.

What they saw…

"!?"

Left them trembling.

'H-how…!?'

Celestina could hardly believe her eyes.

No one did.

Standing there was the prince who was thought to have died—the one who had fallen in battle against the Void.

He stood tall and commanding, his posture impeccable and resolute, radiating an aura of confidence and strength that seemed almost otherworldly.

Every gaze in the room was locked on him, their faces a mix of astonishment and bewilderment.

Step—!

Each step he took resonated through the space like distant thunder, rendering the crowd spellbound and motionless.

He wore a black tuxedo that melded seamlessly with his dark hair, enhancing the striking contrast of his crimson-red eyes.

Those eyes were like pools of liquid fire, burning with an intensity that was both mesmerizing and disquieting.

Behind him, another figure in a pristine white tuxedo stood slightly in the background, his presence barely noticed.

Yet, his silver hair and matching crimson-red eyes oddly hinted at a striking resemblance to the crimson prince.

The subtle sheen of his silver locks caught the light, adding an otherworldly quality to his appearance.

Yet, it was the prince in black who held the room's undivided attention.

Step—!

.

.

Step—!

.

.

Step—!

.

.

Step—!

.

.

Step—!

.

.

Celestina recalled Jasmine's earlier words.

.

.

Step—!

.

.

He continued to walk calmly through the crowd, their disbelief evident in every eye.

.

.

Step—!

.

.

Until...

.

.

Step—!

.

.

He finally stopped.

.

.

Standing in the center of the ballroom.

His crimson eyes, so intense they were almost unrecognizable, swept over the assembled guests.

Suddenly, his gaze locked with hers.

Ba... Thump!

Celestina's heart skipped a beat as their eyes met for a fleeting moment.

He was the first to break the connection, turning his gaze to his sister, who regarded him with narrowed eyes.

Azriel's lips curved into a soft, knowing smile.

Ba... Thump!

Celestina felt her heart skip a beat once more, this time with the impact of his smile.

And she wasn't alone.

More than half of the guests felt their hearts quicken at that smile.

"All of you are looking at me like I'm some sort of ghost—"

His voice was soft, yet it effortlessly carried across the room.

"—Why? Today is Christmas, after all... the day of miracles."

With that, he moved towards a nearby waiter, who visibly paled upon his approach.

Azriel casually took a glass of red wine from the tray, as if nothing unusual had happened.

"I'm sure you have many questions about me. Where have I been all this time? Did I die? Was I disowned? Did I run away?"

He addressed each of the rumors that had been circulating about him with a calm smile.

"The truth is, I wasn't dead, disowned, or fleeing. Instead, I..."

The crowd leaned in, hanging on his every word, until he abruptly turned his gaze toward someone.

Celestina, along with everyone else, followed his stare and saw him looking at his father.

Joaquin Crimson, flanked by Ragnar on his left and Aeliana, his wife, on his right, watched with approving smiles.

Joaquin gave a nod of acknowledgment.

"For the past two years, I was in the Void Realm."

"...!"

Chapter 33: Christmas Banquet [3]
All the guests fell into a deeper silence upon hearing his words. Their minds were still grappling with the revelation Azriel had just shared.

Feeling the weight of every gaze upon him made Azriel uncomfortable, though he didn't show it.

He couldn't afford to break now. He had to play his role perfectly.

The role of Azriel Crimson, the prince who survived the Void Realm on his own.

The role he had been acting for the past two months without a break.

It had reached the point where he was beginning to believe his own lies.

But...

He couldn't allow himself to get lost in the role. Every day, he reminded himself that as much as he was Azriel Crimson, he was also Leo Karumi.

He couldn't lose that part of himself.

Not yet.

In front of every eye in the room, it took everything he had not to make a single mistake.

A single mistake was all it would take for the strongest here to notice something odd.

He couldn't afford that.

Everything had to be perfect.

The way he carried himself, spoke, looked, and moved—there couldn't be a single flaw.

Also...

His gaze shifted towards Solomon, who sat at one of the tables, watching him with excitement.

'It looks like he got his wish in the end, huh...'

He recalled Solomon's desire for Azriel to reveal himself back at the military base.

His wish had come true.

His gaze shifted to a woman standing next to him, and Azriel found himself momentarily breathless.

Her black obsidian hair cascaded in sleek waves, perfectly complementing the elegant black dress she wore. Her rose-colored eyes, striking and vibrant, contrasted sharply with her pale, porcelain skin.

Her face was stoic, her eyes betraying almost no emotion as they locked with his.

Almost…

He could detect a glimmer of curiosity hidden deep within her gaze.

'Freya Selene…'

The headmistress of the Hero Academy.

A Grade 1 Saint.

Azriel allowed a brief, soft smile to form on his lips—a smile that only he, Solomon, and Freya fully understood.

'All is still going according to my plan.'

For now.

Even though he hadn't been able to train physically for the past two months, he hadn't been idle.

He had been meticulously planning using his knowledge of the book, just as he had strategized with Solomon back in the café.

But…

'Always expect the unexpected. I can't rely solely on my plans. There's a high chance something will go wrong. No, with my luck, which matches the protagonist's, something will definitely go wrong.'

He was certain of that.

His luck, as Leo and Azriel combined, matched or perhaps even surpassed that of the protagonist.

Finally, he turned his attention back to the other guests, surveying them with a composed and confident demeanor.

And so...

Azriel's lips parted.

"When I was in the Void Realm, it reminded me of a story I once read."

It was a story Leo's mother had told.

He made sure his voice was soft yet powerful enough to reach every ear in the room.

Everyone listened intently, even his family, who had not heard a single word about his time in the Void Realm, nor had they asked.

Naturally, they were focused on every word he spoke.

"It was about a little boy who found himself in a land of unimaginable horror. Picture a place where the sky is perpetually black, and the air is thick with the stench of rot and death. A land where the trees were twisted, gnarled hands reaching out to snatch anything that dared come close. Every shadow hid unspeakable terrors."

His words were met with confused stares, as though he were recounting a child's fairy tale.

Which...

He was.

"This boy was utterly alone. His family... they were gone, consumed by the very horrors that now stalked him relentlessly."

Despite its origins as a children's story, Azriel found himself connected to it, perhaps because, like the boy, he had lost his family once.

"But he kept going. He had to. He built a fragile shelter from debris, barely enough to fend off the biting cold, but it was something. Every meal was a desperate scavenging mission, living off scraps that barely kept him alive."

A hint of emotion crept into his voice, recalling the time he had to struggle for every meal as Leo.

"And every night, he lay awake, listening to the monsters outside, their claws scratching and growling, trying to get in. Yet, he held on, clinging to a fragile thread of hope."

"One day, amidst the rubble, he found an old, tattered book. It was a storybook, filled with tales of heroes and bravery, so out of place in that nightmarish world."

His gaze swept through the room once more, eventually meeting Celestina's. She, like the others, was now listening with rapt attention.

This made Azriel smile wider.

"He read it over and over, drawing strength from those stories, imagining himself as one of those heroes. In the darkest moments, when he felt like surrendering to the darkness, he'd think about those heroes and their courage, how they never gave in no matter how dire the situation."

He paused, taking a deep breath.

"He survived. Emerging from that land of horror battered and scarred, but alive, with a heart that still beat with hope."

Some looked at him with confusion, not yet grasping the meaning behind the tale, while others were beginning to understand.

"And do you know why that boy survived?"

"Was it sheer willpower? Was it a miracle? Or was it simply the indomitable human spirit—the part of us that refuses to be crushed no matter how horrible things get?"

"...!"

Everyone in the room looked at him with wide eyes.

"The answer to that question is all of it. We humans will do anything to survive. Every obstacle, every challenge, only fuels our fire. When pushed to the edge, we don't just adapt—we evolve, we conquer, we blaze a trail where there was none before."

"...."

"Just like the boy, I have survived a land of unimaginable horror… the Void Realm. In my time there, I learned one extremely important thing."

He paused, letting the weight of his words build as every gaze remained fixed on him in anticipation.

"The strong devour the weak."

In the Void Realm, if you were weaker than your opponent, you were as good as dead. It was as simple as that.

Ragnar was right—being weak was a sin, both in this world and in the Void Realm.

"Of course, I've learned other things as well, but strength is what matters most in both worlds. If we humans remain weak, the Void will consume us. And so... I will be joining the Hero Academy."

"!!"

A fresh wave of shock swept through the room, all except for those closest to him who already understood the implications.

Azriel was widely known for being the only prince who had never trained to become a hero. The idea of him joining the Hero Academy was normally unexpected, to say the least.

A mischievous smile tugged at his lips as he glanced at his sister, who was already glaring at him.

'Looks like she's already figured it out, huh… Sorry, but even I need to stretch my legs.'

He mentally apologized to his sister as he prepared to address the room.

"It seems my sudden appearance has cast a shadow over this joyous party… how about we brighten things up? The Academy is about to start, and since there are some students, or soon-to-be students here, I have a proposal."

He lifted his glass of wine, which he had not yet touched, and raised it for everyone to see.

"Let's have some duels!"

Chapter 34: Christmas Banquet [4]
"I should have known... you were trouble itself."

Azriel suppressed a chuckle hearing his sister grumbling.

He was standing next to Celestina and Caleus, watching the room being readjusted for the duels.

Nol, meanwhile, was enjoying himself, talking to guests and indulging in the food.

Just like Azriel, Nol hadn't had many opportunities to leave the Crimson estate, and his curiosity about the world was evident.

Varied gazes were directed at Azriel, making him want to run away; it was extremely nerve-wracking, but necessary.

All that was left was this duel, and he would finally be done for the night.

'No, that's wrong...'

He glanced at Freya and Solomon, who were talking to each other.

'If after all of this, she still isn't on board, it will become troublesome.'

Everything he had done was to convince Freya to agree to Azriel and Solomon's plan.

Even his lateness had been intentional—or rather, not entirely.

Azriel had planned to be late to the party, but it turned out Nol had genuinely struggled to wear his tuxedo and had refused help from the servants.

'Still, it worked in my favor... though I'm sure Mom will be mad.'

For some reason, his parents had decided to leave the banquet with Ragnar.

'Speaking of parents...'

"The Nebula and Dusk clans didn't join us, Caelus?"

Azriel turned his attention to Caleus, who was staring at him intently, just as Celestina was.

"...They haven't. My parents and the Dusk clan have decided to cooperate with each other and deal with the sudden issues that have arisen in Europe over the past few months."

Hearing his answer, Azriel nodded, his thoughts racing.

'To think my survival changed so much in Europe...'

"Can I ask you a question...?"

'Hmm?'

Azriel looked at Caleus, who had a complex expression on his face.

"It's true that you were in the Void Realm all along for the past two years, right?"

"That is right," Azriel nodded calmly.

"Then... what is your mana core level now?"

The people who were sneakily listening nearby strained their ears, and even Jasmine was looking at him curiously.

Not once had Azriel revealed his rank to her or his parents, nor did they ask.

'He is curious, huh... not just him,'

Azriel thought, feeling Celestina's piercing stare from his side, almost making his cheek twitch.

'Good...'

Azriel smiled.

"If you are that curious, why don't you find out for yourself?"

Caleus and everyone else looked at him, wide-eyed in surprise.

"You really have changed a lot..."

'Of course I have... the old Azriel died.'

Surprised though he was, Caleus nodded firmly in the end.

"Very well, I shall be your partner. But be warned, I am a Grade 2 Intermediate already. Show me the you who survived the Void Realm on his own, Azriel Crimson."

A fire was now burning in his violet eyes.

Jasmine didn't stop him or Azriel, knowing it was pointless.

Though she did look worried, it wasn't as if they would be fighting to the death.

The rules were simple: no affinities, no sword arts and no skills. The first one to be knocked unconscious or surrender would lose.

"I wish to fight you as well, but..."

Azriel heard a soft murmur and turned to see Celestina.

She pouted slightly, her eyes glistening with disappointment, and her cheeks flushed a gentle pink.

'A-argh! Dammit, how can she look so cute!'

Azriel almost broke character.

'I can see why he fell for her... those eyes...'

They were so bright and innocent!

Ragnar was right to say she had a line of boys willing to become her boyfriend.

She was just that beautiful!

One of the hardest parts of keeping his composure for Azriel was enduring the gazes of all these people who could be compared to goddesses in his previous world.

'Calm down...'

Taking a deep breath inwardly, Azriel spoke to Celestina.

"It would be rude of me to fight a lady while she is wearing such a beautiful dress..."

"O-oh..."

Both Jasmine and Celestina looked wide-eyed at Azriel, who turned away, scratching his cheek.

"But..."

A soft smile appeared on his face as he looked back at her.

"Once we are both in the academy, I will have a duel with you whenever you want."

Celestina didn't say anything, just stared at him.

'T-that didn't sound weird, did it...? Does she think of me as a creep now?'

Azriel wondered, feeling a pang of anxiety.

'Argh! No point thinking about it; the duel is finally about to start...'

Azriel and Caleus finally moved towards the center while everyone gazed at them in anticipation.

The atmosphere was charged with excitement and curiosity.

The Crimson Prince against the Nebula Prince—this duel was already legendary before it even began.

*****

The guests formed a cautious circle around Azriel and Caleus, careful to give them ample space. No referee was needed for these duels.

They could begin whenever they chose.

Azriel summoned Void Eater, gripping it tightly in his right hand.

Across from him, Caleus twirled his silver spear with fluid grace, its long reach a stark contrast to the close-quarters lethality of Azriel's katana.

They stood still, each waiting for the other to make the first move.

'This is insane...'

Azriel could hardly believe he was here, facing off against a prince from one of the four great clans.

Every action he'd taken today seemed utterly surreal.

No, not just today.

Ever since arriving in EASC, he'd been living a reality that once existed only in his imagination.

He still hadn't adjusted to the fact that he was in a world he'd once only read about.

The weight of every gaze on him felt surreal.

They didn't know... they didn't know how much they truly meant to Azriel.

No, not Azriel, but...

Leo.

The kid who had lost his family.

The only reason he had survived those dark days was because of these people, standing here now.

Not just them, but the protagonist—the one who inspired him to hold on.

They were one of the most important reasons he had made it through.

Since arriving in EASC and the Crimson Estate, one thought kept running through Azriel's mind:

What was he going to do now?

What was his goal?

Was a coffee shop really all he wanted?

'No...'

It wasn't.

He didn't want that.

This world might actually fill the hole inside him.

How could he just settle for a coffee shop?

But being a hero wasn't something he could become either.

Sure, he could join the academy, be a hero in name, but he would never be a true hero.

That wasn't who Azriel—or Leo—was.

He couldn't walk the path of a hero.

'I can never shine as bright as them...'

He could never be as pure as them, have such resolve, such dreams, and...

'I am not worthy...'

He wasn't worthy of being a hero.

So instead...

He would ensure they became even greater heroes, even if they resented him for it, even if their path became more dangerous.

He would do it all to help them reach their dreams, to shine as bright as stars.

Everyone around them watched the two with bated breath.

Azriel narrowed his eyes slightly at Caleus.

And then...

'[Void Mind]'

Chapter 35: Christmas Banquet [5]
Celestina's eyes were glued to the two princes standing in the middle of the ballroom.

There was no sound coming from anywhere, only utter silence.

'Caleus was right...he has changed.'

A lot.

The old Azriel would have never done everything he had done today.

It wasn't just that which surprised her.

The thing that surprised her the most was...

'He complimented me...'

It wasn't like getting complimented was something that shook her heart or made it flutter.

Celestina had received compliments from countless people already, so she had gotten used to it.

What shocked her the most was that 'he' was the one who complimented her.

As far as she could remember, Azriel would never compliment anyone.

Hell, he would barely even talk to her or Caleus as if he wasn't interested.

The air around him always seemed to say to stay away from him.

He was always someone who distanced himself from everyone around him.

But now?

It was like he was almost a different person.

Celestina didn't mean to speak out her desire to fight him as well.

It was just a thought that accidentally leaked out, which Azriel heard.

Yet he didn't ignore her; instead, he promised her a duel at the academy.

'Right... he will be joining the academy as well now.'

She had thought that he would never join the hero academy.

It made her a little happy as well.

Among the four great clans, Azriel was the only one who was the same age as her, but unfortunately, he had never held any interest in being a hero like her.

Until now.

Curiosity enveloped her as she gazed at Azriel's face.

'What happened during those 2 years...?'

She wanted to know more about him.

It was then that it happened.

"...!"

Chills ran down her back.

His face...

It changed abruptly.

Before, he looked determined, with a fire in his crimson eyes directed at Caelus.

But now...

It was gone.

All of it was gone.

His expression, his eyes, and the air around him.

They all turned into a blank canvas.

'W-what...'

Celestina felt like she would be swallowed up staring into those deepening crimson eyes.

She couldn't see any emotion on his face or in his eyes.

Only detachment.

A detached gaze directed straight at the surprised Caleus.

It was as if he wasn't looking at Caleus as a human but as something insignificant.

Like he was gazing at the open air.

She would have suspected that it was a skill or something, but that couldn't be true.

'Unless he found something like that in the Void Realm, but...'

It seemed rare.

A skill that suppressed one's emotions was unheard of.

And if it existed, anyone would kill for it.

Not letting your emotions get the better of you in battle was something anyone would desire.

So...

'Did he learn to suppress his emotions in the Void Realm...?'

His words from earlier echoed in her mind.

'Just like the boy, I have survived a land of unimaginable horror… the Void Realm.'

Does surviving in the Void Realm result in such a change?

To become emotionless?

'No... even if he survived the Void Realm, that doesn't mean he was the only one to have ever done it.'

There were other humans who had done what Azriel had done.

But they never learned the ability to suppress their emotions.

'Just what happened there...'

The curiosity inside her heart, like a little flame, only burned even more.

Without allowing anyone to think further, Caleus was the first to move.

He thrust his spear forward faster than a dormant or awakened eye could follow, the long weapon piercing the air with a whistling sound.

Swish—!

Yet...

To his and everyone else's surprise, Azriel sidestepped, the spear's tip missing him by inches.

Azriel spun on his heel, bringing Void Eater down in a swift arc.

Clang—!

Void Eater clashed against the spear's shaft, the sound ringing through the ballroom like a ripple.

Sparks flew.

'No way...'

Celestina and the others were in disbelief.

Azriel had just dodged the attack of a grade 2 intermediate...

And countered.

Caleus wasn't just any grade 2 intermediate; he was the prince of the Nebula Clan, one who had more opportunities to train than most could dream of.

The children of the four great clans should be unrivaled in their ranks... except for Azriel Crimson.

Until now.

Azriel didn't allow him to breathe as he suddenly pressed the attack, his katana a blur of slashes.

Clang—!

Clang—!

Clang—!

The sound of their weapons clashing reverberated through the ballroom.

Caleus met him blow for blow, his spear twirling and parrying each of Azriel's attacks with calculated precision.

A quick lunge from Azriel forced Caleus back, making him grit his teeth.

He countered with a sweeping strike aimed at Azriel's legs.

"!!"

Yet to Caleus and everyone's surprise again, Azriel leaped, his body twisting unnaturally mid-air, Void Eater slashing downwards, forcing Caleus to roll to the side.

"Tch... were you out surviving in the Void Realm or secretly training under some master!?"

Caleus shouted, a little frustrated, yet everyone could clearly see the grin on his face.

Azriel didn't answer.

His eyes still looked at him with detachment.

They clashed again, Azriel's katana slicing in a horizontal sweep that Caleus blocked with his spear's shaft.

Clang—!

Azriel shifted his weight, pivoting to bring Void Eater down in a powerful overhead strike, but Caleus raised his spear just in time.

Clang—!

Celestina and the others were absorbed, watching the two try to gain the upper hand.

Caleus spun his spear in a wide arc to create distance, making Azriel leap back.

Clang—!

Clang—!

The duel took them across the ballroom, their movements a violent dance.

"Haaa!"

With a scream, Caleus retaliated with a series of rapid jabs, forcing Azriel to defend with Void Eater.

Clang—!

Clang—!

Clang—!

Azriel moved like lightning, parrying almost every thrust, but even he couldn't defend against them all.

His black tuxedo began to tear, and his cheek was grazed, causing him to leap back once again.

Drip... Drip...

The sound of his blood staining the floor resounded through the room.

"Azriel!?"

Jasmine shouted worriedly as she saw his wounds, yet...

Azriel didn't react.

Only a few managed to notice the slight twitch of his right eyebrow.

But that was it.

'Caleus is still stronger... he can't win in a contest of pure skill!'

Celestina had already concluded that it was going to be Azriel's loss.

The fact that he could fight Caleus evenly for this long was already tremendous.

But...

She clenched her fist until her knuckles turned white.

'...I want to see more.'

She didn't want it to end.

Celestina wanted to see more.

More of the one who was once called the unworthy prince.

*****

'Interesting.'

A singular thought ran through Azriel's mind as he gazed at Caleus.

Wiping the blood from his face, he looked at his red-stained fingertips.

Or at least, they should have been red since the world around him had turned colorless.

'I never thought I would get this far.'

Though [Void Mind] allowed his emotions to be suppressed and his thinking to be clearer, it didn't provide a physical boost.

But that didn't matter.

Winning was never his original plan.

At most, he wanted to draw against Caleus.

All he needed to do was put on a good performance for Freya.

At least that was what he was supposed to do, but now...

'It seems winning is a bigger possibility than I had thought.'

It was strange.

Azriel might have trained diligently, but not to the extent that he could keep up with Caleus.

It didn't take long for him to consider why he was managing to hold his own.

'The missing memories...'

It seemed that he had grown stronger than he realized, as his body was reacting instinctively against Caleus.

Azriel was sure of it since his footwork resembled a bit of Leo's as well.

There was a time when Leo had won the Muay Thai tournament in middle school.

But after winning, he had stopped practicing that sport, having grown tired of it.

'So I have managed to integrate a battle style consisting of Leo's and the old Azriel's.'

Truly interesting.

His plan had originally been to put on a good performance and, at best, draw against Caleus.

But now...

'Plans have changed.'

He was going for the win.

Chapter 36: Christmas Banquet [6]
"So, what do you think? Are you finally convinced?"

Freya didn't answer Solomon's question, her gaze fixed on the ongoing duel.

Clang—!

Clang—!

'He looks so different now...'

Solomon couldn't tell which Azriel was the real one.

Was it the one back in Europe?

The devil in the café?

The charming prince just before the duel?

Or the one before him now, who didn't even seem human?

Solomon had to hold back a chuckle.

'And they dare call me the clown.'

"His battle style is certainly strange... If he were on my level, even I would have been caught off guard multiple times."

Only praise left Solomon's lips as he observed Azriel dueling with Caleus.

The fight had grown more intense ever since Azriel started bleeding.

Everyone had already forgotten this was supposed to be a friendly spar.

"Muay Thai..."

"Huh?"

Solomon looked at Freya, surprised she had spoken.

"It's a forgotten martial art. Look at his stance, the way he shifts his weight. It's unmistakably Muay Thai, at least the basis of his style is."

Observing Azriel more closely, Solomon realized Freya was right.

As Azriel parried Caleus's spear thrust, he shifted his stance, delivering a swift knee strike to his ribs.

"Argh!"

The unexpected move threw Caleus off balance, and the crowd gasped. Azriel didn't relent; he followed up with his katana slicing through the air in a deadly arc.

His footwork was fluid.

Clang—!

Clang—!

Clang—!

Solomon narrowed his eyes, his face becoming serious. Anyone looking at him would be surprised to see such a rare expression.

"How did he learn something like that?"

It was ridiculous.

To integrate such an unconventional martial art with his swordsmanship—a monstrous feat.

'Ah... I was right to choose you, Azriel.'

No matter what happens, Solomon wouldn't regret his choices, even if it resulted in his downfall.

*****

'What the hell is wrong with this guy?!'

Every time Caleus lunged forward, his spear slicing through the air with deadly precision, the tip would graze past Azriel by mere inches.

It was as if the man was dancing around him, a ghostly wraith shifting just out of reach.

Azriel's movements were fluid and unpredictable, his body bending and twisting with a grace that made him seem almost untouchable.

Azriel would always shift his body or parry his attacks just in time.

His footwork constantly kept Caleus almost off guard.

His entire focus was on Azriel's body, moving like a snake trying to coil around him.

'Just how much did he train!?'

Even if Azriel spent two years in the void realm, the mere thought of him being able to be on par with Caleus on pure skill alone seemed absurd.

It made Caleus wonder if Azriel had perhaps been training in some secluded place instead of just surviving.

But nonetheless...

Caleus's grin never left his face.

It was fun.

The fact that Azriel wasn't weaker than him like Celestina or stronger like Jasmine or the Dusk Prince made him happy—and excited.

His predatory smile only widened as he looked into Azriel's deep crimson eyes.

To Caleus, it felt as though Azriel viewed him like some insignificant ant.

But...

'Are you enjoying yourself as well?'

To Caleus, it also seemed like Azriel was merely suppressing himself.

'Are you having fun like me?'

'Is your heart racing?'

'Can you feel the adrenaline coursing through you?'

The subtle twitch Azriel had when Caleus first grazed him was proof enough that he could feel pain.

He wasn't entirely emotionless, even if the sight of the blank-faced crimson prince made the hairs on Caleus's neck stand on end.

"Haa!"

Caleus lunged forward with a roar, aiming to sever Azriel's neck with a vicious swipe of his spear.

Azriel, anticipating the attack, dropped to one knee, the spear whistling overhead. In a single fluid motion, he whipped his katana upward in a deadly arc.

'Fast!'

Slish—!

Caleus's instincts kicked in just as the blade descended. He twisted to the left, feeling the air crackle with the force of the near miss. A thin line of blood traced his jawline as the blade grazed him.

Drip... Drip...

Instead of retreating, Caleus gritted his teeth and adapted on the fly. He switched his spear to his left hand with a practiced flick and thrust his open right palm toward the kneeling Azriel.

Azriel tilted his torso to the right, narrowly evading the strike.

'Gotcha!'

In that split second, as Azriel moved, Caleus's spear lunged toward his exposed neck.

But Azriel's reflexes were razor-sharp; he sprang backward with just enough speed to avoid a fatal wound, though the edge of the spear still drew a shallow cut across his neck.

'Tch...! always narrowly escaping.'

Azriel gaze remained as cold as ever. Blood seeped from the wound, but he didn't flinch, his expression betraying nothing of the pain this time.

Caleus narrowed his eyes, a complex mix of frustration and begrudging respect etching across his face.

'Always just out of reach...'

He could feel the duel dragging on longer than it should, his stamina waning with each passing moment.

The reliance on pure skill and the self-imposed restrictions made the fight feel like a relentless grind.

'...Once you're in the academy, I'll have a rematch with you, Azriel.'

A duel with no restrictions.

A fight where they could unleash their full power.

Caleus tightened his grip on his spear, muscles coiling as he bent forward, aiming the spearhead directly at Azriel's chest.

'If you win this exchange, then it will be my loss.'

Azriel, catching the shift in Caleus's stance, braced himself, gripping Void Eater with both hands.

He bent his knees and raised the blade in a defensive posture.

Neither had managed to land a decisive blow, but it wasn't due to lack of effort or hesitation—both were capable of getting healed almost instantaneously if deeply injured.

The reality was...

The Crimson and Nebula Princes were evenly matched in skill and resolve.

In a heartbeat, they sprang forward, their movements synchronized.

The ground trembled beneath them, sending ripples of wind that rustled the spectators' clothes and hair.

Caleus's spear thrust forward with deadly precision, targeting the narrow gap in Azriel's defense.

Simultaneously, Azriel's Void Eater arced through the air, a diagonal sweep intended to intercept.

Swish—!

Clang—!

The collision of their weapons rang out like a thunderclap, and they instantly vanished from sight.

A heartbeat later, they reappeared a meter apart, their backs turned to one another, panting heavily.

The crowd gasped, their breath collectively catching as they processed the scene.

Azriel's right shoulder bore a deep, gaping wound, blood seeping from the gash.

Caleus had a diagonal cut running from his left shoulder to his right waist, the blood already beginning to pool beneath him.

Their bodies swayed, struggling to maintain balance as they fought against the pull of their injuries.

Thud—!

Caleus was the first to fall to his knees, his spear clattering to the ground beside him.

Thud—!

Moments later, Azriel also crumpled to the ground, his blade slipping from his grasp.

A tense silence enveloped the arena as the crowd stared in stunned disbelief at the fallen princes.

The winner of the duel is...

Azriel Crimson.

Chapter 37: Engagement [1]
Both Azriel and Caleus sat on chairs, their wounds freshly treated by healers, the remnants of health potions still lingering on their tongues.

The duel had escalated far beyond what anyone anticipated, yet no one had the courage to intervene.

'To think I would actually manage to win...'

Azriel still felt like he was dreaming.

[Void Mind] had already deactivated, but he remembered every moment vividly, knowing he had been in control the entire time.

If he weren't at a banquet, under the scrutinizing gaze of every guest, he would have been jumping for joy at his victory.

But he couldn't afford to break his composure here.

The guests had lost interest in the two students now dueling in the middle of the ballroom, their battle paling in comparison to the clash between Azriel and Caleus.

These guests, hailing from high classes and corners of the world, had witnessed Azriel's remarkable return.

Rumors would soon spread like wildfire across Earth.

Conveniently, the banquet had a strict no-devices policy.

No footage existed of his performance today.

It was perfect—stories about Azriel would be twisted and turned, making it difficult for anyone to discern the truth from the embellishments.

"Seriously, what were you thinking..."

Azriel smiled awkwardly at Jasmine, who sat next to him with an exasperated look on her face.

Gulp-!

He swallowed hard, noticing the faint anger she was hiding behind her eyes.

"Well... I guess we did go a little overboard."

"Yes, a little. Definitely just a little."

Unfortunately, the more he spoke, the more anger Jasmine seemed to suppress.

She kept checking his already healed wounds as if they might reopen at any moment.

Health potions couldn't mend the tears in his black tuxedo, which Azriel found disappointing since it was probably extremely expensive.

Yet, most would view the scars on his tuxedo as badges of honor.

"Heh, you say 'fun,' but you fought like you were a ghost."

Turning to the person on his right, Azriel saw Caleus sipping red wine.

Next to Caleus was Celestina, who was eyeing him intently, whether she realized it or not.

Azriel shrugged.

"Maybe it didn't look like that to you, but I'm serious. I haven't felt my heart race like that in ages."

"Is that so..."

Caleus seemed satisfied with his response, grinning as he downed the rest of his wine.

'Where are Mom and Dad... and Uncle Ragnar?'

For some reason, they never returned to watch his duel. Perhaps it was for the best, knowing his mother.

'Dodged a bullet there, I guess.'

'...?'

Suddenly, he felt a piercing gaze from the other side of the ballroom, near the pianist. It was Solomon and Freya, both looking at him.

'I guess it's finally time, huh?'

Azriel stood up, drawing everyone's attention in the ballroom. Ignoring them, he was about to walk away when he felt a tug on his sleeve.

"Where are you going...?"

Looking down, he saw Jasmine still sitting, her brows furrowed with worry.

"Going to talk to Solomon and the headmistress for a bit."

"Oh..."

Jasmine nodded in understanding.

She wasn't aware of Azriel's connection with the headmistress, but she knew about Solomon saving him back in Europe.

Whenever Azriel attended a banquet or party, Solomon would also always talk with him.

"Just don't fight Saint Solomon..."

'Huh? Fight Solomon?'

Azriel looked confused but nodded and walked towards them.

Arriving at the table where Solomon and Freya were seated, Azriel took a seat, placing Freya on his right and Solomon on his left.

A pink, transparent dome-like barrier suddenly enveloped the table, drawing shocked stares from the onlookers.

"Sound barrier. No one will be able to read our lips," Freya explained, though Azriel already knew. He nodded anyway.

"I have to say, that was quite a fight you put up there! Didn't expect you to actually win," Solomon said, excitement evident in his voice.

"I got lucky."

Azriel shrugged.

"Anyway..."

Azriel turned his attention to Freya, who was looking back at him.

Her expression was so blank he almost suspected she might also have [Void Mind].

"Does this mean you're accepting my plan?"

For a few seconds, Freya didn't respond, her rose-colored eyes seeming to pierce into Azriel's soul.

Then...

"I am."

Azriel broke into a genuine smile for perhaps the first time today, oblivious to the effect it had on those sneaking glances at their table.

"I've already heard most of the details from Solomon, but what do you need me to do?" Freya asked.

"Not much, just two things actually."

'If she doesn't agree, it will become much harder to go through with the plan...'

Azriel suppressed a sigh at the thought.

"First, ensure that no matter what happens outside the void dungeon, the parties already inside aren't forced to cancel and return to the surface. I will personally handle any trouble inside the void dungeon."

The place they were headed after the entrance exam was called the void dungeon.

What better way to bond with classmates and grow stronger than to venture into one of the most dangerous places on Earth?

The void dungeon was one of the three great mysteries on Earth, appearing simultaneously with the first void rift.

To date, only 37 floors had been explored.

It was said that exploring all the floors and solving the other two great mysteries would reveal the origins of the void.

Of course, the students were only expected to explore the first five floors.

After that, they would typically be allowed to roam the city surrounding the void dungeon, which was also home to the Hero Academy.

Unfortunately, in the book Neo Genesis attacked, intending to eliminate the students in the void dungeon and those roaming the city.

Innocent people and students died as a result.

Fortunately, Solomon arrived before the worst could happen, preventing more deaths but canceling further dungeon exploration.

It was a tremendous shock for an organization hidden in the shadows for so long to openly attack one of the safest cities on Earth.

'Not this time, though...'

Azriel knew what was going to happen and planned to change the plot, ensuring Neo Genesis wouldn't get their way.

And how would he do that?

Simple.

Inform a trusted adult.

"Very well. I expected that."

Freya nodded, making Azriel feel relieved.

No one at this table would question how Azriel knew about the impending attack by Neo Genesis.

Each had their own reasons for supporting his plan.

Freya, for example, wanted to end the stagnant war between the void and humanity.

Allowing the students to continue exploring the dungeon and growing stronger was a step to achieve that.

"And the second?"

"My ranking after the entrance exam... I want it hidden until the end of the trip or, if possible, a lower ranking."

Freya narrowed her eyes in confusion as Solomon looked at him, both seemingly puzzled by his request.

"Why would you want to hide your ranking after everything you've done today?"

"!!"

It didn't take long for them to realize it.

"Confusion, huh... The rumors created today will seem false if you rank lower, making you a lower priority and underestimated. They'll focus more on the higher-ranking students without realizing a grade 3 intermediate is hiding among them until it's too late... ha!"

Solomon exclaimed, an amused smile on his face.

Azriel nodded.

While Solomon would deal with Neo Genesis on the surface, the lower-ranking members inside the void dungeon wouldn't expect a second grade 3 intermediate—Azriel Crimson.

Though it sucked to have his rank lowered, it was necessary to prevent a tragedy.

'It'll be interesting to see their shocked faces when I reveal myself...'

Perhaps it was a little fun to hide in the shadows once again.

Azriel looked towards Freya, waiting for her answer.

"...You will get whatever rank you earn in the entrance exam until the midterm exams."

Azriel smiled genuinely for the second time that day.

Chapter 38: Engagement [2]
"So, what do you think of him?"

Solomon asked, glancing at Freya.

Freya looked over at Azriel, who was now chatting with his sister, Caleus, and Celestina.

They had already finished discussing the plan for when Neo Genesis would attack.

The way Azriel was smiling while talking with his sister made Freya think of one thing since she met him.

"He stinks."

"Eh?"

Solomon looked baffled, surprised by Freya's crude remark about Azriel.

"Death... it's all around him."

To Freya, Azriel just reeked of death.

It made her skin crawl.

"He smells of death? Really? If I'm honest, he smelled normal—nice, even."

Freya turned her head towards Solomon.

"I can't explain why, but that's just how he smells to me... and it's not just that."

"Oohhh, there's more now, is there? You're surprisingly talkative today, Frey..."

Solomon said, intrigued and eager to hear more of Freya's opinion on Azriel.

Freya ignored his remarks and continued looking at Azriel.

"Ever since he stepped foot in this room..."

Freya narrowed her eyes at Azriel.

"Not a single truth has escaped his mouth."

She could feel it.

Those eyes of his...

They were full of lies.

Though he might have fooled everyone else with his act, he couldn't fool Freya.

'Still, it's impressive...'

When someone lies, there are usually signs in their body language or behavior. Yet Azriel exhibited none of these—no gaps, no tells.

But Freya knew he was lying.

If she was confident about one thing, it was recognizing the eyes of a liar.

Solomon, surprisingly, remained quiet, watching Freya intently.

"Same goes for you. Both of you are hiding things about the attack from me."

Once again, Solomon stayed silent, a calm smile on his face.

"That boy has his own agenda. He doesn't expect the plan he made to succeed, not in the slightest. In other words, he's using us—me."

Toying with Saints as if it were a game...

'He's quite bold, but...'

"That's not all you've figured out, is it?"

This time Solomon spoke up, his gaze conveying that he found the situation extremely amusing.

It wasn't.

Perhaps the most unsettling thing for Freya was...

"The way he looks at everyone here... It's as if he knows everything about them. Even me."

She stared at Solomon intensely, but he just chuckled and raised his hands defensively.

"Heh, relax. I promise I haven't told him a single thing about you."

She could tell he was not lying, but that only made Freya more unsettled.

If not Solomon, then who?

Or was it just a facade of confidence?

'He is dangerous.'

For a mere grade 3 intermediate, Azriel exuded a potential that, if fully realized, might become beyond her control.

"So, what are you going to do?" Solomon asked.
