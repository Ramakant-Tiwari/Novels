Celestina hesitated but eventually nodded, wishing him luck before turning to leave.

The instructors were busy with other cadets, while Jasmine seemed occupied as well.

The three instructors weren't following their own rules about staying out of the cadets' minds, which made Azriel chuckle.

He sighed, turning his gaze back to the cliff and gritting his teeth.

"Why does it have to be so high..."

Seriously.

Azriel was starting to wish he could punch whoever had designed this floor.

'It's going to take an hour or two to get down there... probably more.'

Without wasting any time, he glanced around to make sure no one was watching.

And then, he started to climb down the cliff—dangerously.

Chapter 83: Second Floor [4]

"Ah, shit! What the fuck was I thinking, proposing to do this willingly?"

The wind howled against Azriel's face as he clung to the jagged rock, his fingers desperately searching for cracks or edges to grip.

Each gust felt like a punch, the cold air gnawing at his exposed skin, and every step down felt like a reckless gamble with death.

On any other day, he might have laughed at himself, knowing that even with a blade pressed against his neck, he wouldn't have done what he was doing right now.

But...

Here he was.

Doing the one thing he swore he'd never do.

Heights were, without a doubt, his worst enemy.

One wrong move, one slip, and he'd plummet into the black sand below.

A quick, brutal end.

"How the fuck are the others supposed to climb down this cliff like me?"

Unlike Azriel, most cadets weren't this strong.

Though he prided himself more on his speed, he knew he was stronger than most first-years.

All except Lumine, perhaps.

He still wasn't sure if he could beat Lumine in a fight—not with all that Lumine was capable of.

"Unbalanced... yes, this entire floor is unbalanced!"

Azriel shifted his weight cautiously, feeling for stability with every foothold. The rocks were uneven, crumbling beneath his boots, sending loose gravel tumbling into the darkness. Each time it happened, his heart leaped in his chest, and his grip tightened instinctively.

The starry sky above him seemed like a swirling, oppressive void, pressing down on him, making the vast, open descent feel claustrophobic. It was as though the darkness itself was watching, waiting for him to make a mistake.

Gritting his teeth, Azriel pressed on, inching down the cliff without any protection—no one knew he was doing this, except maybe Celestina. Even she wouldn't have expected him to climb down like this.

Step by careful step, he descended.

At one point, the rock beneath his foot gave way, crumbling into loose gravel and sending his leg sliding out from under him.

His heart lurched as, for a terrifying moment, his fingers barely held onto the jagged edges of the cliff.

But he didn't fall.

Azriel kept going.

*****

"Hoo... hoo..."

Azriel exhaled heavily as he collapsed onto the black sand, finally reaching the bottom. Sweat dripped down his face, and he wiped it away with a trembling hand.

The heat was stifling—not just from the climb, but from the unnaturally warm black desert beneath him.

There was no sun in sight, yet it felt as though he was standing directly under its relentless glare.

The climb had taken more than four hours, leaving him with just 20 hours to return as he had promised Celestina.

The way he descended was reckless—too reckless. He doubted even Celestina had expected him to attempt something so dangerous, but he'd had no choice.

He couldn't afford to be seen.

And... he needed to be alone on this floor.

There was something he had to do here, and bringing others along would only complicate things.

A sense of dread crept into him as he thought about climbing back up later.

He shook his head.

'I'll leave that to the me twenty hours from now.'

Azriel glanced down at his hands.

They were bruised, scraped, and bloody.

With a quick tap on his storage ring, a health potion appeared in his palm. Just as he was about to drink it—

"I wouldn't recommend that. Sometimes it's better to let your body heal on its own for smaller wounds."

A voice cut through the silence.

Azriel jolted, dropping the potion into the black sand. In an instant, Void Eater was in his bloody hands, raised in front of him defensively.

His eyes narrowed as he searched for the source of the voice.

Then they widened in recognition.

Standing before him was a familiar figure, a small smile playing on his lips, hands casually behind his back.

"Instructor Kevin..."

'How did he get here...?'

Azriel was certain no one had seen him descend the cliff, and no one had followed.

So how had he appeared?

"Seriously? Climbing down that cliff without any equipment... Aren't you afraid of death?"

Instructor Kevin stepped closer, his tone almost teasing.

Azriel's eyes narrowed again, causing Kevin to raise his hands with a wry smile.

"Calm down, my prince. I'm here to make sure you don't die. Sure, we could've sent a drone, but we can't afford to take any risks when it comes to you—or any of the Great Children."

"...."

Seeing no deception in the instructor's words, Azriel lowered Void Eater, relaxing slightly, though he didn't dismiss the weapon entirely.

It seemed the instructors were more concerned about the consequences of anything happening to him, especially considering his connection to the Crimson Clan.

Even though cadets were told they could die on this trip, and no one would intervene if their actions led to death, that rule clearly didn't apply to Azriel or any of the Great Clans' children.

"You don't need to worry with me around," Kevin continued with a grin. "I'm a great travel companion. Besides, between me, Alicia, and Benson, I'm the strongest and the most fun."

Azriel stared at him blankly for a moment before letting out an exasperated sigh.

"Well, you're the instructor. It's not like I can go against you."

Kevin's smile brightened.

"I'm grateful for your cooperation, my prince."

Finding the heat unbearable, Azriel rolled up the sleeves of his academy uniform.

Though it was made from a material designed for flexibility and combat, it did little to shield him from the oppressive warmth of the black desert.

Instructor Kevin blinked, his eyes falling on Azriel's left arm, which was wrapped tightly in bandages, concealing any skin.

"You have another injury, my prince?"

Azriel followed his gaze and realized his mistake.

"Oh..." he muttered, realizing he'd forgotten to keep his mark hidden.

'What's done is done...'

Shrugging, he dismissed it casually.

"It's an injury I got during my time in the Void Realm. Unfortunately, no health potion can heal it."

Instructor Kevin's expression grew complicated, a flicker of sadness crossing his face.

"I see... I'm sorry to hear that. No child should have gone through what you did."

Azriel felt a certain amusement at his words. It wasn't as though Kevin truly knew what happened, and Azriel had never told anyone the story.

Waving his hand dismissively, he brushed off the concern.

"It's fine. I'm not the only one who's suffered. Everyone in this world has their burdens."

Kevin nodded in agreement, then smiled again.

"I suppose that's true, my prince."

Azriel didn't bother pulling his sleeve back down.

Nodding toward the distance, he spoke.

"I'll have to return to the top soon. After I get a general overview of the area up to that rock over there, we will head back."

He pointed at a large, jagged spike-like rock jutting out, standing oddly apart from the rest of the landscape.

Instructor Kevin nodded.

"Of course. I'll follow you, but don't worry—I won't interfere in any fights, my prince." There was a hint of excitement in his voice.

Azriel could understand why.

As the academy's first year apex student, he hadn't shown much of his true strength yet, only revealing his lightning and ice affinity and dispatching a few prowlers in the first floor.

With so many rumors circulating about him online, it was natural for people to have high expectations.

'No pressure at all...'

Without another word, Azriel began walking, with Instructor Kevin falling into step beside him.

The two moved in silence, the crunch of their boots the only sound in the otherwise quiet desert.

The heat still clung to Azriel, but he found it more bearable now, his body gradually adjusting to the oppressive warmth.

The heat radiated off the black sand in shimmering waves, distorting the horizon.

Despite Kevin's typically talkative nature, he remained respectfully silent, occasionally glancing at Azriel as if trying to gauge what was going through his mind.

Azriel appreciated the quiet.

His feet sank into the black sand with each step, the grains shifting beneath his weight. Scattered around him were bleached bones, some massive and ancient, others small and fragile, like remnants of creatures long forgotten.

Occasionally, he would step on one, hearing the brittle snap beneath his boots, though he paid little attention to it.

The vast expanse of black sand stretched endlessly around them, giving him a moment of strange peace, even if it was short-lived.

Chapter 84: Prelude to Genesis [1]

Men and women in pristine white lab coats moved methodically through the sterile, fluorescent-lit lab.

The room was filled with typical laboratory equipment: microscopes, vials of chemicals, and computers humming with data analysis.

The soft beeping of machines echoed faintly.

At one of the large windows, the view was nothing but an endless expanse of snow, a white desert stretching as far as the eye could see.

Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky, which, despite being a crisp blue, gave no warmth to the scene.

It was 4 a.m., but the brightness outside made it feel like the day had refused to end.

Among the scientists stood three men dressed in black military uniforms.

One of them, with jet-black hair and eyes to match, stood out as the target of muffled snickers.

The others—both soldiers and scientists—tried their best to suppress their laughter, their smiles betraying their efforts.

The man at the center of their amusement stood unmoved, staring back with a blank expression.

"G-Grand Executor Dante... y-you really need to stop spending all your time in the Azusa Mountains. Even for you, it's too dangerous alone."

One of the men stifled a laugh as he tried to speak, but none of them took Dante seriously.

Why would they?

The man hardly ever appeared, and when he did, he always rambled about waiting for "His Excellency's" orders in those forsaken mountains.

They couldn't understand him at all.

Even though he was stronger than all of them, Dante never acted against them.

Usually.

"Yes, Brian's right. That so-called god of yours is just—!"

The room fell silent, like a bucket of cold water had been thrown over them.

They all froze, biting their tongues.

Dante's eyes had narrowed, and the weight in the air shifted, growing heavy and oppressive.

Their smiles faded.

"I've warned you not to speak of His Excellency, haven't I, Bran?"

Dante's voice was cold, sharp.

"One more word about His Excellency, and I'll rip out the tongues of every man here and present them as an offering."

The men swallowed hard, nodding furiously, all except for Void Commander Brian and Bran—the twins, identical with brown hair and hazel eyes, standing apart from the rest.

"Sir Dante," Brian said, his voice strained.

"How long is this going to go on? What you're doing is treason. You serve that 'Excellency' of yours instead of His Great Supreme Archon. You destroyed every military base in France and slaughtered soldiers without authorization. Whose side are you really on?"

It felt as if a blade hovered over Brian's throat when Dante turned his gaze toward him, a sudden smirk curling at his lips.

The twins exchanged confused glances while the others looked increasingly uneasy.

"You're mistaken, Brian," Dante said slowly.

"Neo Genesis has always served His Excellency. My trip to France... was not in vain."

Their confusion deepened, but Dante continued.

"Prince Azriel Crimson was there."

"...!"

Shock rippled through the room.

All eyes locked onto Dante.

"What? The Prince of the Crimson Clan was in France? Why?"

"He had just returned from the Void Realm," Dante replied. "I believe His Excellency sent me to retrieve the Prince, but by the time I arrived, he was already gone. I only discovered it was him after interrogating soldiers at one of the bases."

"What does that prince have to do with any of this?" Bran snapped.

"We want him dead, remember? He's a threat to the future, and we need to get rid of him."

Dante's smirk widened—an unsettling expression none of them had ever seen on his face.

A chill ran through the room as they watched him tap on his storage ring.

A small object appeared in his hand.

"What is that…?"

"A recording device."

Dante pressed the button.

"Not much, just two things actually."

The sudden voice of a man cut through the room. Everyone fell silent, listening intently.

"First, make sure that no matter what happens outside the void dungeon, those already inside aren't forced to cancel and return to the surface. I'll personally handle any problems within."

Their expressions hardened as the words sank in.

"Very well. I expected as much."

"!!"

Their eyes widened at the sound of the female voice in the recording.

"That voice…"

"It can't be…!"

"And the second?"

"My ranking after the entrance exam... I want it hidden until the end of the trip or, if possible, lowered."

"...."

"Confusion, huh... The rumors created today will seem false if you rank lower, making you a lower priority and underestimated. They'll focus more on the higher-ranking students without realizing a grade 3 intermediate is hiding among them until it's too late... ha!"

Dante tapped the button, ending the recording.

Silence swallowed the room, broken only by the steady beeping of computers.

Three voices had echoed through the device—two male, one female. Everyone recognized two of them.

"Saint Solomon and Headmistress Freya… but the other voice…"

"...."

"Prince Azriel Crimson…"

Dante tucked the recording device back into his storage ring, his gaze sweeping over the room with satisfaction.

"This… this doesn't make sense. What are you saying, Dante?!"

Bran's confusion turned to anger as he glared.

Dante's smile grew disturbingly wide, twisting into something dark.

Their bodies tensed, cold fear crawling up their spines.

His expression was horrifying.

"The attack on the void dungeon was leaked."

"What?!"

"You... you betrayed us?!"

Dante shook his head slowly, the eerie smile still plastered on his face.

A soft, unsettling laugh escaped his lips.

"Of course not. His Excellency simply sees more clearly than the rest of us… Azriel Crimson works for His Excellency... and us."

The twins blinked in disbelief, their confusion deepening.

"What did you just say...?"

Dante spread his arms wide, his voice almost reverent.

"Ah, isn't it beautiful? His Excellency has fooled everyone so easily! Twisting their minds, playing with their perceptions until it's too late. It's magnificent, isn't it!?"

The scientists and the twins stared at him in growing horror.

Tears streamed down Dante's face as he looked up, arms outstretched, lost in a rapturous trance.

"To be part of such grandeur! My life has never felt so complete! And once His Excellency rewards me… ah, I can't wait!"

Brian clutched his head, staggering over to a chair, massaging his forehead in disbelief.

"This… this is too much."

Bran, on the other hand, stormed toward Dante, his face twisted with rage. He grabbed Dante by the shoulders, pulling him close, their faces inches apart.

"Grand Executor Dante, have you lost your damn mind?! What's in that recording doesn't match reality at all! Azriel Crimson isn't hiding his rank—he's the fucking apex!"

"And even if, by some miracle, he is on our side, we need to cancel the plan."

If Azriel Crimson was their enemy, he had to be eliminated.

But…

If he was truly an ally…

The possibility of having a prince on their side could change everything.

Yet Dante only smiled, unbothered by the gravity of the situation.

"Exactly... He fooled me. Us. Them. No one is worthy of knowing His Excellency's true plan... except for the prince."

"You're insane… you've lost your mind."

Brian stumbled back, releasing his grip on Dante. His face twisted in revulsion as he staggered away.

The man had completely lost it. There was no reasoning with him anymore.

"What is going on here?"

""...!""

Thud–!

It all happened in an instant.

The moment that voice spoke from behind Brian, every person in the room collapsed to their knees, heads bowed low.

Even Dante.

The air grew suffocating, crushing their lungs under its weight.

Hearts pounded in terror, each beat like a drum against their ribs, growing louder and more erratic.

Fear.

Pure, unrelenting fear.

That's all they felt.

Dante's lips trembled, his eyes glued to the floor.

His voice was barely a whisper, breath caught in his throat.

"H-Hep... Hepta... rch…"

The blood drained from their faces as they felt a presence—its gaze boring into them, freezing them in place.

"…Heptarch Zoran."

"I return after a year in the Void Realm, cleaning up the Fallen Sky, and the first thing I see is a bunch of clowns fighting each other. Was it a mistake to anchor myself here?"

"N-no… m-my lord, please forgive us. It's just… a situation has occurred."

Brian's voice shook, his entire body trembling. He didn't dare look up.

None of them did.

The scientists lay sprawled across the ground… unconscious.

"Oh? And what situation would that be?"

"T-the plan to attack the Void Dungeon… it was l-leaked. I-I'm sorry. We know how difficult it was to operate in Asia with the F-four Great Kings there. Please, allow us to fix this!"

Bran slammed his forehead into the ground, Brian quickly following suit.

But Dante didn't move.

"…How was the plan leaked?"

Zoran's voice dropped, darker, more dangerous.

The trembling worsened.

The three of them shook so violently that sweat poured from their skin, dripping onto the floor.

"P-p-prince Azriel... leaked it to S-saint Solomon and Headmistress F-freya..."

Bran stammered, barely able to speak.

The moment the words left his mouth, the room fell into an eerie silence.

Even the gentle beeping of the computers had stopped.

Their hearts clenched painfully.

A single thought gripped their minds:

'Am I already dead?'

They didn't move. No one dared.

The silence stretched endlessly, time slowing to a crawl.

It felt like an eternity before they were finally released from the invisible noose tightening around their necks.

"...Who?"

Chapter 85: Prelude to Genesis [2]

Even though they were indoors, it felt like they were standing naked in an open, frozen wasteland.

"Who did you say leaked our plan...?"

Zoran's low, chilling voice slithered into their ears.

"A-Azriel Crimson… son of Joaquin Crimson, the Crimson King of East Asia. He was supposed to have been killed two years ago."

Bran's words were swallowed by yet another suffocating silence.

"...."

They wanted to breathe, but each attempt felt like drowning. Every gasp of air stuck in their throats, unable to escape.

"Are you telling me that a dead child leaked our plan? A plan that was nearly impossible to execute because we've barely any foothold in Asia? And now it's ruined... because of a kid who's supposed to be dead?"

Bran and Brian bit down hard on their lips, tasting blood.

"T-that's not true, Lord Zoran…"

Dante's voice broke through the tension, though it trembled like a thread about to snap.

"Oh? Then let's hear it. Look into my eyes, Dante."

Dante hesitated, but slowly, obediently, he lifted his head.

The sight that met him made his skin crawl, as if thousands of ants were swarming beneath his flesh.

'It's just like His Excellency…'

Zoran's figure was barely human—a shadow made flesh, like a twisted, living darkness.

But there was a difference.

A glaring, terrifying difference between Zoran and Nol from White Haven.

Zoran's head was crowned by glowing, white orbs where his eyes should have been—soulless lights that bore into Dante's very being, making his mind scream at him to run.

'Why... why is there such a gap between us…?'

Dante was a Grand Executor, while Zoran was a Heptarch. A difference of only one rank. Yet standing in Zoran's presence, it felt like the chasm between a human and a god.

No…

There was never any gap to begin with.

No matter how high Dante climbed, the distance between him and a Heptarch remained the same—unbridgeable, infinite.

No one had ever witnessed someone rise to the rank of Heptarch.

No.

They were always just… there.

Like His Supreme Archon.

Dante's mouth barely opened as he began to recount everything he'd told Bran and Brian.

His throat burned, but he pushed through, knowing that every word could be his last.

Zoran's glowing eyes didn't blink.

He didn't move.

He only stared down at Dante, silently absorbing every word until Dante finished his report.

'I need water… I can't breathe…'

Dante's throat felt like it was on fire, every swallow of air agonizing. He wanted to run, to throw himself out of Zoran's sight.

He was terrified.

He knew that if Zoran willed it, he could die in an instant.

Dante bit his lip, forcing his gaze to meet those hollow, glowing eyes once more. He didn't know what Zoran truly looked like beneath the shadows.

Perhaps it was better that way.

Because deep down, Dante knew: no matter how much stronger he became, he would never want to deal with someone like Zoran.

'Why… why isn't he saying anything?!'

It was hell.

The silence was hell.

Time felt warped, stretched beyond reason.

Dante's eyes were locked with Zoran's soulless orbs, and though only seconds had passed, it felt like an eternity.

His mind screamed at him to look away, but his body wouldn't obey.

His heart pounded in his chest, each beat a drum that seemed to grow louder in his ears.

Until—

"…That's not possible."

Zoran's voice sliced through the suffocating quiet like a blade, and it sent a violent shiver down Dante's spine.

But his voice—there was a tremor.

Dante's skin crawled.

His eyes darted toward Zoran's mouth, trying to find movement, something to latch onto, but there was nothing.

No lips to form words, no expression to read—only the dark, shapeless figure of a man and those terrifying orbs, glowing brighter now.

"No… no, no, no, no!"

The room quaked.

A deep, visceral vibration that seemed to come from the walls themselves, as if the very foundation of the building had reacted to Zoran's words

"Impossible!"

Glass vials shattered, spraying the floor with fragments.

Dante felt his blood turn to ice.

His mind couldn't grasp the madness unfolding before him.

Zoran's voice had grown louder, deeper, filled with a rage that made Dante's stomach twist into knots.

It felt like the very air in the room was being sucked away, leaving only the stifling weight of dread.

The pressure in his chest built, a suffocating force that made it impossible to draw a full breath.

"Azriel Crimson… the Apex!? White Haven!? Our plan… leaked!?"

Zoran's voice cracked like thunder, making their bodies tremble violently.

The dark, shadowy hands that were Zoran's fingers clutched at his head, his voice spiraling into a frenzy.

"This wasn't supposed to happen! It wasn't supposed to be! Not like this!"

He staggered, lurching towards a table, his fingers scraping across the metal surface with a sound that sent shivers down their spines.

A horrible screech, like nails on a chalkboard, echoed in the lab.

"The book… yes, the book… it'll tell me the truth. It always tells me the truth. It never lies. Never."

Dante's heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst from his chest.

He wanted to run.

Every fiber of his being screamed at him to flee, to get out of the room, but his feet remained rooted to the spot.

He looked toward Bran and Brian, but they were just as paralyzed with fear, their eyes wide, faces pale, bodies trembling.

Dante and the twins squinted as a sudden, eerie white glow flickered on the table.

When it subsided, a thick book lay there—its cover completely white.

Its cover was a stark, unsettling white, and though Dante couldn't explain why, the sight of it sent a wave of nausea crashing over him.

Zoran's trembling hand reached out, grabbing it.

He opened the book with a snap.

Dante watched, breath shallow, as Zoran scanned the first page.

He turned to the second, then the third, his movements growing faster.

Fourth.

Fifth.

Sixth.

Page after page, Zoran flipped, his eyes darting frantically over the words.

And then—

"No… no, no, no… this is a joke. A cruel joke the gods are playing with me!"

Zoran's voice was manic as he tore at the pages, ripping them out one by one.

"They're blank! Why are they all blank!?"

Dante and the twins were frozen, watching in horror as Zoran spiraled further into madness.

The longer he flipped through the book, the more feral his movements became.

"It's all gone… ruined! Destroyed! You damned fool… what have you done?!"

Zoran's voice was almost unrecognizable now, filled with a despair that seemed to echo off the walls.

The windows shattered, the cold wind howling into the room, biting at their skin like razors.

None of them moved, none of them breathed.

They could only watch as Zoran's madness unfolded before them

"The future… it's all destroyed!"

Dante felt something wet trickle down his face.

His trembling hand reached up, touching his cheek.

Tears.

He was crying.

But why?

He didn't understand.

He didn't even feel sad.

Just… lost.

Then, Zoran's eyes locked onto Dante.

A violent shudder ran down Dante's spine.

Zoran took a step toward him.

'Run...'

The thought screamed in Dante's mind.

Run.

Another step.

And another.

Zoran was standing over him now, his towering form casting a long, dark shadow over Dante's trembling body.

Dante had to crane his neck to look up, but he wished he hadn't.

Those glowing eyes, once terrifying, now seemed to bore into his soul.

But he couldn't move.

His legs were paralyzed, as if weighed down by invisible chains.

"You… what does Azriel Crimson look like?"

Dante tried to swallow, but his throat was bone-dry.

His voice barely worked.

"B-black hair… and red eyes… like his sister, Jasmine Crimson. He has a black katana that belonged to king Joaquin…"

Zoran's shadowy hand shot forward, brushing against Dante's cheek.

The cold touch made him flinch.

The twins looked on, horrified, but just as frozen as Dante.

Zoran's hand gently traced Dante's face, his fingers lingering in an almost tender gesture.

"I suppose I'll have to deal with that dead child myself…"

"L-lord Zoran, if you could just listen— the prince is work—"

"Shush… now. It's alright. Everything will be alright."

Dante fell silent.

Zoran's cold fingers wiped the tears from his eyes, the touch strangely comforting.

Another hand rested firmly on Dante's shoulder, while the one on his face slid to the back of his head.

More tears streamed down Dante's cheeks, and to his own shock, he found himself smiling.

He didn't understand.

"It's just as you said earlier… that Excellency of yours and Azriel Crimson fooled you. Fooled us. Fooled them."

Zoran's white, glowing eyes seemed softer now.

Dante stared into them, captivated.

'Beautiful…'

They weren't terrifying anymore.

No.

They were beautiful.

Then—

The only sounds that followed were of something tearing, and the unnatural, gut-wrenching screams that echoed out of the lab.

Sounds that no human voice could make.

Chapter 86: Descent into Madness [1]

"...Are you still angry at me?"

After a few seconds, Jasmine shook her head, sighing tiredly.

"I'm not... It was normal for Azriel to go, but I can't help worrying about him."

Especially with the Void Dungeon targeting him.

If it weren't for Instructor Kevin being there to protect him, she would have already chased after him.

But she held back.

She couldn't be someone who shielded Azriel from every danger... not now, at least.

"Still, he's probably even more mad at me after you told him about the tunnel that led to the bottom of the cliff..."

Jasmine gave a wry smile, but Celestina blinked at her in confusion.

"I haven't told him anything, though."

"What...?"

Jasmine stared at Celestina as if she were messing with her.

"You... you didn't tell him about the tunnels? You're joking, right? Right?"

Celestina began to look uneasy.

"Huh, b-but shouldn't he already know about the tunnels...? It's one of the few things we are allowed to know about the second floor."

"As if that idiot ever bothered to learn about the Void Dungeon...!"

Jasmine went pale, and the blood drained from Celestina's face too.

They locked eyes in panic, and then—

They dashed toward the edge of the cliff.

Both squinted, scanning below for any sign of him.

"I-I don't see him."

Celestina exhaled in relief, but her blood ran cold again.

"Wait... if we don't see him, d-don't tell me he climbed all the way down?"

A shiver ran down both their spines.

"What have I done... I was only teasing him, but now I made him climb all the way down... What a terrible sister I am."

Jasmine felt tears welling up in her eyes.

To think Azriel had actually descended the cliff, all because she'd messed with his fears.

She felt like a failure of an elder sister.

"No, but... wouldn't he have the common sense to know this is too much? It's not like he did stuff like that in the Void Realm... right?"

Celestina was in denial, both of them wallowing in guilt over letting Azriel climb down the cliff.

Yet, relief washed over them when they saw no body.

"Huh, what's up with you two?"

Their heads snapped toward the familiar voice.

Lumine approached, glancing down the cliff next to them.

Both bit their lips—they didn't want to admit what they'd made Azriel do.

"Man, it's going to be tough for all of us to climb down this thing..."

""Eh...?""

They looked stunned at Lumine's mutter.

"I wonder how long it took Azriel to get down. Maybe we should race him when he comes back."

Those dreadful words made Celestina and Jasmine cautiously step back from Lumine.

Lumine noticed their retreat, confused.

"Seriously, are you two alright? You're acting strange."

"Haha, yes, yes, we're strange. Please ignore us, Cadet Lumine."

Jasmine laughed wryly, and the two of them continued backing away, eyeing Lumine warily.

Lumine's frown deepened.

The way they looked at him was as if he were some kind of madman.

Before he could question them further—

"Kanae!"

"What's wrong with you!?"

"Shit! Look at her eyes!"

Lumine's words were abruptly cut off by the shouts of the cadets.

Instantly, their heads snapped toward the source of the commotion.

The cadets had gathered in a tight circle, their expressions stricken with fear.

Something was very wrong.

Without hesitation, Jasmine, Celestina, and Lumine pushed through the crowd.

There, standing alone, was a female cadet.

It was Cadet Kanae.

She was motionless, frozen in place.

Jasmine and Celestina frowned, recognizing her immediately.

"Cadet Kanae?" Jasmine called out, stepping closer.

"Is something wrong?"

No response.

Jasmine's brow furrowed, her confusion deepening as Kanae continued to stand there, utterly unresponsive, like a marionette whose strings had been cut.

Something was terribly off.

The air around Kanae felt... wrong.

"Kanae?"

Jasmine tried again, louder this time.

Still no response.

Before Jasmine could take another step, her body froze.

Just like Lumine. Just like Celestina.

Kanae's eyes...

They were completely white, devoid of color or life, like the eyes of a corpse left too long in the cold.

She stood there, eerily still, her gaze fixed on something far beyond them.

"Kanae, snap out of it!" one of her friends shouted, rushing forward to grab her by the shoulders, shaking her violently.

Still, Kanae did not move.

"We need help immediately!" another cadet yelled, voice trembling, their panic spreading like wildfire through the group.

'What is this...?'

She had never seen anything like it.

Footsteps echoed from behind.

Instructor Alicia and Instructor Benson were approaching, drawn by the growing commotion.

"Step back, all of you!" Jasmine ordered.

"...."

The moment Jasmine took a step closer, those white eyes of Kanae shifted.

"...!"

They locked onto her.

Jasmine's breath caught in her throat.

She couldn't move.

The night sky seemed to collapse around her, her vision narrowing until all she could see were those eyes—those soulless, cold eyes, staring straight into her.

Her body refused to move.

The cold seeped deeper, tightening around her chest like a vice.

She felt as if her very soul was being stripped bare, as if Kanae was staring through her, unraveling her from the inside out.

Chills raced down her spine.

For what felt like an eternity, Kanae stood there, her gaze boring into Jasmine's very core.

And then—

Kanae smiled.

*****

Azriel meticulously explored the landscape around him, planning to map it later.

Instructor Kevin trailed behind, his steps echoing with an unsettling rhythm as they progressed deeper.

The black sand crunched beneath their feet, occasionally disturbed by the bleached bones of unknown creatures.

"My prince, you seriously need to socialize more. With how few friends you have, you come off as a bit of a loner," Kevin remarked, his voice laced with a hint of exasperation.

"I do have friends," Azriel replied without glancing at him, their conversation continuing as they walked.

Azriel had grown accustomed to Kevin's incessant chatter, a sign that Kevin was evidently bored and seeking engagement.

"Seriously? Name them."

Azriel furrowed his brow at the question.

'Who...?'

After a pause, he finally spoke.

"Friends like Lumine, Celestina, and Yelena."

Kevin's skeptical gaze met Azriel's.

"Are you really friends with them, though? From what I see, you only act like acquaintances. You seem closest to Princess Celestina though."

Azriel nodded slightly.

"So... are the two of you together or something?"

A twitch of discomfort crossed Azriel's lips as he met Kevin's eager, sparkling eyes.

'Why is he acting like a teenage girl?'

He sighed.

"We're not together. It's more of a work in progress."

Kevin's curiosity seemed to peak.

"Don't tell me... my prince is in love?"

Azriel's forehead creased in annoyance.

"I am not."

"Huh? Then what do you mean by 'work in progress'? If you're toying with a girl's heart, I advise against it."

Azriel considered Kevin's implication.

'What's he imagining? Actually, he's not entirely wrong.'

"What's so wrong about that? I make her fall for me, and maybe I'll fall for her too."

A heavy silence settled between them.

The wind whispered through the desolate landscape.

"...My prince, I must strongly advise against whatever you're doing," Kevin said finally, his tone darkening.

Azriel looked at Kevin, confusion etching his face. Kevin's head was bowed, a grim expression shadowing his features.

"What you're trying to do is pursue love, but your approach is flawed. Love can't be forced. It requires patience and time."

Azriel opened his mouth to argue, but no words came out. They lodged in his throat, stifled.

'Why...?'

He knew Kevin was right, but why did it matter, especially coming from someone so distant?

A heavy silence settled between them, neither speaking as they continued walking.

Then...

"..."

"..."

"...My prince."

"Yeah?"

"Didn't we... already pass this point?"

Both halted, staring at the familiar terrain they had crossed twenty minutes earlier.

'What is happening...?'

A creeping unease enveloped Azriel. Something was terribly wrong.

He licked his lips, only to find them parched. Swallowing, he realized his throat was dry—there was no moisture at all.

'Water... I need water.'

"!!"

A sudden, intense thirst clawed at him.

Azriel's head snapped to the right as he saw Instructor Kevin collapse to his knees, clutching his throat.

"Krhk...! My throat is burning!"

The heat was becoming unbearable.

Azriel could only watch as Kevin writhed on the black sand, his struggle both haunting and pitiful.

A hollow laugh escaped Azriel's lips.

"Ah, this..."

Azriel's throat tightened painfully, his strength waning with each agonizing moment.

Desperately, he fumbled with his storage ring, releasing several bottles of water he had stashed away.

With trembling hands, he threw one to Kevin, who writhed on the ground as though he were on the brink of death.

Azriel couldn't blame him.

Just as they were about to drink from the bottles, an icy wind brushed against their cheeks, freezing them in place.

'What...'

Both Azriel and Kevin felt a shiver of terror as they turned to see a figure standing before them.

Chapter 87: Descent into Madness [2]

Azriel felt his insides burn as if a fire raged within him, yet at the same time, an icy wind brushed against his skin, making him shiver uncontrollably.

The conflicting sensations gnawed at him—heat scorching him from the inside, cold prickling him from the outside.

It was disorienting.

He collapsed to his knees next to Instructor Kevin, every movement scraping against him like sandpaper.

The bottle of water sat useless in their hands, untouched.

In front of Azriel, a figure materialized.

Blurred, shadowy, its features unrecognizable.

Yet its presence alone was enough to freeze him in place.

"Ooooo... hmmmm... laaaah... mmmm..."

A soft lullaby drifted from the figure, eerie and gentle.

The melody wrapped around him like a noose.

Azriel's eyes, wide and unblinking, locked onto the figure.

He couldn't look away. He didn't want to look away.

"Ooooo... hmmmm... laaaah... mmmm..."

The lullaby persisted, and with every note, a strange comfort washed over him.

The pain, the thirst—everything faded.

Why did this feel so familiar?

It was wrong.

He knew that.

Yet, the more he listened, the calmer he felt, as though he was sinking into some dark, warm abyss.

His body, previously crippled with pain, moved on its own.

He stood, the bottle of water slipping from his hand and landing in the sand with a muted thud.

Each movement should've hurt, but Azriel didn't notice.

He was entranced.

Step by step, he moved toward the figure.

"Mmmm... ohhhh... laaaah... hmmmmm..."

He couldn't even tell if the voice belonged to a man or a woman.

"My prince... wait..."

Kevin's voice was faint, hoarse—distant.

It didn't matter.

Nothing mattered but that song.

Azriel continued walking.

The pain that had once ravaged his body dulled into nothingness, replaced by a peaceful numbness.

A sense of serenity.

He walked.

And walked.

Until he was close enough to see it.

Azriel's steps faltered as the figure's features slowly sharpened.

The lullaby still dripped from its lips, but now he could see clearly.

It was a woman.

Her hair, a soft chocolate brown, cascaded down her shoulders.

Her eyes, aa shade of emerald green, gleamed.

Her skin was pale—too pale, like freshly fallen snow untouched by the sun that did not exist here.

She wore a simple white dress, flowing around her.

In her arms, she cradled a torn, black cloth, stroking it gently.

She looked down at it with a soft, affectionate smile as she continued to hum the lullaby, her voice soothing.

"Mmmm... ohhhh... laaaah..."

"Ah..."

A breath escaped Azriel's lips, barely audible.

His body trembled, lips quivering as the realization struck him.

He knew this woman.

"Mother..."

The moment the word escaped his lips, Azriel felt his blood freeze.

His eyes widened as he suddenly snapped out of the trance.

The lullaby didn't cease.

The woman remained oblivious, still cradling whatever lay beneath the torn cloth.

This was wrong. Everything was wrong.

'Why... why is she here...?'

A mental attack.

It had to be.

Just like that time in Europe.

He had nearly succumbed to the crying fog then; he wasn't about to make the same mistake again.

Or... at least, that's what he wanted to believe.

Yet, he couldn't move a single muscle, his gaze locked onto the woman before him.

She looked so real.

The more he stared, the weaker he felt, memories flooding back unbidden.

Their last conversation.

The accident.

The hospital.

The hateful eyes she had given him in her final moments.

Azriel's hands curled into fists, his nails digging into his palms until blood dripped.

'Why the fuck is it always a mental attack...?'

The sheer fact that a creature could invade his mind—and was strong enough to manifest here, on the second floor—darkened his thoughts.

'Of course, something like this would happen...'

If the first floor hadn't finished him off, then the second surely would.

And if that didn't do the job...

"My prince... please, don't move."

Kevin's hoarse voice reached him as he stood beside him, offering the bottle of water Azriel had dropped.

"Don't get too close. Don't look away from it... and don't talk to it."

Azriel nodded heavily, eyes still fixated on the figure that resembled his mother.

He gulped down the water in one go, his focus unbroken.

"What you're seeing is what we call a Cradler—nasty void creatures that manipulate your mind by taking the form of someone you wish to see. It's not someone I know, so it must be someone you desire. Here, I thought it would be someone more familiar…"

"Get to the point, Instructor."

Kevin's expression darkened.

"Right... The thing is, Cradlers are supposed to only appear from the seventh floor onward..."

'Great...'

A void creature that belonged on the seventh floor had manifested on the second.

Azriel kept staring, unwilling to look away.

Squinting slightly, he tried to sense its mana core, but found nothing.

"Instructor, where is its mana core?"

"We're not seeing its real body... I think."

His words provided little comfort as a sigh escaped Azriel's lips.

"So how do we kill it?"

A surprised expression crossed Kevin's face, but he didn't break his gaze from the Cradler.

"My prince, we can't. We need to retreat and head back to the surface. I thought we'd be fine, even with a small floor shift or two, but... a Cradler on the second floor? Gods know what else might be lurking."

Azriel bit his lip.

Kevin was right; it was becoming too risky.

Only Jasmine knew about the void dungeon targeting him, and even he found it ridiculous to confront a Cradler on this floor in person.

The Cradler showed no signs of changing its actions, still singing that lullaby, still cradling whatever lay beneath the cloth.

That smile...

It made Azriel sick.

His face contorted in disgust.

"Instructor, what's beneath that cloth?"

His voice came out colder than intended, surprising Kevin.

"I don't know. All Cradlers have them; they specialize in mental attacks. Their singing lures victims and leads to their demise, but I can't say what's hidden beneath that cloth."

Silence fell as Azriel continued to stare at it.

"My prince... if it's not too rude, who is this woman before us?"

Kevin's curiosity was understandable, though there was a time and place for such questions.

Azriel hesitated, listening to the lullaby echo in his mind.

"... A dead woman."

"I see... I apologize for asking something so insensitive."

Azriel nodded, his gaze fixed.

"It's fine, but how do we get out of this situation?"

Kevin tilted his head, considering the woman.

"We walk back slowly and hope it leaves us alone?"

"...."

'What did he just say...?'

Azriel felt a chill of disbelief, though he couldn't bring himself to look at Instructor Kevin.

He simply nodded and followed the instructions.

Slowly, he took a step back.

Then another.

And another.

Instructor Kevin mirrored his movements.

But...

It didn't take more than five steps before an icy shiver ran through Azriel.

The singing had stopped.

"Instructor...!"

"Calm down! Just don't move!"

Azriel obeyed, frozen in place.

Neither of them dared to budge as they watched the Cradler, who continued to stare at the cloth, its smile unmoving but its song ceased.

Azriel's heart pounded against his ribs.

He was desperate to destroy the void creature in front of him, yet he knew he was powerless.

A Cradler was a formidable foe—even Instructor Kevin had to be on high alert.

Then...

With the same smile, the woman who resembled his deceased mother finally looked up.

A shuddering breath escaped Azriel's lips as those familiar, eyes locked onto his.

He felt as though he was suffocating.

"Instructor..."

"Don't move, my prince... not yet."

They continued to stare at one another, cold sweat dripping from both Azriel and Kevin.

The tension was suffocating.

Until...

"It has been so long, hasn't it, dear?"

"…!"

Azriel's eyes widened, his breath catching in his throat.

The voice, unmistakably his deceased mother's, made his blood run cold once again.

He gritted his teeth, remembering Kevin's warning:

Don't get too close. Don't look away from it and don't talk to it.

Azriel wanted to rip the Cradler's tongue out, his rage boiling over.

The Cradler tilted its head, a look of confusion on its face as it tapped its chin thoughtfully.

"Is something wrong, my dear? It's been so long. I long to hear your voice."

"Don't say a word. It wants you to fall for its tricks," Kevin murmured urgently.

Azriel nodded.

He wanted this to end swiftly.

Seeing his deceased mother's acting like this was agonizing.

He had to bite his tongue, struggling to keep the urge to vomit at bay.

"Oh, I see…"

A look of sudden realization spread across the Cradler's face, her smile widening unnervingly.

""!!""

She took a deliberate step forward.

And then...

She was right in front of Azriel.

Inches away from his face.

Azriel's mind went blank.

He could barely react as a cold shiver ran down his spine from the sudden, chilling touch on his cheek.

"It must have been lonely, right? You don't need to hold back in front of me anymore, my sweet, sweet dear…"

Chapter 88: Descent into Madness [3]

"Leo…! What are you doing!?"

Jeanne's voice broke the stillness as she slid open the glass door, stepping barefoot onto the lawn.

Leo turned, his eyes blinking at the sight of his mother hurrying toward him.

His expression lit up.

"Mother!"

His smile was bright, almost too bright for the grotesque contrast it held against the scene before her.

Jeanne's breath hitched.

She froze, her hand trembling as it hovered over her mouth.

"Leo... w-what... is the meaning of this?"

"...?"

In his right hand, he held a kitchen knife, its edge smeared with blood.

In his left, a crow lay limp, its wings twitching helplessly, feathers slicked with blood.

Its feet… they were gone.

Jeanne's stomach twisted violently as her eyes darted to the tiny feet discarded on the grass.

The crow shrieked, a sound so agonizing it seemed to claw at the very air, but Leo just stared, oblivious to its torment.

"Ah..."

Leo dropped the kitchen knife on the grass and scratched his cheek awkwardly, smearing blood across his face.

"I, um… I read in one of Father's books that some birds can fly for months without landing. It made me curious..."

His emerald eyes, so innocent in their gaze, flickered down to the sobbing bird.

"If a bird had no legs, wouldn't it have to fly forever?"

Jeanne's heart plummeted.

Her vision blurred for a moment, her mind struggling to process what she had just heard.

She crouched slowly, not wanting to startle him.

Her hand found the kitchen knife, and she slid it carefully away from his reach.

"Leo..."

She wiped the blood from his cheek with the sleeve of her shirt, her hand shaking.

"Hmm?"

Leo blinked up at her, his face a mask of innocence.

"Don't do this again," she whispered, holding back the tremor in her voice. "I understand you're curious, but you must not."

"Why?"

"Because... it's wrong."

Leo blinked again, tilting his head as though her words were a puzzle he couldn't quite solve.

"Why is it wrong?"

"Because it's cruel, Leo. Hurting others is wrong, whether they're human or animal. We must be kind."

"Kind?"

His eyes flicked back to the crow, which had gone silent in his hand, breath rasping weakly. He seemed puzzled by the concept.

"But… if no one's kind to them, does it really matter?"

Jeanne's throat tightened as she crouched down beside him, pulling him close, burying his face in her chest.

"Being kind will give you much more joy than hurting others. You're still just a child, Leo. There are so many better things you can do... so please, hold back your curiosity, okay?"

"I'll try..."

Jeanne felt his hesitation, sensed that something deep within him had not fully absorbed her words.

His small arms hung limp at his sides as he finally dropped the crow onto the grass.

Its cries had stopped.

And in that moment, Leo learned a lesson, though not the one his mother hoped for.

Cutting off a bird's legs would not make it fly forever.

*****

Azriel stood frozen, his gaze locked on Jeanne.

He couldn't move. That face... It paralyzed him.

His mouth opened and closed, mimicking a fish gasping for air.

But she just smiled at him, softly. Kindly.

'It is just like her…'

"Prince Azriel!"

A voice echoed, and before he could react, a sword burst through the side of her head.

Azriel's eyes widened, his mind blank as he watched.

Jeanne still smiled, her hand resting gently on his cheek, the other clutching the cloth she carried.

The blade jutted out of her skull, but she didn't flinch. Not once. She stood there, unbothered, staring at him with affection.

Then, she crumbled.

Her body disintegrated into black dust, mingling with the dark sand beneath his feet.

"Ah…"

He couldn't think. His mind struggled to grasp the horror of what had just happened.

His eyes fell to the pile of dust.

Bones. Human bones. Nothing more.

Azriel bit his lip.

'It is just like her…'

The thought echoed in his head again..

He turned his gaze away, unwilling to look any longer.

"We should leave now, my prince. This one isn't afraid to confront us. We need to move before its true form finds us," Instructor Kevin said, his hand resting firmly on Azriel's shoulder.

Azriel nodded slowly.

"We must also warn the other groups. The second group is due to enter today… It's unfortunate about all these accidents."

Azriel hummed.

"Yes… it really is."

Instructor Kevin gave him a curt nod and began walking ahead.

The pain, the heat, the cold—they all vanished.

Like it had never happened.

But something loomed closer.

Something they couldn't see.

The Cradler was near.

They could sense it. But how near? How much time did they have left? There was no way to know.

Retreating was the best option.

It should have been.

"My prin—guh!"

Kevin choked mid-sentence.

Azriel turned to see his black katana piercing through the instructor's back, the blade erupting out of his chest, slick with blood.

Kevin's eyes, wide with disbelief, met Azriel's.

Azriel stared back, his lips trembling as he bit down on them, eyes filled with something unreadable.

"Wh... why?"

Kevin's voice broke, his words weak and desperate.

Azriel didn't answer. He gripped the katana, Void Eater, and pulled it free.

Kevin collapsed into the black sand.

Tears streamed down the instructor's face, mingling with the blood spilling from his lips.

His gaze trembled, confused, filled with pain, anger... and sadness.

Azriel walked closer, standing over him, watching.

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Kevin's eyes darted back and forth, searching for an explanation.

"…I'm sorry."

Those were the last words Kevin heard. The last face he saw.

Before everything went black.

*****

A cloud of smoke drifted in front of his face as he held the cigarette between his fingers.

The streets bustled with life, people rushing about, each engrossed in their own little worlds.

He stood out, dressed entirely in black, his hat pulled low over his face.

He wore a long black coat that draped elegantly, paired with tailored black pants and polished black boots.

A classic black tuxedo hat perched atop his head.

In one hand, he held a cigarette, its smoke curling into the night, while the other was clad in sleek black gloves.

As he made his way toward the plaza, his eyes locked on the massive, black hole before him.

The Void Dungeon.

No one was allowed inside—not yet.

The Hero Academy had claimed it for now.

Only the truly mad would willingly sign up for that Academy, knowing they'd have to step foot into that nightmarish abyss.

'So eager to rush toward their deaths...'

He stopped at a safe distance, watching.

A woman stood in front of the dungeon, her back facing it, entirely alone.

Her eyes were closed, yet her brilliant blue hair swayed in the wind.

She wore tight black leather pants that hugged her figure, paired with a fitted charcoal gray jacket that accentuated her silhouette.

The jacket had a subtle sheen, catching the light as she shifted slightly.

On her feet were sleek ankle boots, their smooth leather gleaming under the soft glow of the streetlights.

He couldn't look away.

She captivated him, drew him in, her stillness more magnetic than anything else around.

He wasn't the only one.

All around him, people were sneaking glances or openly staring at her.

She was no ordinary woman.

She was one of the most famous heroes and a prominent instructor at the Hero Academy.

His trance was shattered by the sudden impact of a small body colliding with his leg.

He glanced down to see a boy sprawled on the ground, sobbing, his ice cream splattered across the pavement.

"I... I'm s-sorry."

The man said nothing, only looked at the boy for a moment before pulling a crisp bill worth 100 Velts from his pocket.

Velts.

The currency of the new world, born from the global changes and the collapse of Europe.

All other currencies had been wiped out, replaced by one universal tender—Velts.

The boy's eyes went wide at the sight of the bill.

"Take it," the man said in a low, rumbling voice, "and buy as many as you want."

Despite the fear evident on the boy's face, his eyes sparkled as he took the 100 Velts without hesitation.

"Thank you, mister!"

The boy's face brightened, and the tears vanished as quickly as they'd come.

The child ran off, and the man in black exhaled a sigh, watching him disappear into the crowd.

He raised the cigarette to his lips, ready for a long drag, but was interrupted by a soft, persistent beeping in his pocket.

He pulled out a small device.

Its screen blinked with red dots, beeping steadily.

"So... he's finally done it. Took long enough."

He flicked the cigarette onto the ground, knowing full well it could get him arrested for littering, but he didn't care.

Reaching into his coat, he pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"It's time."

Chapter 89: No Time to Look Back [1]

Void Eater slid effortlessly into the soft flesh of Instructor Kevin's throat, parting skin and muscle with a sickening squelch.

His eyes bulged as his windpipe collapsed around the cold steel, a desperate gurgle bubbling up from the widening wound.

Blood poured from the puncture—first as a trickle, then as a torrent—flooding his mouth and staining his chest dark crimson.

He tried to scream, but the sound was nothing more than a faint, rattling hiss, his body jerking violently as Azriel watched the life drain from his wide, panicked eyes.

Then…

There was no more struggle.

Azriel stared at Kevin's face for several long moments.

He watched.

He watched the body of the man he had killed.

The first human life he had ever taken.

One who died from a stab in the back.

One who had trusted him, only for Azriel to betray that trust.

Removing Void Eater from the wound, he crouched down and pulled a small device from his pocket.

The screen blinked with red dots.

Azriel tucked the device away.

"You didn't even know you had this, did you?"

It was loyalty that had sealed Kevin's fate.

"...."

He stood up—or tried to.

The moment he did, a wave of nausea crashed over him.

"Urgh…!"

His mind buzzed, and his vision blurred.

His throat burned as he coughed, his stomach twisting painfully.

He hunched over, gagging violently.

"Blergghhh!"

It was vomit.

His entire body shook with each heave.

He wiped his mouth with a trembling hand, gasping for air as the sour taste lingered on his tongue.

"Hooo…"

Azriel took deep breaths, grappling with the weight of what he had done.

The mere fact that he had killed someone.

And in such a grotesque manner.

But he had to do it.

Yes.

There was no other way.

No other choice.

The suspicion surrounding Azriel's arm, which could not be healed.

The way he tried to hide his reaction upon hearing Azriel call the person he wished to see the most—his mother.

The fact that he wanted to retreat when Azriel knew he couldn't, no matter what.

And...

The device he had.

Even if he didn't know it himself.

Yes.

Kevin had to die.

"Blergghhh!"

But his body disagreed.

Azriel kept retching.

It wouldn't stop.

No matter how hard he tried to convince himself, the sight of the dead body only sent him spiraling.

Each wave of nausea coated Instructor Kevin's lifeless form with his own vomit, and he continued until—

There was nothing left.

His stomach lay empty.

"...!"

Suddenly, a euphoric sensation began to spread through every inch of Azriel's body.

It was a feeling so intense that he instinctively closed his eyes, surrendering to the pleasure it brought.

Addictive.

It was a sensation he could easily grow accustomed to, even if he didn't want to.

There were no rules against consuming the mana core of a human.

So…

[Core Reaper] would undoubtedly feast on Instructor Kevin's mana core.

"...."

"Hooo…."

After a few deep breaths, he finally stood, Void Eater gripped tightly in his hand.

He looked down at the body now covered in his bile and bit his lip.

It was not over.

He couldn't risk facing a dead version of Kevin.

Tapping his storage ring, a bottle of oil appeared in his hand.

He opened it and poured the contents over Kevin's body, mingling with the remnants of his own sickness.

The stench was revolting, making him gag once more, though there was nothing left to expel.

Dropping the empty bottle, he tapped the ring again, and a box of matches appeared.

Taking one, he struck it against the box, lighting it with a flick.

With a quick motion, he dropped the match onto Kevin's body.

Azriel stepped back, watching as the flames ignited, consuming the corpse in a wild, hungry fire.

Undoubtedly, the blaze would attract other Void creatures and perhaps even the Cradler, but that was good.

Maybe they would destroy each other.

At least he hoped.

The fire blazed brighter, rising higher.

And then…

Azriel turned around.

Moving forward.

*****

Lumine felt his heart quicken at the sight of Cadet Kanae's smile.

Her white eyes and dark grin froze everyone in place—even the instructors.

'What is wrong with her?'

Lumine couldn't tell.

It just… happened.

No one understood why.

Then…

"!!"

His eyes widened.

The cadets screamed in horror.

Blood leaked from her mouth and eyes, but she kept smiling.

"Shit! Ben, what's wrong with her!?"

Instructor Alicia began to panic but didn't dare to approach.

Lumine's expression darkened.

If even the instructors were so unsettled and confused, things were spiraling out of control.

Without warning, she started walking…

Toward the edge of the cliff.

Instructor Alicia and Benson rushed in front of her.

"Cadet Kanae… stop before I have to resort to force."

Ben's narrowed eyes bore into her.

Jasmine flanked them, and together they formed a barrier around Kanae.

Blood continued to trickle from her eyes and mouth, an eerie sight that sent goosebumps crawling over Lumine's skin.

Then…

With a dull thud, she collapsed onto the ground.

Alicia and Benson blinked in confusion before sprinting to her side.

Cautiously, they turned her over.

Her eyes remained open and white, a haunting gaze that met nothingness.

Blood smeared her face, but the smile never left her lips.

Lumine slowly approached alongside Celestina and Jasmine.

His breath caught in his throat.

The cadets screamed once more, some doubled over, vomiting.

Because…

Kanae was dead.

"...."

"She is gone, Alicia..."

Benson took a deep breath, his gaze sweeping over the cadets.

"An anomaly has occurred. No one moves from here until we figure out why Cadet Kanae died. After that, we will have to return to the surface... too many things are going south."

Lumine felt his fingers grow cold.

His mind went blank.

She was dead.

How?

Why?

He didn't know her well, but this was the first time Lumine had seen a dead human.

The urge to vomit clawed at him, but he held it back.

The instructors acted calmly, as did some of the others around him, but he couldn't show weakness here.

"Lumine..."

The voice snapped him out of his stupor.

He turned to his left and saw Yelena standing there, her face pale as she clutched her arms, shivering.

"Yelena, what's wrong?"

Worry gnawed at him as he noticed her abnormal behavior.

Yelena shook her head slowly, looking up at him with wide eyes.

"I don't know, but… it feels like someone is watching me the entire time."

Lumine opened his mouth to dismiss her words, but closed it instantly.

A dead body was here.

And Yelena felt watched.

His silver sword appeared in his hand, catching the attention of Jasmine and Celestina, who approached the duo.

"Did you find a clue?"

Lumine shook his head at Jasmine's question.

"No. But Yelena says she feels like someone is watching her... we might get attacked."

Celestina looked around, confusion etched on her features.

"I don't see anyone watching you, though. Do you know from where?"

Yelena shook her head.

"I don't... it's more like I feel the presence everywhere."

Lumine frowned.

He knew Yelena had incredible instincts, so he wouldn't dismiss her as crazy.
