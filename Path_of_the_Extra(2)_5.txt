"…Very well."

Just like that, the man in black stood up and walked away.

Zoran suddenly turned toward Thomas, looking down at him. Thomas was sweating furiously as he looked at Zoran with fear in his eyes.

"Grandmaster Thomas. I'd like you to answer one thing. Answer me truthfully, and I will spare the life of Princess Celestina Frost. Answer incorrectly, and she dies the most gruesome death possible."

Thomas's face went as pale as it could at Zoran's words.

"Now then, the one who called you here, does he go by the name of Prince Azriel Crimson?"

'Huh...?'

Ranni felt her heart thump as Zoran asked the question. His voice was emotionless the entire time, but the moment he mentioned Azriel's name, it filled with hatred.

'Where is Solomon...? Don't tell me he lost!?'

There was nothing she could do.

The only ones who stood a chance against Zoran at this point were Freya and Solomon. Maybe even Salvator.

"...Y-yes. He was the one who contacted me privately, telling me that the sacred capital was going to be attacked, and I couldn't tell anyone—not even my king."

Zoran nodded as Thomas didn't hesitate. His loyalty was never to Azriel. If he had to choose between Celestina and Azriel, he would pick Celestina instantly, as much as it hurt him.

"…So he really knew."

With that, Zoran suddenly walked toward the void dungeon.

Ranni did not turn her head as Zoran ignored her presence and walked into the black hole.

In an instant, it swallowed him whole.

The pressure instantly disappeared with his departure.

The man in black was gone.

The fighting and chaos continued, yet...

Ranni and Thomas did not move.

Chapter 96: Birth of Genesis [2]

'So this is what he looks like when he's serious?'

Instructor Benson narrowed his eyes as he stopped a few meters in front of Azriel.

During the fight against the Cradler, Benson had occasionally glimpsed at Azriel's battle.

There was nothing particularly noteworthy—except for that odd sword art.

His own fight with the Cradler hadn't been too difficult.

As he expected, the abomination specialized in mind attacks.

But Benson excelled at resisting such assaults.

For someone of the same mana core level to affect him mentally would have been nearly impossible.

And since the Cradler lacked skill in close combat, it didn't take him long to finish it.

But still, it was a strange creature—surviving decapitation, needing to have its heart and mana core ripped out.

And the strangest part?

It only seemed to care about Azriel.

'Yes, it was definitely odd. But that was all.'

At least, as far as the Cradler was concerned.

Azriel's blank, emotionless face hadn't changed during his fight against the two intermediate ranks earlier.

They weren't bad fighters—neither the best nor the worst in their rank.

Yet they hadn't even had the chance to use their [Unique Skill], thanks to Azriel.

Still, Azriel had been injured.

Not badly, but enough to notice.

'He held back, yet allowed himself to get hurt?'

It annoyed Benson, a peculiar mix of frustration and intrigue, as if he was being taken seriously and dismissed at the same time.

In his eyes, the battle had already been decided.

He had a soul weapon, and was of a higher mana core level.

Defeat was inevitable.

Azriel stopped a few meters away, his face as emotionless as ever.

Then...

Benson lunged at him, moving so fast the air rippled and the ground exploded in his wake.

In a heartbeat, he was in front of Azriel, his lance aimed straight for the boy's crimson eye.

But at the last possible second, Azriel dodged, tilting his head to the left.

Not wasting a moment, Azriel countered, thrusting Void Eater, now crackling with red lightning, toward Benson's obsidian eye.

But Benson was still faster.

Effortlessly, he spun his lance, its hilt clashing against Void Eater's blade, redirecting the strike past his head.

With a swift kick to Azriel's chest, he sent the boy flying. Azriel rolled across the ground but got back up almost immediately, his body visibly injured, though he showed no signs of pain.

He stood, Void Eater in front of him, lightning crackling ominously.

'...He's not using his ice affinity. Is it due to a lack of mana? Or is he less proficient with it compared to his lightning?'

It had been a shock to discover that Azriel had two affinities. But the boy was still too young to make both a true threat.

That didn't mean Benson would be reckless.

His experience had taught him never to underestimate his opponent.

Azriel made the next move.

Using [Death's Blossom], he closed the distance in an instant.

Benson, narrowing his eyes, dodged the first strike aimed at his heart.

A trail of black smoke, laced with lightning, followed Azriel's movements as Benson blocked the second attack—a slash intended to cut across his abdomen.

To his surprise, Azriel didn't retreat.

Instead, his blade slid off the lance, thrusting Void Eater toward Benson's neck.

But it wasn't fast enough.

Instead of dodging or blocking with his lance, Benson caught Void Eater with his bare hand, his armor cracking under the strain.

Blood dripped from his palm as it hit the ground, but Void Eater was stuck, unable to move.

Azriel didn't push. Instead, he released his grip, leaping back before desummoning and re-summoning Void Eater.

Benson watched him carefully, their eyes locking.

"You've got an astounding mana capacity and regeneration," Benson remarked.

"to use your affinity and sword art multiple times... and even summon and dismiss your soul weapon without hesitation."

In battle, everything cost mana. Without mana, one would lose.

'His mana capacity rivals mine...'

But what concerned Benson more was that Azriel's mana regeneration was superior.

Meaning, at this point, Azriel likely had more mana left than he did.

'Still... he can't win. So what's he planning?'

A sigh escaped his lips.

"Out of respect, I won't hold back anymore."

With a sudden kick off the ground, Benson lunged at Azriel, arriving in front of him much faster than before.

Azriel didn't even have time to blink before Benson's lance was thrust toward his heart.

Lightning crackled around Azriel's body as he managed to shift to the side, but he wasn't fast enough.

The lance sliced into his ribs, blood seeping from the wound.

Benson didn't relent. With a swift motion, his bleeding right hand shot forward, gripping Azriel's left arm.

He hurled him like a rag doll, sending him crashing into the spot where Benson had stood moments before. The floor cracked beneath Azriel's impact.

Benson remained motionless, then threw his lance directly at Azriel.

Azriel's emotionless eyes caught sight of the weapon just in time. Pushing himself off the ground, he rolled aside as the lance pierced the floor where he had lain.

Instructor Benson watched as Azriel stood, blood dripping onto the floor from his body.

Suddenly, a subtle shift occurred on Azriel's blank face.

His eyes opened a little more—just slightly.

Without warning, the armor on Benson's left arm began to crumble, black shards falling to the ground, leaving his arm exposed. But it didn't end there.

No.

The black shards from his armor trembled, then began to rise into the air, spinning...

And with a sharp whistle, they shot toward Azriel, slicing through the air.

*****

Azriel narrowed his eyes as the black shards rushed toward him. There were too many to count.

Everything around him seemed drained of color.

'Magnetism.'

That was Instructor Benson's affinity.

Azriel had been wrong—Benson wasn't wearing soul armor. The black material covering his body wasn't armor at all. It was magnets, acting as both defense and weapon.

As the magnetic shards flew at him, Azriel didn't bother to dodge or block. It would have been pointless.

Instead, he leaped back, forming a wall of ice in front of him. The shards collided with the ice, piercing it, some grazing his body and leaving shallow cuts.

But in the end, the ice held.

Just before crumbling under the weight of the black shards.

Azriel's gaze followed Benson as he calmly walked forward, retrieving his lance from the ground.

Benson raised his left arm, and the black shards trembled before shooting back toward him, reassembling to form his armor once more.

'There's no point.'

That was the only conclusion Azriel reached after engaging with Benson.

There was no point in trying to fight.

No point in killing.

He couldn't win against Benson, who had far more experience.

It was impossible.

All he would be doing was wasting his mana.

Which was already running out.

The Cradler hadn't weakened Benson the way Azriel had hoped. And using [Void Mind] was draining his mana even faster.

Soon, it would consume the last of his reserves.

Then, defeat would be inevitable.

Azriel's eyes darted around the cave, taking in the bridge, the dark surroundings.

He closed his eyes.

'There's no other choice.'

Not if he wanted to win.

So...

He deactivated [Void Mind].

"Urgh…"

Azriel held his head, wincing.

It was a nauseating feeling as colors flooded back into his vision so suddenly.

Instructor Benson stopped in his tracks, looking confused and wary at the abrupt change.

With a grim expression, Azriel composed himself. He had hoped that perhaps he could find a way to win using [Void Mind], but deep down, he knew he was too weak.

Not strong enough.

If only he weren't alone—if Lumine or Nol were here, he might have stood a chance. But they weren't. He trusted Nol with the cadets and needed Lumine there as insurance.

Azriel had to finish this without their help.

Time was ticking.

He blinked, and suddenly, Instructor Benson was right in front of him.

Raising Void Eater to parry the lance, Azriel was taken by surprise when Benson released his grip, the weapon clattering to the floor with an echo.

With both hands, Benson gripped the blade of Void Eater.

"…!"

Azriel's eyes widened.

Benson's hands bled profusely as the blade sank into his palms, yet he held on, gritting his teeth.

'Suicidal maniac…!'

"Gah!"

A sudden kick struck Azriel's abdomen, blood spilling from his mouth.

But Azriel didn't release Void Eater.

Neither did Benson.

A sharp cracking sound reached Azriel's ears.

'No…'

It was Void Eater.

His expression turned dire as the blade succumbed to the pressure.

Desperately, Azriel summoned his lightning affinity, letting it wrap around Void Eater.

"Ghh…!"

The lightning burned Benson's skin, but he didn't relent.

"...."

'...Ah, I really hate this.'

With no other choice, and cracks forming on the obsidian blade, Azriel desummoned Void Eater.

The moment he did, he barely had time to react as Instructor Benson gripped the side of his head and sent him crashing to the ground.

"Argh!"

Chapter 97: Birth of Genesis [3]

The difference between an intermediate-ranked and an advanced-ranked might not seem huge.

But it was.

Especially if someone like Azriel, lacking the experience, had to fight against a monster like Benson—someone who had remained at that rank for nearly his entire life.

Each mana core level, except for the dormant one, unlocked something unique, the same for everyone.

Once a human became Awakened, they unlocked their affinities—like Azriel, who had the rare dual affinities of ice and lightning.

But when someone reached the intermediate rank, the game changed.

They unlocked what was called [Soul Veins], a term self-coined by humans.

Strangely, it was as if the status screen every human relied on skipped the part where [Soul Veins] were mentioned—nobody knew why.

[Soul Veins] were something that, unlocked at the intermediate level, caused an internal mana burst that enhanced specific veins in the body. These veins increased mana flow, improved control, and sped up spell casting while boosting efficiency.

It made them obviously stronger than an Awakened.

But once a human reached the advanced rank, that's when everything began to shift, as if preparing them for the higher levels.

[Soul Rebirth], named by the status screen, was something every human underwent upon reaching the advanced rank. It triggered a transformation of the physical body, drastically enhancing strength, agility, endurance, and durability.

Azriel hadn't reached the advanced rank yet. He hadn't gone through [Soul Rebirth] like Jasmine had.

With Benson's experience and superior body, how could Azriel possibly win a duel against him?

Not even [Void Mind] gave him an edge in this fight.

At least he wasn't facing someone of expert rank or higher.

Those who had unlocked [Soul Echo] were truly impossible for someone like Azriel to take on alone.

And a master-ranked individual—someone who had undergone a second [Soul Rebirth] to prepare for becoming a Grandmaster, who are capable of using [Soul Anchor]—would have been even worse. A Grandmaster could open void rifts and place anchors on both Earth and the Void Realm.

But in the end, none of that mattered right now.

What mattered most was that Azriel couldn't win this duel against Benson.

*****

Azriel hit the ground hard, the impact sending shockwaves through his body. Searing pain shot through his skull, and the world blurred and twisted, a piercing ring echoing in his ears.

The metallic taste of blood filled his mouth. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand, feeling the warm streak of it smear across his skin.

Each breath was a struggle, as if he were inhaling shards of glass that scraped at his throat.

"What was that term again... ah yes, a masochist! Brat, are you sure you're not one of them?"

Azriel's vision sharpened just enough to make out the figure—Leo's mocking face standing in front of him. Hatred boiled inside Azriel, but he couldn't do much. Barely parting his lips, he muttered.

"...Fuck... off."

Before he could react, his vision tilted again. He was thrown closer to the giant gate.

"Ugh..."

"Cursing your instructor is an act of defiance, Prince Azriel."

His head throbbed. He barely managed to turn and see Benson walking towards him.

"...Fuck... off."

But Benson didn't.

His lance flew straight at Azriel once again.

Azriel's eyes widened—he wasn't fast enough. The lance pierced his left shoulder, and he was thrown against the gate.

"Mngh!"

It hurt. A lot. Worse still, he had to avoid looking at the ruins, or his head might literally split open.

Benson reached him, pulling the lance from his shoulder. Azriel clenched his teeth so hard they nearly cracked, stifling a scream. His heartbeat pounded painfully through his body.

'...Not yet.'

Sudden alarm bells rang in his head, his body tense with instinctual dread.

"Goodbye... I hope one day you forgive me, my prince."

Benson loomed over him, raising the lance above his head. In a downward swing, he aimed to end it all.

'No...'

If that hit, he'd die. He'd have to do it all over again, just to fail once more.

Azriel couldn't allow that.

Out of sheer desperation, he gritted his teeth and kicked the ground.

The lance cut down, but Azriel shot forward, stumbling immediately. He fell behind Benson's back.

And then—

"AARGH!"

A scream tore from his throat. Pain coursed through him like a relentless wave, consuming his senses.

He glanced to his side as he lay on his stomach. There, in front of him, was...

his hand.

His right hand.

"Haa... ha... haaa..."

He released a shaky breath, his vision blurring with tears. Blinking them away, he rolled onto his back.

Opening his eyes again, he looked toward where his right hand had once been.

"!!"

Blood poured from the severed stump, pooling on the ground like a dark stain spreading across the cold earth.

"Ah, fuck! Dammit, it fucking hurts!"

The words escaped without him even realizing. His eyes, now red from tears, stung with pain.

Summoning his ice affinity, Azriel quickly formed ice around the wound, stopping the blood flow.

For now.

"...I don't understand why you're prolonging your death, my prince. You're only making yourself suffer."

Azriel glared at Benson, who watched him with a stoic face.

'Not yet...'

A twisted smile crept across Azriel's bloodied lips before a wince wiped it away.

"I... I told you... I'm terrible at... dying."

Every movement felt like his nerves were being slashed by a knife, but slowly, he picked up his severed hand, placing it in his storage ring. His body swayed, nearly collapsing again.

"Mm... indeed, you are."

'Now.'

With the last remnants of strength and mana, Azriel's body crackled with lightning.

Then he ran.

Leaving a trail of red lightning behind, he bolted to the other side of the bridge—the entrance to the cave—far from the gate that led to the third floor, where Benson stood.

Benson didn't chase him. He simply watched, disappointment flickering in his eyes.

"So, you've abandoned your pride for the sake of a few more seconds of life."

The black shards crumbled from his left arm, rose, and began spinning.

Then they shot forward.

They pierced Azriel's back and legs. He screamed in agony, tumbling forward and rolling across the cold floor.

He didn't reach the bridge's entrance, but he had gone far enough.

That's all that mattered.

Benson jerked his hand, and the shards returned to him. Azriel rolled onto his back, coughing violently, his lungs burning as blood dripped from his mouth.

His back was bleeding now too, but using the last of his ice affinity, he sealed the wounds.

It still hurt like hell.

But it didn't matter anymore.

It was over.

Azriel turned his head, looking at Benson, who stood still, watching him with a solemn expression.

Maybe Benson thought it was over too.

That might have been why he spoke, his voice echoing through the silent cave.

"...You asked me earlier why I did what I did."

Benson closed his eyes for a moment before opening them again, but before he could speak further, Azriel interrupted.

"It's alright, Instructor... I know."

Benson's eyes widened in surprise.

It hurt to speak, but Azriel endured.

"... I know why you did what you did. A former member of Neo Genesis, retired, but forced back into action for one final mission. You... got assigned as one of the instructors in charge of the class the Apex is in... and eliminate him, all while wearing a device that revealed your location to the other members of Neo Genesis...

who snuck in with the second group. They were waiting for you to make your move, making sure the first group was... gathered in one place."

Azriel looked at the petrified Benson.

"Instructor Kevin and Instructor Alicia, one... of the few people you cared for the most... you planted those devices in their pockets without them ever noticing. One of them is gone now..."

Benson's face darkened, but Azriel continued.

"...You had no choice. Your family was threatened. Kill the Apex, or your wife and kids die. You knew they would actually do it... but... there's no point going into further detail.

What's done is done..."

"...."

"...If you knew, why didn't you stop me?" Benson's voice cracked.

"You... you could have prevented all of this! The cadets that might already be dead... the people on the surface! What were you thinking!?"

Benson's composure shattered like broken glass, and he screamed at Azriel, tears streaming down his face.

"You knew everything from the start! And instead of telling anyone and stopping this madness, you led me here! For what? To die alone here? Did you seriously think you could win against me on your own!?"

Benson collapsed to his knees, wiping his tears away.

It was strange, seeing the normally stoic instructor break down. It revealed just how much he had been hiding all this time.

"Yes, my family would've died... yes, I would've been executed. But at least it would've ended there. No one else would have had to die..!"

Azriel painfully moved his head, staring up at the vault of the cave, a tired sigh escaping his lips.

"...."

"...I wanted to cut off its legs."

"...What?"

Benson looked at Azriel, confused, his tear-filled eyes narrowing.

"I wanted to cut off the bird's legs... that's it. You and your family were just part of that... someone innocent, caught in a game you had no business being in. Like all the others that have died today... and will die."

A faint, tired smile appeared on Azriel's face.

"...The only time she looked at me was when I did things... I wasn't supposed to. It was the only way I learned to get the attention of the person I wanted. Whoever had to suffer as a consequence didn't matter to me."

Benson stared at him, his lips tightly pursed, not understanding.

Azriel slowly turned his face toward Benson. Their eyes met.

"I'm sorry you had to suffer because of me, Instructor... If it gives you any consolation, when all of this is over... I'll make sure your family gets somewhere safe."

"...Safe?" Benson repeated, confused.

Why would Azriel be the one to send his family somewhere safe?

Suddenly, Azriel tapped his storage ring, and a small device appeared in his hand. It looked like a remote, with a single black button on it.

It started beeping.

"Honor, fairness, and pride... sometimes you can't win with those things. Sometimes, you have to abandon them to come out on top."

Hearing those words, the hair on Benson's body stood on end. His heart pounded in his ears, and a cold wave of dread washed over him.

He stood up and ran.

But...

"Goodbye... I hope one day you forgive me, Instructor."

It was too late.

Azriel pressed the button.

"...!"

The bridge beneath Benson detonated in a violent eruption, the shockwave tearing through the air like a thunderclap.

Chunks of stone were hurled skyward, spinning as they rained down in deadly arcs.

Azriel barely had time to react before the force slammed into him, sending him sprawling even more backward.

The ground beneath him trembled, groaning under the strain as his half of the bridge cracked and, some shards of stone breaking away and plummeting into the void below.

Then... silence fell once again.

Azriel's half of the broken bridge was all that remained, except for the giant gate on the other side that stood without a scratch.

And...

in front of Azriel's eyes was a severed hand, wearing a wedding ring.

Then...

after a few more seconds of silence, a wave of euphoria surged through his entire body.

Chapter 98: We Are All Liars Here [1]

Yelena sat next to Lumine, who had his eyes closed, sitting cross-legged on the dirt.

If someone were to observe closely, they'd notice the air around him subtly shifting, being drawn toward him.

He was absorbing the mana in the air.

'Even now, he still chooses to train…'

Yelena smiled faintly, glancing at the other cadets. Nothing had really changed.

Except… for a few people who weren't here.

And the strangest part?

This entire time, she felt like someone had been watching her every move, making her skin crawl.

But when they all left... so did the gaze.

It was uncomfortable.

Why did they leave?

No one had noticed yet, but soon they would.

And where did they go?

So many things didn't make sense about this void dungeon trip.

Yelena's eyes drifted toward Jasmine, now chatting with some of the cadets.

Why was she even here?

A guide only allowed to act after the second day, following the first group and then permitted to guide anyone else, speeding things up.

But why?

None of it added up.

It didn't matter now though, not with the trip getting canceled.

Yelena prided herself on her ability to read people, a skill she had developed since childhood as Lumine's best friend.

Lumine always saw the best in people, which often made him a target for those with bad intentions.

She felt like it was her responsibility to protect him.

She trusted Jasmine—Jasmine seemed like a good person.

But her brother?

Her thoughts clouded when it came to Azriel.

She couldn't decide whether he was good or bad. It hadn't even been a week, but in that time, Lumine and Azriel had grown close.

And yet... she couldn't bring herself to trust him.

Then, there was the silver-haired boy who caught her eye, walking casually.

Nol.

He was smiling as if nothing was wrong.

Just like Azriel, she didn't trust him either.

Something about him felt... off. It was different from Azriel, but there was an eerie similarity she couldn't pinpoint.

It had become a habit, silently observing Azriel.

She tried to figure out who he really was, but there was nothing explicitly wrong about him.

And Nol?

She barely knew him, having never spoken to him directly.

Lumine always had to play the middleman with anyone that approached the two of them.

Without him, Yelena probably wouldn't talk to anyone.

'Hmm?'

Her brow furrowed as she noticed Nol walking toward Instructor Alicia. Glancing at Lumine, still deep in his trance, Yelena quietly stood up, moving closer to them, unnoticed.

"…Instructor, I... I don't feel so well…"

Nol's voice was weak, his hand clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet. Alicia furrowed her brows, concerned.

"You're Cadet Nol, right?"

Nol nodded weakly, his face grim.

"I… I'd like to request to go back to the surface... I don't think I can handle this anymore…"

Alicia's expression softened with concern as Nol grew paler.

"Unfortunately, I can't take you. Could you hold on until the second group arrives? It should only be a day or so, unless they split up, which seems unlikely."

Nol shook his head, pain clear on his face.

"P-please, Instructor… I don't think I can wait that long…"

A troubled look crossed Alicia's face. If she let Nol go, others might want to leave too.

And with everything going on…

"What if I escort him to the surface, Instructor?" a voice interrupted.

Both Alicia and Nol turned, their gazes landing on Jasmine. Her eyes flickered from Nol to Alicia, who looked taken aback.

"But…"

"Technically, my presence isn't required here, and the situation seems under control now. It's fine if I take him to the surface, right?"

Yelena swallowed nervously.

Jasmine's voice, her expression—it wasn't a request.

Alicia hesitated, but seeing no other option, nodded reluctantly.

"Alright... but be careful."

Jasmine nodded, stepping forward.

Nol, still pale, followed behind. But then Yelena noticed something—something small but impossible to miss.

'Huh…?'

Just as Nol passed the distracted Alicia, his hand moved swiftly—so fast it was almost a blur.

He took something from her pocket. Yelena's eyes widened slightly.

She watched Nol walk away, but then… he looked back.

Their eyes locked.

A smirk crept onto Nol's face, and he pressed a finger to his lips before his expression turned pained again.

Yelena blinked, watching as he and Jasmine approached the platform.

Then… they were swallowed by the small black hole.

*****

"You'd better start explaining what's going on, Nol."

Jasmine stood in front of Nol, her gaze sharp, as they faced the boss gate of the first floor.

It was still closed, meaning the second group hadn't arrived yet.

Nol smiled, casually playing with the device in his hands—the same one that Instructor Benson and Instructor Kevin had.

Jasmine's eyes narrowed as she watched him, her patience clearly thinning. With a sigh, Nol sat down cross-legged on the ground, his expression thoughtful.

"Where to begin…"

He scratched his head, furrowing his brows as if deciding where to start.

"Well... let's say there's a little terrorist organization called Neo Genesis that's trying to kill all of us. Master was assigned a mission by the headmistress… a few members of Neo Genesis managed to stay hidden in the void dungeon. They've been waiting in the tunnels leading down the cliff on the second floor.

Master anticipated that, so he climbed down ahead of time, acting clueless and scared since Instructor Benson was watching him."

Nol paused, his tone casual despite the gravity of what he was saying. Jasmine remained silent, but her posture stiffened.

"Cadet Kanae, the one who died—that was because of one of Neo Genesis' abilities and her death was intended as a signal. Instructor Benson, one of the traitors, had to rethink his plans since Instructor Kevin decided to follow Master, who isn't a traitor, by the way. Meanwhile, Benson made sure the rest of Neo Genesis stayed hidden.

What Instructor Kevin didn't realize was that this sort of device"—Nol held up the small contraption—"had been slipped into his pocket. Same with Instructor Alicia. It allowed every Neo Genesis member on the same floor with such a device to track each others exact location."

Nol took a deep breath, letting his words sink in before continuing.

"Master knew Benson and his men were tailing him, so he led them to a place to deal with them. By now, he's probably taken them out. We, on the other hand, should be getting ready for Phase Two of the plan."

Nol smiled up at Jasmine, who was still processing everything he had just told her.

"Does that give you the gist of what's happening, my lady?"

Jasmine's face went pale as the gravity of Nol's words sank in.

"You... are you telling me Azriel just led multiple members of a terrorist organization and Benson, who's a Grade 3 Advanced—a fighter even I'd be cautious of—into some random place to fight on his own?"

Nol blinked, then a bright smile spread across his face, and he nodded enthusiastically.

"Exactly! As expected of you, my lady—your brilliance knows no limits!"

Veins bulged on Jasmine's forehead as she snapped, "Clearly yours and Azriel's does! Have the two of you, along with Freya, lost your minds!?"

A wave of panic washed over her.

"We need to go back... Azriel can't handle Instructor Benson and those others all by himself!"

Nol looked at her, puzzled.

"Why not? Master has been planning this for a long time. Instructor Benson and his lackeys' deaths are inevitable—if it hasn't already happened. You should trust Master more."

Knowledge is power.

Only those who possessed it and wielded it wisely would come out on top.

"Nol."

Nol froze at the sudden change in her tone.

"...Y-yes?"

An awkward smile crept onto his face.

"You speak of trusting Azriel more, but shouldn't he be doing the same? Why didn't he tell me? Why didn't he ask for my help? I thought we'd gotten closer since he returned. His death broke me and Mom. Dad...

he acted like he didn't even care, just kept working like always, being the indifferent king he is... acting like it didn't matter."

Jasmine clenched her fists.

"When Azriel came back, everything finally started to heal again. Mom's been trying to be better... and Dad... I realized he's just terrible at showing emotions. But thanks to Azriel, he's been trying again. I've made peace with them, all thanks to him.

But then Azriel himself... why does he always keep a certain distance? Why doesn't he talk about his nightmares? Does he even care..?"

She looked into Nol's eyes. There were no tears.

She just looked... sad.

The smile on Nol's face faded, replaced by an unreadable expression as he listened quietly.

After a moment, he spoke.

"Master never wanted you to be in harm's way because of his plans. He still doesn't. You coming on this trip... that was something he didn't expect, just like the floor shifts that have happened. But that doesn't mean he doesn't trust you."

Jasmine's confusion deepened as Nol continued.

"The moment you came here, Master knew I'd use it to our advantage. He could have stopped me from being here with you—I could've picked Lumine instead. But he didn't. He knew I'd have to tell you most of what's going on. And yet, he never approached me. He allowed it all to happen...

because he trusted both of us to handle it."

"..."

"Right now, the second group is infiltrated by Neo Genesis members. They're going to kill all the cadets on the second floor. We're here to stop them and take them down. Honestly, I could've handled it myself... but I wouldn't miss the chance to fight side by side with the person Master cares for most in this world."

"...Azriel cares most for me...?"

Nol smiled.

"Of course. Surely you've noticed. Knowing Master, he must've told you in his own way."

Jasmine furrowed her brows. Azriel telling her about Neo Genesis? About how much he cares?

Suddenly, her eyes widened.

She remembered that day—when Azriel fell asleep on her lap, muttering about doing something... stupid. And whether or not she'd hate him...

'He warned me... before it even began.'

She felt a strange surge of happiness. It was stupid, how happy she felt, but then—

A sudden shiver ran down her spine. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead.

'Just... how much did he predict?'

Did he know every step that would be taken today?

She didn't know how to feel.

But she didn't have time to process it, because—

A crushing pressure forced her to her knees.

"!?"

She couldn't stand. Her body felt impossibly heavy. She managed to lift her head, barely, and saw Nol.

He was still seated, cross-legged, but he struggled to raise his head, a troubled smile on his face.

"...He's here."

Chapter 99: We Are All Liars Here [2]

Celestina butchered the void creatures, one by one.

A swarm of them... or was.

Her armor, hair, and face were smeared with their blood.

Bodies littered the ground around her, void creatures in various states of death.

At first, it seemed like there would be no end to them. The more she slaughtered, the more they multiplied.

Yet... Celestina never retreated.

Like a silver-haired maiden of death, she moved through the carnage with a smile on her face.

The more she killed, the better she felt.

Each swing of her sword only fueled her hatred for them.

She loathed them, each and every one.

Her blade dripped with their blood until none were left—except for one.

It stood in front of her.

Celestina grew tired of seeing the same abominations the further she ventured into the tunnel.

This one screeched, echoing off the walls.

It spread its black wings wide, trying to imitate her.

No beak, only rows of sharp, needle-like teeth where one should have been, as if torn away like the others.

Its eyes were red where white should be.

She realized as she fought them—these creatures were blind.

They couldn't see, not in the conventional sense.

They had adapted to the darkness, to the faint light of the torches and the darkness of this dungeon.

They were ruthless.

But Celestina was worse.

The creature's talons dug into the floor as it looked past her at the trail of corpses she'd left behind.

Celestina wondered how the world looked to it.

How did it see without sight?

A smile crept across her lips.

"Why aren't you attacking me like the others?" Her voice was a mocking whisper.

"Are you... afraid?"

The bird-creature cocked its head, its torn mouth opening with another screech, its teeth clacking together like bones snapping.

Then it flew at her, wings flapping furiously, screeching in rage.

'Did it understand me?'

Celestina didn't waste time. She raised her left palm. What are creatures that dwell in darkness most sensitive to?

Light.

A white glow erupted from her hand, flooding the tunnel.

The creature screeched in agony, thrashing in the air, disoriented by the sudden burst.

That was her moment.

Celestina charged, sword in hand, and in one swift motion, severed its head.

It fell with a dull thud as blood spurted from its neck.

She barely noticed the blood anymore. She was drenched in it.

Sighing, she scanned the tunnel.

"No more of you?"

"Not quite."

Celestina's eyes widened, her grip tightening on her sword as she whirled around.

Footsteps echoed closer, the torchlight flickering to reveal a familiar face. She froze.

"...Cadet Vergil?"

Vergil's features came into focus as he approached slowly, hands raised in a gesture of peace, a small smile playing on his lips.

"Before you get the wrong idea, princess, I only followed you out of curiosity. You were tailing Instructor Benson, and well... I saw the men with him. I hid and watched the whole time as you fought these creatures…"

Celestina exhaled, lowering her sword. She glanced at the carnage around her, then back at Vergil, who still held his hands up.

"For the record, I won't steal your mana cores. You deserve them, seeing as you did all the killing…"

A slight smirk curled her lips as she narrowed her eyes.

"It's also only fair you help me collect them. After all, you let me do all the fighting while using my back as a shield."

Vergil's smile twitched as he lowered his hands, glancing at the pile of bodies with a grimace.

"...There are a lot of bodies. Bloody, dead bodies, princess…"

Her smile widened.

"Looks like you're wide awake for once. Better hurry if we want to find out what else is down here."

"B-But..."

"I'm not asking, Cadet."

Her words were cold, making Vergil shiver. An awkward laugh escaped his lips.

"Right, right... honored to help, princess. Truly."

He muttered something under his breath as he approached one of the corpses, pulling out a dagger from his storage ring and starting to carve out the mana cores.

"Why do I keep getting involved with these great children... Do I have a death wish?"

Celestina smiled at his muttering, then followed his lead, using her sword to extract a core from the body beside her.

It took a while to open the bodies, extract the mana cores, and consume each one. The process was slow and gruesome.

Celestina's hands were slick with blood as she carefully cut into each corpse, her sword slicing through the blackened flesh of the void creatures.

But eventually, Celestina finished.

Naturally, she didn't consume all of them. She handed some to Vergil—not out of kindness, but because they would have been wasted otherwise.

It could be dangerous to consume too many, and she couldn't keep them either. Time wasn't on their side. So, the leftovers went to Vergil.

After that, they walked forward in silence. Neither spoke—there wasn't much to say, and they weren't close enough to have conversations like friends. Eventually, though, they stopped.

Because they had no choice.

Celestina and Vergil stood frozen, staring at what lay ahead.

Darkness.

The torches ended here. Ahead, there was only an abyss, a wall of impenetrable black. Neither of them could see through it.

A shiver ran down Celestina's spine.

'Do we have to walk through this?'

It was unsettling. She wasn't alone—Vergil was with her—but... who or what else might be in there?

Instructor Benson and his men went through this place for a reason...

She hesitated. Should they retreat? Wait? Or go?

There were plenty of options, yet none seemed right.

"...Princess, if you wish to go forward, I'll go with you," Vergil said, his voice tight. "But... I really suggest we just take a nap here and wait."

His face was pale, his eyes glued to the darkness ahead.

It was clear he didn't want to proceed, and Celestina didn't blame him.

They had followed Instructor Benson into the unknown, and what lay ahead seemed even more so.

'Too many damned anomalies...'

"Let's—"

"If you both step forward, I'll have to break my promise to Grandmaster Thomas."

"!!"

Celestina and Vergil whipped around, freezing in place.

'Ah...'

Celestina's face paled, her body trembling.

The figure before them stood barely illuminated by the torches—a living shadow, its eyes wide and white.

It had no mouth, yet it stared at them as if it could peer directly into their souls.

It was terrifying.

"There's no need to frighten children, I suppose."

Then, it disappeared.

In its place, a man appeared—short black hair blending with the tunnels, dark blue eyes. He no longer looked frightening, but Celestina still couldn't move.

The man walked toward them, hands behind his back, calm and confident. His presence reminded Celestina of her father. A king.

Her eyes locked with his.

"Princess Celestina Frost... and," his gaze shifted, landing on Vergil, "Vergil... a little brother of mine, in another way."

Vergil pursed his lips.

'They're brothers...?'

Celestina couldn't make sense of his words.

Standing before them now, the man smiled slightly.

"So young, the both of you... It wasn't supposed to be like this. We weren't supposed to meet today, and especially not here, but..."

His face darkened, his head tilting slightly as a sigh escaped his lips.

"His presence has ensured that from now on, nothing will go as it should have."

He looked toward the darkness ahead.

"Despite my promise to Grandmaster Thomas not to kill you, neither of you is ready to walk forward. You're not prepared to sacrifice what's needed. Without it, you'll wander in that darkness for the rest of your lives, with no escape."

Celestina felt her throat dry up as she swallowed hard. She didn't know this man—but he knew her.

He knew Vergil.

He knew Thomas, and he had made some kind of promise.

"But even if you do walk forward, it won't matter. Either I or he will take your lives."

She didn't ask him his name or anything else.

It wasn't that he was exerting any pressure or doing anything to frighten them. It was just his... presence.

Celestina couldn't find it in herself to speak, even though she had so many questions.

The man sighed again, then started walking past them. Celestina watched his back as he moved away.

"I wish I could have fought both of you when you were stronger," he said, his voice laced with disappointment.

Regret.

And just like that, he walked into the darkness, leaving the two of them bewildered and confused.

Vergil, standing beside Celestina, let out a shaky breath.

"Princess... I really suggest we retreat right now. I might've been a Void Streamer once, but I'm retired now... and these are the kinds of messed-up things that make you retire—or die young."

Celestina's grip on her sword tightened as she kept staring at where the man had disappeared into the darkness.

'That man... he's a Saint... why?'

Why would someone like him be here?

"Just what is going on?"

Chapter 100: We Are All Liars Here [3]

With a groan, Azriel pushed himself up with his remaining hand, struggling to stand. He was drained, exhausted.

Letting out an audible sigh, he tapped his storage ring and drank a health potion. Then tossed the empty vial to the ground.

Then another.

And another.

Until there were none left.

"That feels much better..." he muttered, closing his eyes to savor the peace and quiet that followed.

No one was left.

Everyone who entered this cave had died—all except for him.

And Leo.

Unwillingly, Azriel opened his eyes, seeing Leo standing in front of him.

"I didn't want to use it on him. I tried to find another way, but..." Azriel trailed off.

"There wasn't another way," Leo cut in.

"It's not that it's impossible for you to defeat an advanced-ranked, but it was impossible for you to defeat Instructor Benson fairly."

Azriel nodded as he limped toward the edge of the bridge.

"The strongest mana bomb currently in existence—capable of doing heavy damage to an advanced-ranked at point-blank range—and even then, that instructor of yours survived."

Leo walked forward, standing next to Azriel as he stared down into the darkness below.

"Though it's better to say that falling into the void... that nothingness... is what killed him. Erased him. Maybe his body is still falling, maybe he's conscious, but Benson is dead. He's nothing now."

"That's good to know..." Azriel muttered.

Leo's laughter echoed madly.

"Good, he says!"

"I didn't mean it like that," Azriel clarified. "It's good to know that [Core Reaper] works this way. How else would I know what counts as a kill? If I pushed someone, would the fall count as mine or the height's? Now I know—as long as I'm the reason, it's enough."

A twisted smile crept across Leo's face as he looked at Azriel.

"Still, planting that bomb without falling into the void? That took guts—something you clearly lack."

Azriel didn't respond. He slowly sat down, biting his lip as his body screamed in pain.

He sat dangerously close to the edge, cross-legged. Leo's smile widened as he leaned in, his head almost resting on Azriel's left shoulder.

"You're almost at the end. You deceived the headmistress, fooled the instructors, tricked Grandmaster Thomas into leaving the Frost King's side... You lied to everyone just to get here—all for this reckless gamble."

Leo's grin widened even more as Azriel stared down into the abyss.

"A reckless, stupid gamble. You didn't care about the lives of others or the deaths of others. If you win, you're the hero. If you lose, you're the villain. Which will it be, I wonder?"

Azriel clenched his teeth, glaring at Leo, who seemed even more amused by the reaction.

"You sacrificed your hand, and your trust—all to come out on top. But why?"

"Why?"

"Yes, why? We talked about this at the banquet. Why do you do what you do? You claim you don't know, but that's a lie, isn't it?"

Leo leaned in closer, blinking slowly.

"A lie you tell others... and yourself. Maybe you didn't know back in that boring world of yours, but here? Here, you damn well know what you want."

Azriel's face softened. He sighed and turned his gaze forward, locking onto the giant gate ahead. It would take days for the dungeon to rebuild the bridge.

Leo clicked his tongue and sat down in one motion.

"Oh?"

Azriel turned to him, annoyed—until his eyes widened.

"Oh."

Leo's hands were flickering, appearing and disappearing constantly. Azriel understood why.

"Looks like your time's finally starting to run out," Azriel observed.

Leo nodded slowly. "It seems so. Soon, the original me will regain everything I've learned, and I'll finally be whole again. I'll finally play this fun game... and I'll be coming for you, remember that."

"Shut up. Stop saying it like you're actually going to do it. You still have time left—save your dramatic lines for then."

Leo laughed again.

"I guess you're right."

A silence fell over them, the peace settling in once more. Azriel closed his eyes, savoring it. It was strange—he didn't feel panicked.

He just felt... hollow.

His hand was gone. He had downed all his health potions to ensure his wounds were closed and the bleeding had stopped for now. If he survived today, he could get his hand fixed. It wasn't impossible in this day and age.

But it wasn't cheap, either.

And who was he? A prince who would be scolded by his sister and mother for not getting his hand reattached.

"Well, this is an interesting sight."

A voice sounded behind Azriel, but he didn't turn. He remained seated, eyes still closed.

Footsteps approached silently.

"Well, would you look at that? Your gamble paid off. Though I thought he'd look scarier," Leo remarked.

Azriel listened as Leo examined the newcomer.

"Handsome face. Nice jawline. Black hair and blue eyes... Damn, I could drown in those eyes."

Azriel's lips curved up slightly before he pressed them together again.

'Idiot.'

Finally, the man arrived and sat down next to Azriel.

"A lot of things haven't made sense since I returned to Earth. The future destroyed. Plans leaked by a sixteen-year-old boy. One of my most useful men turned into a fanatic," the man said calmly.

"...Indeed. Strange," Azriel muttered, glancing at the figure beside him.

'Zoran...'

A walking time bomb. One wrong move, and it would explode, killing him.

"When I entered the void dungeon, I felt its murderous intent. I saw the floor shifts that happened here and on the first floor... A dungeon shift like this only occurs when there are two or more Children of the Gods inside."

"..."

"I know the Child of Life is here, and so is the Child of Dreams. I spotted the Child of War on the surface, making only two in here. Yet the entire dungeon already shifted. That means... either everyone's luck is terrible, or another brother or sister of mine is here."

Zoran turned to Azriel, who did the same, both locking eyes.

"I suppose it's only natural to assume, with all your involvement, that the third child is you, Azriel Crimson."

After a few moments of silence, Azriel's lips curved slightly.

"That is correct."

"A dead man. That's what you were supposed to be. Yet you came back... Now, I know who all my other siblings are, but not you. Still, it's not hard to guess whose child you are. The only one left...

The one who was neutral, uninvolved—blessed none."

Zoran licked his lips.

"The God of Death. Prince Azriel Crimson, son of Death, returned from the grave... You've ruined the future. Destroyed everything I've prepared for the last decade just by being alive."

"That is correct."

"I don't understand why the God of Death chose you, or why it had to be you. But your existence has done irreparable damage."

"That, too, is correct. As expected of you, Zoran, Apostle of Ruin, one of the seven Heptarchs of Neo Genesis."

A smile appeared on Zoran's face at Azriel's words.

"I wonder how much you know. The Supreme Archon only shares part of the books with us Heptarchs. Clearly, he didn't give one to you. So it makes me curious, because I'm sure you knew the future... the one that was supposed to happen."

"The Supreme Archon didn't give me anything, but it doesn't matter. My knowledge of the future is now the same as yours. Basically nothing. I know nothing, just like everyone else in Neo Genesis."

"The Supreme Archon might be angry—or maybe not. I never knew how he thought. But... humor me. Why?"

"Why?"

"Yes. Why? You came back from the dead, and I can understand that, but... why do all of this? What is your end goal?"

Azriel's eyes shifted to Leo, who stood nearby, grinning widely before he turned back to stare into the abyss below.

"I could tell you I don't know," Azriel muttered, "but like someone recently pointed out... maybe I'm lying to myself as well. Maybe I'll say it's to destroy the future and create a better one—but that's just another lie. Perhaps it's because I want to be the hero, but... no, I don't seek that either."

Zoran smile widened.

"Well... we are all liars here."

Azriel allowed a faint smile to creep onto his face.

"But if I'm being honest?" he continued. "I think... I do everything here just to see the end. The end I never got to read. Just like you Heptarchs didn't. No one did.

But I knew where we were heading, and I didn't want that. I wanted to be part of it—to be a real player in reaching a different end. And then see... who would win."

Zoran remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"Yeah... I want to see the end."

"...You're an ambitious person, Prince Azriel. Not many would have made it to the end we were once aiming for, but at least it was guaranteed. Now? You've destroyed our chances—the chances of surviving."

"What does it matter if humans survive, but humanity doesn't?"

Azriel clenched his fist.

"You're all sick in the head, every one of you in Neo Genesis."

"Are we now?"

Zoran's face darkened, the air around them growing heavy.

"At least we, the 'sick,' are doing something. What are the great clans doing to secure a future? The Sovereigns? Nothing. They just hide, rule and conquer, but in truth, none of them care about humanity as well."

"...Four great kings, seven Sovereigns, ten Apostles, and countless other talented people... Yet you Heptarchs decided to follow a cursed book handed down by that Supreme Archon—a book that isn't even half-complete. You barely knew if your plan would work."

"...Do you have a better plan?"

Azriel shook his head.

"No... but I'll find one. One that doesn't require me to give up my humanity."

Chapter 101: We Are All Liars Here [4]

Zoran stared at Azriel, who held his gaze. It felt like an eternity, the silence growing heavier with every second. Azriel could hear his own heartbeat, pounding in his chest, loud enough that he wondered if Zoran could hear it too.

He probably did.

Finally, Zoran let out a tired sigh, turning back toward the massive gate before them.

"You came back from the dead, sabotaged the future we were building, and succeeded. You don't even care about being a hero. All you want is to survive, to see the end. Yet, you're doing it while going against us—without a plan. You've ensured no one else has one either. I wonder...

how far you've read in that book of the future that you have. It must be farther than any of us Heptarchs if you had the nerve to act so boldly."

Azriel swallowed, his throat painfully dry. He tried to speak, but nothing came. He watched Zoran with an unreadable expression.

"Do you realize how annoying you are?" Zoran continued, his voice low, dangerous.

"It's taking everything in me not to tear you in half, just like I did with Void Commander Dante. It's remarkable, really—how a mere kid managed to outplay us, without even having the strength to back it up. You must think I'm a fool if you believe I haven't noticed that you're hiding even more from me."

Azriel's lips curled into a faint smile.

"As you said... we are all liars here."

A pause hung in the air before Zoran's tone darkened.

"…I think I've heard enough. I don't want to know more from someone as vile as you. Goodbye, Prince Azriel. Be proud—you've done more damage to us than anyone has in the last decade."

Zoran stood up, and Azriel's blood turned cold. His fists clenched as dread tightened around him.

He didn't turn or move—there was no point. Zoran wasn't just any saint. He was an Apostle, a Heptarch, powerful enough to make even Grandmasters question themselves.

There was nothing Azriel could do now.

'…I stalled as much as I could, but it wasn't enough.'

All that was left was to wait.

Leo stood beside him, his expression unreadable.

"Out of respect for what you've done, despite your weakness, I'll grant you a painless death, Prince."

Zoran's cold voice pierced Azriel's ears, sending a wave of goosebumps across his skin. He gritted his teeth.

And then—

"Whoa! Am I interrupting something intimate here? Should I leave the two of you alone for some... quality time?"

A new voice echoed through the cave, light and mocking.

Zoran froze.

Azriel exhaled, his body nearly collapsing in relief. Sweat covered him, but none of it mattered.

It was over.

Shakily pushing himself off the ground, Azriel stood, along with Zoran, both turning toward the entrance.

Zoran growled, his expression grim.

"Saint Solomon... the clown. The youngest to ever become a saint."

Solomon's red eyes gleamed as his twisted grin widened.

In one hand, he dragged a limp body—armor-clad, white knight-like.

'…The Guardian.'

Solomon was holding its body.

Ignoring Zoran, Solomon's gaze shifted to Azriel.

"You took too long, so I figured I'd take this little guy for a walk to the twentieth floor. Trust me, no one wants to be there right now. The whole dungeon's gone crazy. Perfect for getting stronger, though. Want to join me after we clean up this mess?"

Azriel blinked as Solomon swung the Guardian's body like a toy. He couldn't help but curse inwardly.

'I almost died because he got bored…?'

Frustration simmered beneath his exhaustion.

The plan had been simple—Solomon was supposed to wait, hide after Instructor Benson's defeat.

But, of course, Solomon had gone off-script.

Azriel had never fully trusted him, which is why he had backups in place.

Still... it pissed him off.

Solomon's eyes flicked to the shattered bridge, then back to Azriel's battered form, noticing his missing hand.

"Well, you handled it on your own. As expected from my future partner! Stealing the mana bomb from the academy vault and planting it here—brilliant move. All's well that ends well, right?"

Sighing, Solomon approached the edge of the broken bridge, his grin widening as he glanced at the Guardian.

"You were a good travel companion. You didn't speak, but your eyes said plenty. Sorry I couldn't return the favor."

With that, Solomon tossed the Guardian's body into the void below.

"...!"

The ground shook.

Azriel collapsed to one knee, unable to stabilize himself.

A pulse surged through the ruins, blue light flickering from the bridge's runes. Azriel turned just in time to see the massive gate glowing before it began to open slowly.

"Well, that's sorted," Solomon said, satisfied.

"It should stay open for the next 24 hours, give or take. Man, who would've thought a hidden boss fight would be here? Epic, right? Too bad the dungeon's a mess—I'd explore more, but even I'm cautious these days."

With his rambling done, Solomon turned to Zoran, their eyes locking.

"So, you're one of the seven Heptarchs. Zoran, was it? Gotta say, I expected you to look scarier. But nope, just another handsome face. Which, let's be honest, isn't special—all saints are good-looking."

Solomon grinned, pointing a finger at Zoran.

"So, in other words… you're plain."

Veins bulged in Zoran's forehead. He was holding himself back from tearing Solomon apart.

Azriel couldn't blame him.

Despite his chaotic nature, Solomon was dangerous.

Perhaps more dangerous than any other saint. And if Zoran had read his part of the book telling him about the future, he would know not to underestimate Solomon.

"…Has the clown become a circus pet?" Zoran asked, voice dripping with contempt.

"I never thought you, of all people, would work for the Crimson Clan."

Azriel remained silent as Solomon blinked, tilting his head in confusion.

"Me? Work for the Crimson Clan? No, no, no, that's impossible. I'd rather eat pickles."

Solomon waved his hand dismissively.

"I don't work for anyone. I cut a deal with that annoyingly handsome prince, and we work together. Partners. No allegiances to clans or any of that nonsense."

Before Zoran could respond, his gaze flickered upward, his brows furrowing.

Azriel's heart raced, feeling as if a blade were pressed against his chest. Solomon, too, looked puzzled by Zoran's reaction.

"…Four apostles on the same floor. It's unnatural. I should finish this before something troublesome arises."

Solomon gave Zoran a look of disbelief.

"I've heard you're some weird fanatic who gave up his humanity for power, but you really are insane, aren't you? Do all Heptarchs follow the mad writings in that book of yours?"

Zoran's expression was unreadable as he remained silent. Solomon sighed.

"Well, no matter. I've learned what I needed. Not that I care, but…"

Grinning wildly, Solomon's voice dripped with mockery.

"How does it feel to get outplayed by a sixteen-year-old? Azriel ruined your precious plans, led you into a trap, and now, you're stuck in a cave with me. No escape. Don't you feel like absolute trash?"

Zoran's eyes turned bloodshot, glaring at Solomon with murderous intent.

Azriel clenched his jaw.

'I need to get out of here.'

Just one wrong move from these two, and he'd be dust.

He limped toward the entrance, his footsteps echoing in the now-silent cave.

Passing Zoran, Azriel didn't glance his way, and neither did Zoran toward him. As Azriel neared Solomon, the saint flashed him a grin.

"You did well. Go get some rest."

"…Yeah, I will."

Azriel forced a strained smile as he passed Solomon, but before he reached the dark passage, Zoran's cold voice echoed behind him.

"You're the Apostle of Death. The Son of Death. The God of Death was never supposed to choose a side, yet he did. He broke the rules. Remember this, Prince Azriel Crimson—no one will ever look upon the Son of Death kindly. You will deceive yourself, seeking a place where you think you belong, but the truth is, you never will.

You seek the end, but you will never reach it."

Azriel stopped, listening to Zoran's words but not turning around.

Eventually, he sighed.

"…How would you know? I destroyed the future. Nothing is written anymore."

"...."

Azriel didn't wait for a response, nor did he get one.

The only sound that followed him was Solomon's mad laughter, echoing through the cave.

He seemed energized, almost drunk on adrenaline, eager for the chaos to begin.

Without looking back, Azriel stepped into the darkness.

His body ached, each limp forward feeling heavier than the last. But he pushed on.

As he hobbled further away from the cave, Leo's voice cut through the silence, sulking.

"We should've stayed, at least for the start! I mean, come on, who'd want to miss a fight between the legendary Son of Ruin and the Clown? Seriously, have you lost it?"

"Shut up."

Azriel snapped, his voice harsh.

"I would've had to use [Redo] just for watching them fight. Neither of us could've kept up anyway."

Leo's complaints weren't baseless. Both Zoran and Solomon were legends, even among saints. And that's precisely why it was too dangerous to stay.

Two crazed lunatics, both hell-bent on killing each other.

Why would he risk his life watching a battle he couldn't even comprehend?

But there was one thing he was certain of: right now, he was safe.

The sounds of the cave had long faded behind him, not even a sign of tremors.

Nothing disturbed the eerie silence. It felt like this dark passage was a separate world entirely, disconnected from the abandoned tunnel on the other side and the cave.

It was confusing.

Yet, somehow, this tunnel wouldn't be destroyed.

It simply couldn't.

Because there was nothing here to destroy.

How could one destroy nothing?

Leo's voice broke through his thoughts again, though now it carried a quieter, almost mocking tone.

"So, you want to see the end, huh? Makes sense. You never got to finish reading, and you're an idiot who loves discovering the unknown… heh. Still, to think each Heptarch has a book with a piece of the future written in it. That idiot thought he knew everything, but honestly, he was following blindly. No clue what he was really doing."

Azriel's lips twitched into a faint smile at Leo's words.

"It's called pure devotion. The book he has shows only fragments of the future, as you said. But he doesn't know the whole story—just what's told to him, and what the other Heptarchs have shared. In the end, only the Supreme Archon knew the final outcome before I came. And yet, these people don't question him. They trust him completely, follow him without hesitation.

If he says black is white, then to them, black will be white for the rest of their lives."

The Crying Fog let out a deranged laugh.

"Truly mad, unlike us. We're the only sane ones here."

Azriel's smile widened as he limped further into the darkness.

"Indeed, we are."

Chapter 102: The Show [1]

"Just what happened...?"

Jasmine stood up, feeling as if the last few minutes had slipped away like a fleeting dream.

Nol did the same, blinking around him in confusion.

For a moment, a surmountable pressure had descended upon them, dragging both of them down.

Then a massive gust of wind swept past, tearing through the air like a missile.

And then...

It stopped.

"...Huh?"

Jasmine exclaimed, her confusion deepening as she turned to see the boss gate open.

Her eyes widened, and she ran through it, Nol shouting behind her to wait, but she didn't listen.

She raced as fast as she could, only to arrive in a room that was entirely empty.

The throne was there as usual, but there was no boss.

The Dark King was gone, defeated once again, yet there was no sign of a struggle.

"...You shouldn't run off like that; the other group will be arriving any second."

Nol's voice echoed behind her, but Jasmine didn't turn around. Instead, she pursed her lips and walked further into the room, standing on the platform.

'...Just who did this so easily?'

Someone had passed by her without notice, taking down the Dark King in mere moments and then traveling to the second floor in the blink of an eye.

Nol quietly watched from behind as she was lost in thought.

Jasmine furrowed her brows and finally turned to him.

"Who—"

Her words were cut off as her eyes widened once again at the sudden sound of footsteps approaching the boss room.

Nol stepped closer to Jasmine and stood beside her, both of them gazing at the entrance.

"Looks like they're finally here."

Jasmine narrowed her eyes, while Nol maintained a calm smile as the group of cadets entered the boss room, looking bewildered.

Many of them were mumbling to one another, cautiously stepping forward as they eyed the open boss gate with unease.

'So all of them entered as one group as well.'

It was obvious they would—most would be smart enough to understand that the void dungeon shouldn't be tackled solo. Plus, it was their first time; it was better to have backup for something like this.

The group halted in their tracks, surprised to see Jasmine and Nol standing in the middle of the platform before the throne.

Before any of the cadets could speak, three instructors from the second group appeared, shocking them even more.

Jasmine narrowed her eyes.

'Instructor Jim, Instructor Hans, and Instructor Clarice.'

She knew their names but, unfortunately, didn't know much else about them.

The instructors frowned as they approached, stopping in front of Jasmine and Nol.

"Cadet Jasmine, what is the meaning of this? There have been barely any prowlers attacking the cadets. Why do I see you with this cadet in the boss room here?"

Instructor Hans scowled, his disapproval palpable, while the other instructors nodded in agreement.

Instead of answering, Nol smiled calmly.

"Unfortunately, we've been sent here to inform you that the void dungeon trip is canceled. It's not just the first floor; all the other floors have experienced a floor shift. Right has become left, and left has become right in here."

The instructors exchanged dark looks.

"What is your name, cadet?"

Hans's tone was cold, clearly displeased with Nol speaking. Nol, however, kept smiling as if nothing was wrong.

"My name is Nol—just Nol."

Hans nodded slowly.

"Then—"

"Ah, this is getting too boring. Let's start the show already."

Hans couldn't finish; Nol interrupted him with an exaggerated sigh, his expression one of utter boredom.

Jasmine and the others stared at him, surprised, as Hans's face flushed with anger, but Nol ignored him, turning to Jasmine.

"You see that blondie over there?"

Nol pointed to Instructor Clarice, and Jasmine nodded, still confused.

"She's one of the members of Neo Genesis, along with the other two in front of us—him, her, oh, and him."

Nol began pointing casually at the members of Neo Genesis, and Jasmine and the others exchanged shocked glances.

"Oh right, these aren't their real faces. Master told me they're using some sort of [unique skill] from someone, so the faces they've stolen belong to the dead."

'What...'

Jasmine felt a chill run down her spine as she looked at the faces Nol pointed to, but before she could process it further, Instructor Clarice lunged at Nol, a sadistic grin on her face.

"Looks like this little dove knows everything! Best to get rid of you fast!"

A dagger gleamed in her hand, aimed directly at Nol. Jasmine blinked in surprise.

'So he wasn't lying...'

Sighing, she prepared to make a move, but before she could act, Clarice suddenly froze, only an arm's length away from Nol.

Shock registered on her face, as well as on the faces of everyone else.

"Eh?" Jasmine gasped, staring at Clarice, who was now immobile.

Thin white threads wrapped tightly around her arms and legs, rendering her unable to move. Even her mouth was covered, muffled sounds escaping her lips.

Everyone's heads snapped to Nol, who stood there with a wide smile, arms spread wide, white threads spilling from his bleeding fingertips.

"You should always check your surroundings first, instructor."

Nol laughed, his eyes narrowing. Jasmine's face paled.

"Wait, Nol!"

It was too late.

Suddenly, Nol clenched his fists, and then—

Instructor Clarice's arms, legs, and head were torn apart by the threads, blood splattering across the floor.

A dead silence enveloped the boss room.

Then—

The cadets erupted into screams and retched in horror.

Jasmine stared, frozen, at the remains of Clarice before turning to Nol, disgust pooling in her stomach as he smiled, licking his lips.

"Let the show begin."

Jasmine lips trembled.

"...We are going to have to talk about this after we're done here."

There was nothing more to say as Jasmine bit her lip and turned her attention to the remaining instructors.

'Why am I always surrounded by crazy people?'

A bitter feeling churned inside her as then flames erupted from her hands.

Instructor Jim and Instructor Hans's faces paled as Jasmine approached them calmly.

They slowly backed away, while the other members pretending to be cadets began attacking Nol.

But they weren't strong enough.

Not to defeat the Crimson Princess.

Definitely not her flames.

Nor to overcome the Crimson Prince's right hand.

And certainly not his threads.

Chapter 103: The Show [2]

"I really don't understand why we're just sitting here, waiting to die."

Celestina and Vergil sat side by side on the cold ground, leaning against the wall as the torch above them flickered, casting shaky shadows.

To her right lay the dark tunnel Zoran had entered earlier. After he disappeared into it, both Celestina and Vergil had chosen to stay put instead of following.

Whoever—or whatever—might come out of there, they would wait.

Celestina wasn't about to leave empty-handed.

"If that man comes back, we might as well kill ourselves now."

Celestina frowned at Vergil's words, turning to him.

"He called you his brother... What did he mean by that? Do you know him?"

Vergil met her gaze, his lips tightening as he lightly knocked the back of his head against the wall.

"I've never met that man before today. I don't know why he called me his little brother. He's a madman. The kind you should avoid at all costs."

'He doesn't want to be here at all.'

Celestina found it odd. From the time she'd known Vergil, he'd never been this cautious. But the moment Zoran came into play, Vergil had wanted to flee—yet he hadn't left her behind. He stayed.

'He wants to run, but something keeps him here, too.'

Celestina smirked.

"It's strange seeing you like this. You can leave if you want, Cadet Vergil, but I'm staying until I see who comes out of that darkness."

Vergil's face soured, like he'd bitten into something foul. Eventually, he let out a long sigh.

"There's no way I'm leaving you here alone. Besides... I want to know who's coming, too."

Celestina allowed a faint smile to touch her lips. His concern was rare—especially considering their rocky start.

She rested her head against the wall, closing her eyes.

'What a strange trip this has been.'

The void dungeon had been nothing but abnormal, and now this.

Recklessness nagged at the back of her mind. They should leave. But something deep inside her recoiled at the thought, a disgust that refused to let her turn away now.

So she didn't.

Time passed in silence. Celestina didn't know how long they sat there, unmoving. No void creatures attacked, nothing happened.

The torch burned steadily, as if it would last forever, and their breaths were the only sounds in the oppressive quiet.

Until...

Both Celestina and Vergil's eyes widened at the sound of footsteps.

They leaped up, instinctively retreating from the entrance, eyes fixed on the darkness ahead.

'Please don't be something worse...'

The footsteps grew louder, echoing in the silence. Cold sweat dripped down Celestina's face as the sound of the steps seemed to drown out even her own heartbeat.

And then, a familiar figure limped out of the shadows.

"Huh...?"

"...."

'Of course...'

How could she have forgotten?

It had all started with him—the reason she had come here in the first place.

She had followed Instructor Benson, who was supposed to bring him back.

But Benson hadn't returned, leading them deeper into the dungeon... and in the chaos, she had completely forgotten about him.

Azriel.

The strange abandoned tunnel, the countless bird-like void creatures, Vergil, the dark passage, and then the mysterious Saint.

But now, her attention was locked on Azriel.

Both she and Vergil paled as they took in his condition.

Blood stained his face and clothes, his body battered, and his clothes torn to shreds.

He limped forward, his eyes dull.

Celestina's gaze scanned his injuries until it landed on his right hand—or where his right hand should have been.

"Ah..."

The sound escaped her lips, her hands trembling as they shot to her mouth in shock.

Azriel stopped in his tracks, his eyes widening as he finally noticed the two of them.

He blinked, parting his cracked lips slightly.

"...Why are you two here?"

He looked confused, his bloodied face expressionless as he struggled to stay upright, his body swaying.

Vergil quickly moved forward, wrapping his arm under Azriel's shoulder to steady him.

"Thanks..." Azriel mumbled, a weak smile breaking through the exhaustion.

"Yeah, no problem."

Vergil carefully guided him back to where they had been sitting and eased him down.

Celestina hurried over, her lips trembling.

"What... what happened?"

She crouched, examining Azriel's wounds. Most had already closed—he had clearly taken a lot of healing potions. Some wounds had even been packed with ice, his ice affinity at work.

Vergil spoke up next to her.

"Instructor Benson entered this place. We followed him, but we lost him and ended up here in front of that dark passage. Before we could do anything, an unknown Saint showed up."

Azriel glanced at them, his voice rasping.

"Instructor Kevin is dead. Killed by Benson and his men. I ran, made it here, and ended up in a dead-end cave. They cornered me. I won, but I lost my hand. As for the Saint...

Instructor Solomon's dealing with him. He showed up after I killed Benson's group."

A bitter laugh escaped his lips, followed by violent coughing.

Celestina processed his words in silence, stunned.

'He defeated them? Alone?'

It sounded impossible, but the state of his body was undeniable proof that he had fought for his life. Her eyes drifted to his missing hand.

"Do you... have your hand with you?"

Azriel nodded slowly.

"It's in my storage ring."

Celestina bit her lip and placed both hands on his chest. Azriel and Vergil exchanged confused glances.

"I can't reattach it. I'm not skilled enough for that. But my light affinity should ease the pain."

A soft white glow emitted from her hands, and Azriel's eyes fluttered closed.

"...It's warm. That feels... good."

'He said he won... Did he really kill them all?'

No one but Azriel had returned. And if Solomon was dealing with the Saint...

'But how did Solomon get past us without being noticed?'

It wasn't impossible—Saints could easily outpace both her and Vergil. But Celestina found it hard to believe Solomon would ignore them entirely.

Vergil, strangely quiet, wore a look of relief on his face. Celestina dismissed her thoughts and focused on healing Azriel.

When she had done all she could, she wiped the sweat from her forehead and sighed. Azriel gazed at her, his expression unreadable, as always.

"Why did Instructor Benson and his men come after you?" she asked.

Azriel smiled faintly, pausing before speaking.

"Because I'm the Apex. Benson and his people belong to an organization called Neo Genesis. Their mission was to kill me. Solomon showed up after Neo Genesis apparently attacked on the surface. The Saint you saw was one of their leaders."

Celestina froze, his words sinking in.

'Neo Genesis... That Saint was one of their leaders? An attack happened on the surface?'

It was happening right under her nose, and she had been completely oblivious.

"I'm sorry you had to go through that..." she whispered.

Azriel chuckled weakly, glancing at Vergil before meeting her eyes again.

"You're too kind. What happened wasn't anyone's fault, except the ones who caused this mess in the first place."

Celestina nodded, Vergil remaining silent beside her.

'Still... How did he survive Benson and all his men on his own?'

It was still something she found hard to believe, even with Azriel's current state.

Instructor Benson was an advanced-ranked human.

And the other men?

She was sure they were no pushovers either.

Celestina glanced at Azriel, a single thought running through her mind.

'...Just how strong are you, really?'

Chapter 104: The Show [3]

Solomon and Zoran circled each other, the former grinning widely while the latter wore a displeased expression.

"You're really not living up to your name, acting so timid around me, oh great Heptarch," Solomon taunted.

Zoran furrowed his brows, tilting his head slightly.

"Timid? Unfortunately, I've already discarded such a useless emotion as fear."

Solomon paused, momentarily confused. Zoran stopped as well.

"You say that, yet you don't dare attack me. Doesn't that make you a scared little boy?"

Zoran's face hardened.

"I've discarded fear, not stupidity. Anyone who knows the name Solomon Dragonheart knows better than to strike first."

Solomon's eyes sharpened, his grin widening.

"Besides, anything that comes out of your mouth is of no real value."

"Well, I do feel honored! How about this? I promise to use only my [unique skill], and you're free to use whatever you like."

A tense silence followed before Zoran's expression darkened.

"...Was that supposed to be a joke?"

Solomon chuckled, shrugging.

"You tell me. Everyone else I've told that joke to is no longer around to share it."

Zoran sighed, glancing around before meeting Solomon's gaze again.

"There are rules in the dungeon. One of them is broken if more than two Apostles are on the same floor, which has already happened with me and the prince here. Another will be shattered if we Saints fight on the lower levels."

Solomon blinked.

"Am I supposed to care about these rules? By Apostles, you mean those supposedly blessed by the gods, right?"

Zoran raised an eyebrow at the sudden shift in conversation but nodded.

"That's correct. There are nine Apostles—well, ten Apostles now—ten children of the gods. I am one, the Child of Ruin, blessed by the God of Ruin. We Apostles are superior to lesser humans: stronger, smarter, more—"

"But not charming or attractive, clearly," Solomon interrupted, his mocking tone cutting through.

"Azriel is one of them, isn't he? The Apostle of Death, if I recall. A god who was supposed to stay neutral but didn't… Makes me wonder why that god broke his vow to bless Azriel."

Zoran shook his head.

"What the gods do is beyond human understanding. All that matters is what we do: survive. Survival is like climbing a mountain, and the Supreme Archon has given me the tools to reach the summit."

Solomon's smile faded, his expression turning bored. Zoran took a step forward, locking eyes with him.

"The higher you climb, the steeper it gets. You can either shed the weight you carry or make sure you've got the right tools to keep climbing—better, stronger, safer."

"...You sure love to talk, don't you? I noticed that when you kept yapping with Azriel."

Zoran tilted his head slightly before his eyes narrowed in realization.

"You were here the whole time, weren't you? Hiding in the darkness, close enough to hear everything, yet unseen."

Solomon's lips curved into a small smile.

"I didn't lie when I said I reached the twentieth floor. It was so chaotic there that I returned to watch Azriel battle that instructor. Maybe I should've given old man Benson a raise—it might've helped him keep his composure."

"...."

"Still, watching Azriel fight wasn't disappointing. He's smart enough to use the quality of his soul weapon to his advantage, and he knows when being a coward is better than being a fool. I see why he wanted me to plant that mana bomb beforehand."

Zoran nodded.

"He's young, but he has potential. A strategic mind. He's my brother, in a way. I expect much from him, even if his existence wasn't meant to be."

After a brief silence, Zoran clapped his hands, a small smile matching Solomon's.

"Indeed, I talk too much. Let's get this over with, shall we? Instead of your offer, I'd like to propose one of my own."

"Oh?"

Solomon's intrigue grew as he nodded.

"Go on."

"It would be a shame if our battle destroyed this entire floor. If that happens, only the gods will know what consequences await humanity. The dungeon might take ages to repair itself. So, instead, let's fight in the way we Saints are best known for."
