“Seems so. It’s not here.”
“It seemed to like you a lot.”
“Weren’t you scared?”
“I’m scared. It’s a beast. A wild beast.”
“It looked like a cub, though.”
“You know the hunter, Enri, who scouts with us? He mentioned going out with you.”
Big Eyes asked suddenly. Enkrid nodded, thinking how well-connected Big Eyes was. How did he know Enri?
“He’s from the plains, right?”
Enkrid knew that well. He had learned a lot from Enri himself.
“Enri said there are many wild beasts on the Green Pearl Plains, and the most formidable among them is the Black Panther with Blue Eyes, called the Cheonganpyo. They also call it the Lake Panther.”
Big Eyes was excited, clearly intrigued by the story.
“They say its eyes look like lakes, hence the name Lake Panther. While they hunt gazelles and gnus, they usually draw energy from the earth. They’re considered spirit animals. One of their claws is worth over 10,000 Krona.”
Krona was the currency created by the Empire. One bronze coin was worth 1 Krona.
A hundred bronze coins equaled one silver coin, and a hundred silver coins equaled one gold coin.
So, 10,000 Krona equaled one gold coin.
One claw worth a gold coin. That was more than Enkrid’s pay.
“Do you think you could pull out a claw that could slit a man’s throat?”
“...I’m not greedy.”
Big Eyes waved his hand dismissively. As Enkrid moved around a bit, he started to sweat and felt a dull pain. Still, it was manageable. Having faced death so often, gauging his wounds by the pain was second nature to him.
“If you push yourself, it’ll get worse.”
Jaxon, who had been watching, spoke. Only Big Eyes and Jaxon were still there, the others having gone out.
“I’m pacing myself.”
As he answered, moving around, he recalled how he had deflected the Mustached Man’s strike. How had he done it?
Could he do it again if asked?
He wasn’t sure. Maybe not?
Then again, with a few more tries, he thought he could. As he pondered, Rem and Ragna returned.
“Walk further apart. Laziness is contagious.”
Rem teased.
“Why do you always seem eager to die?”
Ragna countered twice as hard. Before the argument could escalate, Enkrid spoke up.
“I have a question. About swordsmanship.”
Both looked at him.
“Go ahead.”
“If it’s about swordsmanship, I should answer.”
They started glaring at each other again, so Enkrid quickly continued. It wasn’t complicated. He had seen an enemy do something several times, and it had become ingrained in his body and emerged unconsciously. That was the gist of it. He explained his experience as plainly as possible.
“Well, that kind of thing happens with practice.”
Rem answered first.
“Interesting experience. I’ve always thought I was special since childhood, but in your case, it’s divine blessing. The Goddess of Fortune must have tripped and dropped a gold coin.”
Ragna followed. Neither comment was particularly helpful. They started bickering over Enkrid again, but then more detailed explanations emerged.
“When you fight enough, there are moments when your vision clears. Usually, that happens after countless real battles. If you’ve achieved a point of focus, the chances are higher.”
“Since you’ve somewhat adapted to the Beast’s Heart, you have the ability to watch your opponent’s moves without flinching. If you had a chance to closely observe your opponent’s sword techniques and the distribution of force, your body could respond instinctively. But that only happens if you’ve mastered the basics.”
“The basics are important, but you also need hundreds of rough real battles.”
Listening to them, Enkrid reached a conclusion.
‘Ah.’
What was just a single day for others. For Enkrid, it had been hundreds of fiercely contested days. Not days spent giving up.
Every moment, he had struggled and given his all. The countless hours he had endured and enjoyed had brought him fortune.
In reality, it wasn’t just luck. It was only natural.
The result of studying and persevering through being cut, stabbed, scratched, and killed. Underlying it all was the Beast’s Heart, which granted him courage, and the point of focus.
‘Grateful again.’
It was thanks to these two things. Moreover, Ragna had completely overhauled his basic swordsmanship. The battle with Mitch Hurrier, the pursuit by the mustached man, the day on the battlefield.
Complex thoughts filled his head, sparking a single desire. He wanted to hold a sword again. To swing it. To see how well the last deflection technique had been internalized.
“I want to spar.”
Enkrid mumbled, and both Rem and Ragna shook their heads. Rem added a comment.
“I’ve been called crazy and abnormal since I was a kid, but I think the Squad Leader is crazier than me.”
Of all people, hearing this from Rem was the last thing he wanted. Rem, who constantly harassed nearby soldiers. Rem, who once tried to decapitate a superior. To be called crazier than this lunatic, it was even more insane.
“Today, I must agree. What kind of sparring can be done in that condition?”
Was wanting to spar such a crime?
Enkrid felt deeply wronged.
“Sparring in that condition is impossible, Squad Leader.”
Rustle.
The tent flap opened, and a voice was heard. Looking up, it was the elf company commander.
When Enkrid tried to stand, she approached.
“Was it you?”
Before he could salute, she asked directly. Enkrid, looking at the sharp, cold beauty of the elf that resembled a sculpture made by an artist, wetted his dry lips before speaking. He had expected her to ask instead of Rem.
How did you break the sorcery?
That was a question from the command.
Chapter 47: Squire
After the battle, the elf company commander realized the sorcery’s medium had been the flag.
So, who had destroyed the flag?
Tracking back through the battlefield's events, she found her answer.
‘The troublemaker squad leader.’
That was why she was here. The Battalion Commander hadn't bothered to investigate who had destroyed the medium. He assumed the incompetent sorcerer had simply failed.
To be fair, many of the continent's sorcerers were charlatans, making that assumption plausible. Besides, the Battalion Commander had bigger concerns. Someone far superior to his immediate superior had visited the unit.
"What do you mean?"
The question about whether it was him received an answer.
"Sorcery, flag, medium."
In just three words, she conveyed everything she wanted to say. Enkrid, having no intention of denying what he had done unless directly asked, responded.
"Yes, I did it."
"How?"
A short question came back.
"I threw a spear like this."
"There were five decoys."
There were a total of six flagpoles, only one of which was real.
"I guessed."
"And you knew the flagpole was the medium?"
"I saw something during a recon mission, and I had some prior knowledge about sorcery."
His answers were smooth. The elf's sharp intuition told her he wasn’t lying. However, anyone could tell he wasn’t being entirely forthcoming. It felt like he was hiding something, even though he had done it. The elf company commander looked into Enkrid's blue eyes and nodded.
"Understood."
"Is that what you came to ask?"
"Yes, and to see your face."
Then she paused, taking a moment before she spoke again.
"It seems we are destined."
Leaving that cryptic remark, she turned and left. It was a statement open to much misunderstanding. Rem poked Enkrid in the side, startled by her words.
"What's your secret?"
"What?"
"The secret to charming an elf. Tell me. I’m all ears."
"Impressive."
Ragna chimed in.
"It's not like that."
Enkrid’s good looks, which even Big Eyes admitted, sometimes attracted women in the city without any effort. Naturally, he wasn’t a virgin. He wasn’t naïve or oblivious enough to mistake signals between men and women.
So, the recent conversation was definitely not about that. There had been no such signals. Instead, he was left with an unsettling feeling. Moreover, she was his superior’s superior.
“When would you have had the time to meet her... Ah, I get it. Was it then? When you were in the medical tent? That’s the only time!”
“No, you crazy bastard.”
Rem continued babbling about the same topic for the next four hours. Ragna left to take a nap midway. Jaxon, who came in later, nodded meaninglessly, lifting Enkrid’s spirits a bit. When Big Eyes arrived later, he started talking but soon leaned in to whisper after hearing what Rem had said.
“Stop rolling around the battlefield. Let’s run a noblewoman's salon together.”
“No, you crazy bastard.”
Big Eyes’ dream was to save up a bunch of Krona and open his own shop. A noblewoman’s salon, where delicate men entertain noblewomen, was his dream establishment.
He planned to sell drinks and snacks, expecting people to come for the clear purpose, even if he charged several times the price. He had made the same proposal to Rem once, nearly getting beaten up, and hadn't brought it up again for a while.
“Don’t talk to me about it. I’ll split your head with an axe.”
Rem smiled wickedly from behind.
“I’m not doing it.”
Big Eyes muttered as if he were dying.
“You’re only pretending to be a barbarian now.”
Big Eyes grumbled quietly, lacking the courage to speak up. Actually, he was already brave. There was no way Rem hadn’t heard his muttering. As Rem began to glare, Big Eyes clapped his hands together.
“Oh, right! I almost forgot what I came here to say, distracted by the Squad Leader’s story.”
Almost forgot?
Rem was just about to retort when Big Eyes hastily spoke. Enkrid let himself be fooled, knowing any story other than the Commander’s supposed love interest was more valuable at this point.
“They’re coming.”
“Who?”
“No, they’re here.”
Big Eyes whispered. His expression was so serious that Enkrid leaned in.
“A knight's squire.”
“...The Red Cloak Knights?”
Enkrid asked.
“Yes.”
Currently, Enkrid and his comrades served in a division called Cyprus. This was also the name of a knight within the Red Cloak Knights.
Typically, an army division would be named after a knight who belonged to the knightly order. Of course, not many were worthy of being called knights. Knights were rare talents even on the continent.
Thus, a kingdom’s knightly order didn’t consist only of knights. Those with the potential to become knights, squires, or apprentice knights who followed and learned from knights. When their apprenticeship ended and they were acknowledged by a knight, they would become proto-knights. Thus, they would serve in the knightly order.
Usually, squires didn’t participate in battles independently. For such a one to be here now meant...
‘He’s soon to be a proto-knight.’
What is a knight?
A troubadour once said:
“To consider knights as ordinary people is a grave mistake. Yes, that’s right. They are beings who surpass human limits. How else would they face beings like the Frogs?”
Knights are said to transcend human limitations.
So, what is a proto-knight?
They are those who are not yet knights but have the potential to become knights. Proto-knights are experts in combat and fighting. If knights overcome human limits, proto-knights reach the peak of human capability.
A squire about to become a proto-knight.
Enkrid wanted to see them. He was curious about their skills. The knights he aspired to be weren’t merely figures of honor. In this era, knights symbolized military might. A part of that symbol had come here.
“You look like you’re dying to see them.”
Rem said, looking at Enkrid.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“They say he’s already prepared to advance.”
Big Eyes mentioned.
“Did he come alone?”
Rem asked, crossing his arms. Big Eyes nodded.
“Yes, he said he’s enough on his own.”
From that, Enkrid understood why the army hadn’t retreated.
‘If Azpen had prepared sorcery.’
Then they had prepared military might as a trump card. Both Naurillia and Azpen. They added an element of surprise to the otherwise tedious annual skirmishes.
‘Do they intend to seize part of the plains with this?’
Had the sorcery worked properly, a proto-knight would have been useless. But now, the situation was different. The sorcery was thwarted, and the army had seized victory. Had the squire arrived a day or two earlier, they would have launched an immediate offensive.
‘They were a bit late.’
By now, the enemy had regrouped.
“Prepare to march! The entire army moves now!”
Enkrid stopped his train of thought at the shout from outside. It was the platoon leader’s voice.
Suddenly, the platoon leader stuck his head into the tent.
“Hey, did you hear? Of course, you did.”
The platoon leader asked and then answered himself.
“Everyone’s marching out. We’re pushing our front lines further into the Green Pearl Plains.”
“Is it okay to announce the plan so openly?”
Enkrid asked, looking at the platoon leader.
“There’s nothing to hide. We’re moving out immediately. Are you coming?”
“I’d like to watch.”
Enkrid stood, his injured body protesting. Ideally, he should stay out of the battlefield, but...
“I’ll stay by your side.”
Big Eyes raised his hand. He was always careful about his own safety. It would be safe for Enkrid to stay near him.
The platoon leader didn’t care for Enkrid like family. He was much older and could be overbearing at times. Moreover, as the leader of a troublesome squad, there were frequent clashes.
Still, seeing Enkrid dead would weigh on his conscience. He practiced tirelessly, never letting a moment pass idly, often drawing the ire of others. Seeing such a diligent person become a corpse wasn’t pleasant.
“Take care of yourself.”
The platoon leader said and left.
“If you want to watch, then watch.”
Rem nodded. Ragna began preparing for deployment. Jaxon strapped on his sword and grabbed a few throwing knives. Equipment he usually didn’t bother with.
“I’ll stay beside you.”
Jaxon said.
“Beside me?”
Rem joked. Jaxon shook his head.
“You smell so bad it’s hard to even share a tent with you.”
Rem was good at subtly provoking people, but Jaxon excelled at outright antagonizing them.
“Squad Leader, I think I want to split that guy’s head before the Azpens. What do you think?”
“Hold back. Let’s just watch. Aren’t you curious to see how well the squire fights?”
“He’ll probably fight extremely well.”
Rem replied, grabbing his axe. As Enkrid limped out to join the formation, Vengeance approached.
“Are you out of your mind?”
After the battle, Enkrid had thanked him, and Vengeance had grumbled but came to the tent. He said he had repaid his debt and was relieved, happily ranting alone. When Enkrid asked what debt he meant.
“Remember the fire in the medical tent?”
“There’s no way I’d forget that. How could I?”
He had forgotten. Repeating today so often had its drawbacks. Still, it wasn’t something he could entirely forget.
The fire, the assassin, and the blaze.
Enkrid had started the fire. Vengeance thought he had saved him from the fire, but he had actually saved him from the assassin.
‘Saving is saving.’
A debt was a debt. Since the other believed it that way, it was easier to accept. That’s why he had rushed over to save him in the battlefield. Looking at Vengeance glaring at him in the field, Enkrid spoke.
“Who wants to die?”
“Then why are you out here?”
“I want to watch.”
“What?”
“They say a squire is here.”
“Oh, hey, don’t get too ahead of yourself. I’m not saving you a second time.”
Vengeance said and returned to his formation.
“Why’s he acting all buddy-buddy? Wasn’t he always picking fights before?”
Rem asked from the side.
He had been. Vengeance had disliked Enkrid. When had that changed?
“Don’t call him ‘that guy.’ He’s a platoon leader. The more time I spend with him, the more I see he’s a decent person.”
“Don’t get too soft. If you cry about getting stabbed in the back later, it’ll be too late.”
“Mind your own business.”
The formation and movement were quickly completed. The ranks weren’t perfectly aligned, and the formation spread out in a wide arc as they began to march.
Someone stood alone at the front. A red cloak fluttered in the wind. The figure at the front, cloaked, walked calmly. From the outside, there was no hint of the squire’s or proto-knight’s prowess.
“Hmph, judging by his stride, he can fight.”
Rem commented, frowning with his arms crossed.
“It’s more than that. His stance is solid. Unless there’s someone like a Frog on the enemy side, it’ll be a boring fight.”
Ragna added. Jaxon also looked ahead. His eyes seemed to scan the figure in the red cloak. Big Eyes, next to Enkrid, brought up another point.
“It’s time to fall back now. We’ll get swept up if we don’t.”
Big Eyes was calculating when they should retreat. And at that moment, the red cloak flared. The cloak fluttered in the wind as its owner dashed forward.
Enkrid blinked, needing to confirm what he was seeing. Behind the running figure, an afterimage remained.
How fast must someone be to leave an afterimage?
“Seems he’s putting his will into his legs.”
Ragna muttered, watching. Enkrid didn’t fully understand but didn’t want to ask now.
It was time to focus.
Seeing the cloaked figure running, the enemy fired arrows. Apparently, they hadn’t deployed crossbowmen separately this time, as a cluster of arrows flew overhead. At least a hundred archers seemed to have fired their arrows. The squire didn’t swing his sword, instead he accelerated.
Bang!
The ground and dirt exploded like a fountain, and the cloaked figure had already closed in on the enemy.
He had outrun the arrow’s range just by running. It was clearly a move beyond human limits.
Chapter 48: If the End is in Sight, You Can Crawl Over It
It was the first time such a level of force had been deployed in a small-scale skirmish. Just as the enemy had prepared sorcery, this side had prepared the squire. The impact of the squire on the battlefield was catastrophic.
Dodging the rain of arrows by advancing, the proto-knight drew his sword and slashed.
Swish.
In an instant, a silver line was drawn in the air, and the heads of three soldiers standing in the front rolled off. The squire retracted his sword and struck downwards. The sword fell like a black lightning bolt and then immediately rose upward.
The head of a soldier holding a pike was caught in its trajectory.
Crack!
It didn’t just cut, it shattered. The impact of the sword blow crushed the soldier’s head, and then the sword flew like a butterfly. The fluttering of the butterfly’s wings quickly turned into a dirge filled with fear. The sword strikes, piercing through gaps, took the lives of enemy soldiers.
Then two soldiers with thick wooden shields blocked his path. Blocking him with their entire bodies, the butterfly’s wings were halted by the shields. As the sword struck the shields, deep dents appeared on their surfaces.
“Surround him!”
An enemy soldier shouted, sweating profusely as he did his best, but even giving his all didn’t free him from the grim reaper’s grasp. The owner of the red cloak gripped his sword with both hands and swung horizontally.
Bang! Crash!
The sword struck the shield. The iron-bound part wasn’t cut but bent, fulfilling its role as a shield, but the hands holding it couldn’t withstand the impact.
“Ahhh!”
The soldier's wrist twisted and broke, with bones piercing through the skin. As the shield fell helplessly to the ground, the sword slashed horizontally across the soldier’s torso. His upper body was severed, and his entrails fell to the ground with a splat. Blood splattered everywhere.
Fear spread through the surrounding soldiers' eyes.
“Shit.”
One of the soldiers from Azpen cursed tearfully. The cloaked figure seemed to twitch his nose at this and then immediately kicked off the ground. His sword was terrifying, but the most frightening aspect was his footwork.
One moment he was here, and the next he was over there, severing throats and piercing bodies. Blocking with shields or armor was meaningless.
“Shoot him!”
One of the commanders shouted. It was a bold decision. Thirty crossbowmen who had been waiting fired their bolts.
He couldn’t dodge all the close-range shots. The commander was sure of it. The owner of the cloak shattered that certainty.
Bang!
Before the bolts could reach him, he kicked off the ground and soared into the sky. The quarrels cut through empty air. What goes up must come down. The cloaked figure, drawing an arc in the air, landed ten steps ahead of the Azpen's commander.
He was in the heart of the enemy camp.
“...Block him!”
The highest commander of Azpen's shout was pitiful.
If the Gray Hounds were still around, things might have been different. They had already retreated, burdened with the responsibility of the defeat and Mitch Hurrier’s injuries.
“Hoo.”
The owner of the cloak took a deep breath and swung his sword again. From top to bottom, and then from bottom to top.
Swish!
The blade, curving like a whip, slashed through the commander’s guards.
Wham! Crack!
The thick leather armor worn by the guards was cut clean through. The guard, wearing an iron helmet, was hit on the head by the sword's flat side and was flung away.
Boom!
Hit once and rolled to the side, blood poured from the guard’s nose. Though he seemed fine on the outside, the inside of his skull had been shattered by the impact. Having dealt with the guards, the squire pierced the commander’s neck.
Thud.
The squire, having killed the enemy commander in the middle of their camp, turned to retreat. Even his retreat was remarkable. He kicked an enemy soldier away and then sprinted across the ground in a series of powerful leaps.
From a distance, it looked like a red line was being drawn across the battlefield. Enkrid and his comrades watched the fight from start to finish. Rem thought the squire was quite skilled.
‘He knows how to play.’
He was a man who knew how to stir up the heart of the enemy camp. By showing his overwhelming power without holding back, he instilled fear. Through that, he ravaged the enemy camp at will.
The most impressive part was how he evaded the crossbowmen's ambush.
‘If it were me, I’d charge straight into the crossbowmen first.’
The squire clearly had proper training. It was no wonder they were called experts in battle and war. Instead of dealing with the crossbowmen first, he left them. When they targeted him, he used his reserved leg strength, leaping over the ground and flying at the enemy commander.
He was like a flying tiger. It felt like watching a winged tiger.
Ragna assessed his level and compared it to himself. He was an opponent who had walked the path he needed to follow.
‘At that level.’
He would reach it soon enough. Even without shortcuts or grueling training. While Rem had analyzed the enemy’s strategy, Ragna had evaluated the enemy's abilities.
‘His swordsmanship is sharp.’
It was a mix of swift sword techniques and heavy sword techniques. At first glance, it looked like he was using straight sword techniques, but it was all an illusion. It was clear he had an excellent sword instructor.
Typically, mixing two sword styles would make the basics sloppy. But the squire in the red cloak showed no such sloppiness.
‘Well, he is a squire.’
Having gauged his level, Ragna felt his motivation wane. Seeing someone ahead on the path didn't ignite his competitive spirit. It just left him with the task of walking that path.
Only training remained, and it was tedious and grueling. Because his talent was so exceptional, it was a problem.
Jaxon gauged the opponent's skill and found gaps.
‘At least five times.’
The enemy could have killed the cloaked figure. It was a matter of strategy, not ability. The commander had been stupid. And the unexpected strike had left them flustered.
If it had been Jaxon, he would have ended it before it reached such a situation. The religious squad member watched the opponent's movements and nodded.
“He is a brother skilled in guiding souls to the side of the Lord.”
It was a way of saying he fought well.
“We don’t need to fall back.”
Big Eyes was astounded. Just one person was controlling the flow of the battlefield. Victory seemed assured before the fight had even begun.
And Enkrid was...
‘This is a knight.’
He was overwhelmed. His heart pounded wildly, and his whole body trembled. His skin prickled, and he felt a chill. At the same time, he felt a warm heat rising from his lower abdomen.
His eyes were glued to the squire. In the current continent, squires, and proto-knights were the main force of the knight orders. They were one step away from becoming knights who could change the tide of war single-handedly.
The killing machine was now altering the tide of battle. He had killed the enemy commander and calmly returned.
‘How can he do that?’
The cloaked figure wasn’t a beastman or a Frog. Yet he displayed such power. A symbol of power capable of cutting down hundreds alone, that was a knight.
What made that possible?
What had brought him to the limits of human capability?
Enkrid didn’t know. Not knowing made him even more impressed by the figure’s movements. At the same time, he felt something burst in his mind.
“Sometimes you can learn just by watching.”
The words of a sword instructor in a big city flashed through his mind. His excitement subsided, and unbidden, his focused concentration activated. With this superhuman focus, he could understand the meaning behind the opponent's steps. He saw the intention in the sword swings.
‘Heavy sword technique.’
The power of the heavy sword. Being able to swing the sword meant being able to swing it quickly as well. The opponent mixed the essence of the heavy sword with the swift sword technique. Enkrid could see that.
‘He stepped back.’
It looked like a movement to set the range of his attack line.
‘No. He’s not setting it. He already set it.’
The northern heavy sword technique taught by Ragna built its basics around the attack line. The squire’s method was slightly different. He drew a circle with himself at the center.
It was based on the central continent's fundamental technique. He drew a circle with his body as the center and slaughtered anyone within that circle. If they approached, he cut them; if they came closer, he pierced them. It looked like he was using footwork to overwhelm the opponent, but in reality, it was different.
‘He maintained his range.’
He only used his feet when necessary. While a few sword strikes were impressive, most of the attacks were thrusts. He watched and watched again. He gathered the information entering his eyes and organized it in his mind.
‘Does a heavy sword technique always have to involve a downward strike?’
Mitch Hurrier’s ultimate move was similar to a heavy sword technique rather than a straight or flowing sword technique. The wheel slice that cut through anything.
Why did he use it as a trump card?
To deceive the opponent?
No. Just because sword techniques were divided into five categories didn’t mean they were entirely different styles. There was overlap between the five sword techniques. Using the heavy sword technique didn’t necessarily mean downward strikes and brute force were the only correct methods.
His eyes rolled. His brain whirred. Enkrid’s fingers twitched involuntarily.
“Enjoying the view? Hmm?”
Rem tried to strike up a conversation, then stopped. Ragna, no longer interested in the squire’s movements, turned around at the sound.
“Don’t touch him.”
Ragna whispered. He recognized the state of the squad leader at a glance. Whether on the battlefield, in a tavern, or in an alley, or in the arms of a lover. Realization came like a trick played by the goddess of fortune.
Suddenly, abruptly, unexpectedly, silently arriving, shaking one’s brain out of the blue.
“Stand guard.”
Jaxon stepped forward and spoke. Ragna stood on the right, Rem on the left. The religious squad member silently moved to stand behind Enkrid. Big Eyes whispered, asking what was happening. Rem answered the whisper.
“The Squad Leader is about to break out of his shell. It was about time. He’s been swinging his sword day and night alone.”
Rem acknowledged the squad leader's effort. He deserved this fortune. Of course, this was no mere fortune. It was a natural process that had come through countless battles and rebuilding the basics of swordsmanship.
Ragna, seeing Enkrid’s current state, felt a surge of motivation.
‘How can this be?’
What makes the squad leader like this?
Knowing the end, knowing his limits, why does he not let go of the sword?
To Ragna, it was a mysterious thing. As always, he was more fascinated by the squad leader compared to the squire rampaging in the enemy camp. After the knight order’s member returned, the ally commander’s shout echoed in the air.
“Chargeee!”
The allies soon rushed forward. Amidst the mingling shouts and cries, as the infantry charged, the ground rumbled. Enkrid continued to stare blankly into the air. He was still in a state of realization. Thanks to their previous battle’s exploits, the troublemaking squad could take a spectator's stance. No one could scold them for standing still.
Even if they wanted to, the murderous aura exuded by the four excluding Big Eyes was too intimidating to approach. Despite seeing the squire rampaging ahead, the allies found the troublemaking squad more chilling up close.
Thus, leaving them alone, the war raced toward its end. The following winter and spring would likely be very busy. They would have to spend the winter with the resources they had stored and rebuild their base.
The boundary between Naurillia and Azpen would be redrawn.
While the allies charged, Enkrid was reviewing the basics he had learned. The intersection, the swordsmanship, the Vallen-style mercenary sword, the northern heavy sword.
Everything was a weapon he had learned. There was no need to confine these weapons to the frame of basics. A heavy sword could also deflect and flow.
Binding, the technique of connecting swords, was the basis of deflecting. When he learned, he hadn’t even noticed.
In a state of realization, the unexpected enlightenment didn’t instantly elevate Enkrid's skills. No, it improved his insight to some extent, but his talent was too meager to instantly incorporate it into his body.
However, Enkrid clearly understood his limits. That meant he could train up to his limit and surpass it given time. He could now see the top of the cliff that once seemed endlessly high and invisible. He could see the end of the wall that once seemed too high and wide to scale.
When the end is in sight, no matter how far, high, or wide, even if you can’t walk, you can crawl over it. Enkrid realized this.
“Ah.”
He felt so joyous he could drool. In fact, he was drooling as he awakened from his state of realization.
“Why are you drooling?”
Rem teased him from the side. Enkrid opened his eyes and looked around. There were no allies in sight anymore.
“They all charged. If you’re tired, you should rest in the tent, not sleep standing.”
“Ah.”
“What do you mean, ah? Let’s go back. There’s no more fighting to be done.”
It was true. The squire with the cloak had returned to the main camp. The battle was over. The enemy was retreating beyond their homeland. It was time to return. Time to go back to the city. Enkrid turned his body, looking at the setting sun.
Having seen the squire’s power, his passion reignited. With his destination and ideal place in sight. Once again, his old dream surfaced.
‘How do I become a knight?’
It wasn’t just about increasing his power. First, he needed to prove his skill. His time as a bottom-rank soldier was over.
Enkrid muttered to himself.
Chapter 49: Madness, Passion, Ambition, and Desire
"We won."
"We fucking won!"
"Screw you, Azpen bastards!"
Victory brought cheers. Cheers brought heat. Heat brought madness. The intense energy intertwined, sweeping over the entire battlefield.
What is the greatest achievement of a battle?
It's when you chase down fleeing enemies. Naurillia bit down hard on Azpen's tail.
"Uwooo!"
Before honoring the dead, the joy of victory swept through the allies first. It was only natural for some madness to appear. Just a few days ago, they were on the brink of annihilation. The terror of death brought by the fog was still deeply etched in their hearts.
Now, after having achieved an overwhelming victory in the face of such fear;
"Long live the Red Cloak Knights!"
"Long live Naurillia!"
The squire did not reveal his name. Instead, the name of the knightly order soared high.
"Long live the Red Cloak Knights!"
Those cheers, that heat, that madness. At the forefront of the battlefield, receiving all the applause, stood the figure at the center of it all. With a flourish, the squire's symbolic red cloak billowed as he raised a hand in response to the cheers.
"Uwooo!"
Some soldiers, drunk on victory, shed tears of joy. Everyone shouted in celebration, intoxicated by the frenzy. Enkrid quietly murmured to himself:
"Me too."
No one heard his words, but they contained his long-held dream. The madness and heat spread, making Enkrid's heart race. The end of the battle, the last night on the battlefield. Despite the considerable number of casualties, Enkrid felt exhilarated. He recalled the words of a sword instructor from the big city, who had three missing fingers:
"A guy with no talent who eats sword fodder? He's one of two kinds. Either he enjoys the battlefield or he enjoys killing. Ah, maybe there's a third kind. The ones who live without thinking."
‘I think I'm the kind that enjoys the battlefield.’
He envied the cheers. He had the ambition to stand at the forefront. More than just wielding a sword, he wanted to tear through the battlefield. He didn't hone his martial arts solely because he was intoxicated by the sword.
Enkrid thought about what he did in this battle. He had struggled to survive, that was all. In the end, he did earn some credit by tearing down the flag and breaking the sorcery's medium.
‘But that was also a struggle to survive.’
The sudden surge of exhilaration masked Enkrid's dream and called forth the ambition and desire he had forgotten due to his lack of talent.
‘A knight.’
He would become one. He was determined. This was a moment of reaffirmation.
"It's fucking noisy."
Rem, wandering the battlefield aimlessly, said as he picked his ear. He didn't seem to enjoy the battlefield or killing. There was no sign of exhilaration.
Next to him, Ragna yawned.
"Isn't it over now? Can't we retreat tonight?"
As if that would happen tonight. This guy must be one of those who live without thinking. Jaxon was already cleaning his blade with leather. He was maintaining his sword. He didn't say it or show it, but Jaxon was probably one of those who enjoyed something too.
Who knows? He was always good at hiding himself.
"Wow, the battle ended just like that. Think this would sell if I turned it into a story or a song?"
"Do you even know how to make songs, brother?"
"No. I'd get another bard to do it."
"If you make a song about something you didn't witness yourself, that's fraud."
"Fraud? That's a big accusation. It's not like that, Audin."
Big Eyes and the devout squad member, who could even sell the battlefield, had an incomprehensible conversation. On the day Enkrid tore the sorcery's medium, it was said the devout squad member was soaked in blood as if he had bathed in it.
It meant he had fought ferociously. He seemed calm and quiet, but he possessed overwhelming power.
The reason he stood on the battlefield was unknown. Thoughts led to more thoughts, and Enkrid placed his squad members in his own position.
‘If it were Rem.’
He wouldn't have just pierced and torn the flag. Even if it were Ragna, Jaxon, or the devout squad member. They all would have fought better than him.
‘Next time, more.’
As the exhilaration of the battlefield squeezed his heart, the reaction made desire blossom in Enkrid's chest. The night after the battle, the command distributed food and drink. They served salted rabbit meat, venison, and strong liquor in large oak barrels.
"Liquor, liquor!"
Rem and Ragna went crazy over liquor.
"I only drink wine."
The devout squad member, Audin, refused the strong drink, and Jaxon didn't touch alcohol at all.
"I prefer women over alcohol."
He said it without hesitation. Despite such a statement, why did women flock to him?
‘It must be his face.’
Even Enkrid attracted women effortlessly. It was thanks to his face. His well-toned, muscular body was also a lethal weapon to women.
"This is cheap booze. I won't drink it."
Big Eyes had a refined palate. As the night deepened, the battalion commander entered the tent.
"444 squad leader?"
Enkrid stood up at the sound of someone calling for him. By now, the heat had cooled, and everyone was preparing to sleep. Due to his injuries, Enkrid hadn't touched a drop of alcohol. As a result, he didn't fail to recognize the battalion commander's face.
"An injured man drinking? An injured guy drinking? Drinking when you're injured?"
Rem chided him.
"You should refrain. Focus on recovering first."
Jaxon also dissuaded him. Ragna shook his head silently. Big Eyes chuckled as he watched Enkrid. They were truly crazy squad members. When Enkrid stepped outside at the battalion commander's call, the commander, smelling of alcohol, waved off the salute.
"The flag was the medium for the sorcery? And you tore it?"
It sounded like he had found the one who contributed decisively to the battle by breaking the sorcery.
Crackle, crackle.
Embers from the bonfire floated in the air.
"Yes."
Enkrid answered calmly.
"There will be a reward when we return. Well done."
The battalion commander patted Enkrid's shoulder. It was quite an acknowledgment. It was the first time Enkrid had exchanged words with the battalion commander since becoming a squad leader. It showed how significant Enkrid's actions had been.
He had changed the tide of battle. However, only a few people knew this. Specifically, only the command knew.
In all likelihood, the command would take the credit for overcoming the sorcery in this battle. He didn't mind. Instead, the reward would be substantial.
‘I'm not disappointed.’
Normally, he would think he deserved the credit for what he did.
‘It was a struggle.’
Seeing the knight, or rather just the squire, had changed his perspective. He felt he had gained more than this small achievement.
"You look good."
After the battalion commander left, Enkrid was about to enter the tent again when he heard soft footsteps on the ground.
"Who is it?"
He turned towards the source of the sound and saw eyes like emeralds. In the dark of night, they looked eerie, like a ghost's.
Inhuman beauty.
It was the elven company commander.
"You'll receive a proper reward for tearing the flag."
That seemed to be all she had to say, as she turned to leave. Just as she was about to go, she turned her head and spoke again.
"Aren't you going to salute?"
Enkrid belatedly mimed holding a weapon with his left hand, and the elven commander waved her hand dismissively.
"Never mind. I'm off."
What kind of elf was she?
As the company commander left and he re-entered the tent, he found Rem lying down with his arm under his head.
"Don't leave me just because you're getting popular, Squad Leader."
"Are you drunk?"
"I'm not drunk."
It was a joke. Night had deepened. Enkrid closed his eyes and recalled what he had seen and felt from the squire.
There was much to do once his body healed.
After waking up, the Naurillia infantry battalion headed for Border Guard. After a four-day march, they faced the city walls of the fortress city, Border Guard.
It was a city with long walls and three large watchtowers built high on a plateau higher than other areas. This was the last bastion against Azpen.
The fortress city, Border Guard.
The appearance of the squire from the Red Cloak Knights could change the tide of the battlefield. Until now, the skirmishes on the Green Pearl Plains had remained small-scale because of an unspoken rule not to deploy knight forces.
In this situation, the Kingdom of Naurillia had played its trump card by deploying a squire. Naurillia had broken the unspoken rule. Even though the person on the battlefield was in the process of transitioning from squire to proto-knight, crossing the line was crossing the line.
"Those bastards!"
The Duke of Azpen exploded in anger. His eyes turned red, and veins bulged on his forehead.
"Send ours out too!"
Just because he commanded it didn't mean they could be sent out immediately.
It was winter.
Starting a war in winter would severely weaken both nations. If a full-scale war was expected instead of a skirmish, they would need to gather their national strength. Moreover, Azpen's main forces were currently absent for some reason. To fight properly, Azpen also needed time.
At the end of the war, no matter how furious the other side was, with their heads ready to explode like a volcano, they had to endure it as winter approached.
Naurillia had likely anticipated this and deployed their forces at the end of the war. Conversely, Azpen had read the timing of winter's approach and deployed a sorcerer.
However, their prepared sword was blocked, while the other side’s dagger was deeply embedded in their arm. It hurt. If things went wrong, they might lose the use of an arm.
"Apply diplomatic pressure. It's an issue that they deployed a knight to the battlefield."
The Duke of Azpen, known for his belligerence, couldn’t let this go, speaking with a voice simmering with rage.
The Principality of Azpen was a country supported by three families.
The Duke of Azpen.
The power of Hurrier.
And the administration and state affairs of Ekins.
Diplomacy was the responsibility of the Ekins family. Ekins' ambassador was in a difficult position. It was because of the letter from Naurillia. The letter had arrived around the same time the Red Cloak Knight was deployed, indicating that Naurillia had perfectly prepared their excuse.
The letter stated that a Frog General from Azpen had appeared in the enemy camp, and they had deployed the knight to counter him. The reason was plausible. It was too appropriate.
Why did that Frog General have to be there?
Frogs naturally lived as they pleased. Problems like this were inevitable when they were put into military roles.
‘Even if it wasn't a general, they would have found another excuse.’
Ekins were no fool. Naurillia wouldn't have impulsively sent a knight. The Frog General was just a convenient excuse, but even if it weren't him, Naurillia would have come up with a suitable justification.
In conclusion, Azpen had been played. The root of this issue was the failure of their sorcery.
If the Fog of Annihilation had succeeded, unless a true knight appeared, the long, drawn-out skirmishes on the Green Pearl Plains would have been a decisive victory for Azpen. Ekins recalled the report that an enemy soldier had disrupted the sorcery.
‘Are they really blaming it on one enemy soldier for their failure in vigilance?’
How could that make sense?
Everyone involved in this would be held accountable. The sorcerer had been found dead after the retreat. Whether it was passing bandits or someone else, both the sorcerer and his escorts were found cut in half.
‘Nothing is going right.’
"Are we just going to let this go?"
The Duke forgot his dignity and shouted. The secret plan Ekins had strongly pushed for this fall had backfired. The skirmishes ended with Azpen’s defeat.
After ten days, Enkrid felt fully recovered. So, the moment he got up, he immediately sought out Rem.
"Rem."
"What is it?"
Rem, who had just finished his guard duty, stood before Enkrid.
"Let's spar."
"Spar?"
"A duel."
"......Didn’t you just recover?"
What does that matter?
He was itching to fight now. Enkrid expressed it with his face. If that was a skill, it was a skill. Conveying his thoughts through just his eyebrows and lips.
"Alright. If you want to, you should. You’ll just get beaten up again."
"Come at me, you arrogant barbarian."
"Oh boy, do you want your leg broken this time?"
Rem accepted Enkrid’s provocation with a laugh. The two soon stepped outside. Ragna, watching this, agreed with Rem on one thing despite the rest. The squad leader was the craziest person he had ever seen.
How could someone with such little talent immediately challenge others to fights as soon as he got up?
Less than thirty minutes later, Enkrid opened the door again.
"Ragna, your turn. I’ll cleanse your laziness."
A delighted squad leader. Blood crusted on one side of his head where he had been bleeding, but he wore a bright expression.
"Yes, yes, let's do it."
Ragna didn't waste energy arguing. A few rounds would do. This was their routine.
Chapter 50: "The Unexpected Can Kill You" (1)
After the battle, Enkrid dutifully served as part of the standing army in Border Guard. He took turns on guard duty and patrolled the city. When not on duty, he immersed himself in his training, focusing on his swordsmanship.
For those who saw Enkrid for the first time, his repetitive routine might have seemed overwhelming. However, to those who knew him, it was just another peaceful part of their daily life.
Not that Enkrid would have cared if someone had noticed. He was deeply absorbed in his thoughts, constantly pondering.
‘How can I win?’
Rather, how can I swing my sword better?
This was a time for him to review and reflect on what he had learned. Watching the squire had sparked a fierce desire within him to surpass them, but he wasn't impatient.
Slowly, proceeding one step at a time. No matter how slow it was, he always moved forward. That was Enkrid's specialty.
‘Heart of the Beast, Blade Sense, Focus Point.’
He used everything he had learned from Rem, Jaxon, and Ragna in his sparring sessions. Initially, he sparred mostly with Rem. Later, Ragna joined in. Then, occasionally, Jaxon would join.
“When your brain turns to muscle, I'll be here to refresh you.”
“Hmm? Was that directed at me?”
A casual comment sparked a playful tension between Rem and Jaxon, but to Enkrid, it was just a peaceful daily routine.
Sparring with Rem was intense. It required quick thinking and immediate judgment. It was about daring and concentrating, relying on instinct over thought.
Sparring with Ragna was different. It focused on swordsmanship itself. Even if Enkrid started aggressively, a moment of carelessness could put him on the defensive. He had to remain aware of the flow of the fight throughout.
Jaxon's approach was different from both. He used many tricks, deceiving with sounds, footwork, hand gestures, or slight shoulder movements. It required paying attention to every move, making it a mental as well as a physical battle.
“Clear your mind. Focus on the present.”
That was Jaxon’s advice. By then, the image of the squire had faded from Enkrid's mind. He repeated his training daily.
Two weeks after returning to Border Guard, a ceremony for meritorious service took place.
“These are the heroes who contributed to our victory against the treacherous Azpen!”
The battalion commander distributed rewards, with Enkrid receiving the highest.
“We bestow this reward for identifying and dispelling the sorcery!”
The adjutant loudly proclaimed Enkrid’s contribution.
‘They’re actually giving me credit?’
Enkrid had expected the command to claim his achievement, but they had acknowledged his contribution openly.
Among the lined-up commanders beside the battalion commander, the emerald-eyed elf stood out. What had the company commander done? Enkrid didn’t know and doubted asking would yield answers.
“Our victory!”
The battalion commander declared victory again, but it didn't stir the same frenzy as on the last night of the battlefield.
The soldiers led by the squad leader clapped. As Enkrid returned to his place, a few soldiers at the back glanced at him, muttering.
“Sorcery? He broke that flag alone?”
“Probably one of his squad members did it.”
“No way he did it alone.”
“They say the fog was sorcery and he dispelled it. That squad leader? No way.”
Knowing Enkrid's usual demeanor, it was understandable, but Rem wasn’t having it.
“Do these guys miss the taste of my axe?”
He said it expressionlessly, but the meaning was clear and frightening. This was a guy who habitually knocked soldiers' heads for fun.
“Why are we even doing this? We could use this time to get more sleep.”
Ragna grumbled, glancing behind. The battalion commander's speech seemed terribly dull. As the squad leader, Enkrid tried to pacify him. The battalion commander rambled on about his role in the battle, claiming he had sent out the recon squad and immediately recognized the banner as sorcery. It was all nonsense. Boredom led to increased grumbling behind Enkrid.
“Maybe that useless dipshit squad leader sneaks into the battalion commander's quarters?”
“Hey, don’t talk nonsense.”
The soldier who used the slur laughed louder at his own words. Enkrid had heard it all before. It wasn’t even worth acknowledging.
However, his squad members felt differently.
“Having fun, huh?”
It was Jaxon. Somehow, he had slipped between the two soldiers, throwing his arms around their shoulders. Enkrid hadn’t even noticed Jaxon move.
The soldiers flinched visibly. Jaxon lowered his head between them, whispering something. His lips couldn't be read, but after his words, the soldiers fell silent, their faces pale. Jaxon calmly returned to his place.
“What did you say?”
Rem asked, curious. Ragna perked up, as did the others. They didn’t care about the gossip, but Enkrid was curious about Jaxon’s words.
“Just some advice, life advice.”
“Bullshit.”
Rem scoffed. Enkrid hadn't seen it, and neither had Kraiss, but the other three had. Jaxon’s hands had held short knives, their tips pressing into the soldiers’ throats.
“Do you also need any advice?”
Jaxon asked Rem casually. Rem laughed, veins bulging on his forehead.
“Quiet. The battalion commander is speaking.”
Enkrid intervened just in time. Despite Jaxon's intimidation, the resentment towards Enkrid persisted.
Jealousy and resentment mixed into the criticism. He had been insignificant, a man scraping by thanks to his squad members. A lowest-tier soldier. And now he had dispelled sorcery.
The battalion commander personally praised him, and the kingdom sent a reward. More soldiers resented than celebrated him.
In Naurillia, a snake was seen as vile, jealous, and resentful— it was a creature that couldn't stand others' success. Thus, they called this behavior 'snake-like.' The soldiers’ behavior was precisely that. Despite Enkrid’s role in breaking the sorcery and saving them, many couldn’t acknowledge it.
“Really, that squad leader?”
Their words encapsulated the situation. Doubt, contempt, jealousy.
“Hmm, everyone’s really chatty.”
Even Kraiss, who usually brushed things off, commented.
The battalion commander's speech finally ended. The leather pouch he received was heavy. If it wasn't filled with bronze coins, it was a significant amount.
Enkrid decided to buy a sword with it.
“Scatter! Shift change!”
The adjutant signaled the end of the tedious session.
“Want to spar now? Do you have a shift?”
As the group dispersed, Enkrid asked Rem. Rem found Enkrid fascinating.
“Ever think about messing with those guys instead?”
“Why? Would it help?”
He only cared about his sword. Seeing that, Rem felt a warm fondness for him. Punishing those mouthy soldiers could wait.
“Let’s spar.”
Rem recalled the first time he saw Enkrid in Border Guard. Back then, he was beyond lousy, relying on tricks.
But now?
Images of their recent bouts flashed in his mind.
‘Where did he learn such fundamentals?’
The swordsmanship resembled that of a well-trained noble house.
“You’ve improved a lot.”
With that, Rem raised his game. He had to. Playing around wouldn’t cut it anymore. Rem took it in stride, but Ragna was more surprised after sparring with Enkrid.
‘I couldn’t teach him better myself.’
Enkrid's skill had grown significantly. His fundamentals and focus were impressive. This wasn’t unusual.
Focus Point was a trance-like state, which was achievable with enough talent. Ragna had experienced it himself. It was surprising that Enkrid had reached it, but...
‘It’s not impossible.’
Thinking that way was typical of a genius like Ragna. Jaxon found joy in sparring with the significantly improved Enkrid.
‘Is this enjoyable?’
What was a sword? A spear? A weapon?
They were tools for killing. He had always treated them as such.
But sparring with Enkrid left him feeling refreshed, oddly at peace. It was a curious sensation. He felt a stronger bond with Enkrid because of it.
Audin Pumray, the devout squad member, observed Enkrid intently. His insight was unique.
‘Improving so much in a day?’
Had Enkrid always had this talent?
If so, why hadn’t he shown more progress before?
It was possible to hit a plateau in learning and improvement. Audin knew this, but something always felt off about Enkrid.
‘Something’s strangely different.’
He chose not to dwell on it. Believing it to be a divine blessing made it easier to accept.
Enkrid had worked tirelessly, training relentlessly. If someone like him didn’t deserve a blessing, who would?
Audin pondered these thoughts deeply.
“This one looks good.”
Enkrid had bought a new sword.
“It’s not just good. That’s mixed with Valerian steel!”
The blacksmith’s veins bulged as he spoke.
“Really?”
Enkrid examined the blade. There was no telltale bluish hue of Valerian steel. As he scrutinized the sword, the blacksmith clarified.
“I said mixed, not pure Valerian steel.”
“Right.”
Valerian steel was renowned across the continent. It was highly elastic and durable. A Valerian steel sword retained its edge well and rarely chipped.
In battle, a sturdy sword was a reliable ally. Everyone wanted Valerian steel weapons.
Imperial steel was also highly prized but not exported from the Empire. Valerian steel was the best available alternative.
“I’ll take it.”
The sword cost half of his reward, making Kraiss shake his head.
“Why spend so much on a sword? You could use one from the battlefield or request one from the supply.”
“Wouldn’t you regret it if a poor-quality sword got you killed?”
“...Fair point. So, going for a rank promotion now?”
“Yes.”
After endless sparring and recent training, Enkrid felt ready to test his skills.
‘How far can I go?’
He was at the lowest rank now. He aimed for at least the middle rank. After that, the upper rank, or the highest,or maybe the special rank?
Naurillia had introduced a rank system to boost soldiers' morale. To advance, one had to defeat someone of a higher rank. Challenges were always accepted, and there were people who arranged these duels. It was a simple but effective system.
“Okay, let’s go.”
Kraiss arranged these duels for money. Promotional duels involved betting, which was profitable. Higher-ups knew about the betting but turned a blind eye. Some even placed bets themselves.
“I’ve bet on your victory.”
Kraiss said. It wasn’t purely his judgment. He had grilled Rem for information.
“If you’re smart, bet on him.”
Rem wasn’t one to make idle comments, so Kraiss trusted him.
‘If I lose...’
He wouldn’t let it slide. He wouldn’t confront Rem, knowing it would end badly.
“Promotion duel?”
The squad leader nodded.
“No need to stay at the lowest rank.”
With permission granted and Kraiss arranging the duel at the central training ground, a few idle soldiers gathered. It wasn’t much of a spectacle, but the notorious accident-prone squad leader was involved.
The one who broke the sorcery fog.
The one rumored to rely on his squadmates.
Hence, the crowd grew. More and more eyes gathered. Over twenty spectators watched as Enkrid faced his opponent. A curly-haired mercenary turned soldier.
“I’m mid-rank. You’re challenging a mid-rank directly?”
“Yes.”
“You’re cocky.”
The short exchange ended, and swords clashed. Enkrid parried the opponent’s strike.
Clang!
Steel met steel with a resounding ring. Enkrid awaited the next attack. He had always done so. Rem, Ragna and Jaxon exploited his openings in sparring.
In real combat, too.
The thrust-loving pervert.
The mad Hurrier from Azpen.
None had been easy opponents, always pressing his weaknesses. But this opponent was different.
Clang! Clang!
After a few more exchanges, Enkrid frowned.
‘Is this a joke?’
His opponent’s skill was far below his expectation. It was hard to tell if he was serious.
“Hah!”
The mid-rank soldier swung. There were too many openings. Enkrid dodged, pretending to block, and tripped him with a foot hook.
Thud, whoosh, wham.
The soldier’s right foot flew up as he fell, hitting the ground hard.
“Ow!”
He clutched his wrist, rolling in pain. Enkrid hadn’t expected this. His mind flooded with questions.
‘Why is he so weak?’
That was Enkrid’s main concern.
Chapter 51: "The Unexpected Can Kill You" (2)
“Lucky.”
One of the soldiers watching the duel muttered. He was a former mercenary and one of the men who had complained during Enkrid's commendation ceremony.
Frowning, he stepped forward.
“Not tired, are you? How about another round?”
To advance, Enkrid needed to be recognized by three mid-rank soldiers or defeat three of them in succession. Facing one opponent wasn’t enough.
“Uh, Squad Leader?”
Kraiss glanced nervously at the tension brewing. Enkrid looked curiously at the fallen soldier.
Was this really happening?
He had won with just a simple trip. The fallen soldier clutched his wrist and stood up.
“Lucky bastard.”
As he withdrew, tears of pain welled in his eyes. It must have hurt, but tearing up seemed excessive. Enkrid turned his gaze to his next opponent, assuming his stance.
“I’m not tired.”
“Good. In that case, I’ll be your next opponent.”
Enkrid briefly reviewed the previous fight.
‘Luck was on my side.’
The soldier had fallen without even trying to protect himself. He hadn't anticipated being taken down.
‘Why?’
Overconfidence led to underestimating the opponent, but could a simple trip decide the fight?
Did that make sense?
He didn't know. He just needed to try again. His opponent drew a spear.
The infantry battalion stationed in Border Guard had two main types of soldiers. One was the light infantry, and the other heavy infantry.
Heavy infantry often used long spears as weapons. They were well-trained soldiers Border Guard had invested heavily in, and were more trained and skilled compared to the light infantry.
The opponent twirled the tip of his spear. Enkrid didn't let his gaze be drawn to it.
“When fighting, keep your eyes on your opponent’s entire body.”
That was Ragna’s advice, and Enkrid followed it faithfully.
Whoosh.
The spear aimed for his side. It was a swift, predatory thrust.
‘Slow.’
But compared to the thrusting maniac he had met on his first repeated day, it was slow. He could clearly see its trajectory and easily dodge it. Enkrid shifted his stance, using his left foot as a pivot, and intercepted the spear at his side.
When the spear was subdued with a thud, the opponent tried to pull it back. Enkrid matched the pull, charging forward.
“Huh?”
Expecting resistance, the soldier gasped as Enkrid came at him with the spear. The startled soldier raised his left arm to guard while holding the spear with both hands.
Enkrid feigned a stab at his eyes, then tripped him with a well-placed foot to the shin. With his left foot forward and his shoulder thrusting into the soldier’s chest, he pushed him over.
Thud.
With a heavy thud, the soldier hit the ground, breath knocked out of him. There was no need to point his sword. Enkrid looked down from above. The heavy infantryman from the 1st Platoon of the 1st Company stared up at him, seeing the accident-prone squad leader looming above, twice his size.
It was the psychological pressure of being overpowered.
‘Shit.’
Despite his breathlessness from the blow, he cursed the one who had mocked the squad leader, including himself.
‘How is he low-rank?’
Enkrid asked, “More?”
“No, no more.”
The second mid-rank soldier stepped back, and the third stepped forward.
“Idiots.”
One of the soldiers watching the duel muttered. It was Andrew.
Andrew, who had gone on the reconnaissance mission with Enkrid, had already thought he was beyond mid-rank level, but he was even better now. His swordsmanship had matured significantly since then.
Andrew praised himself for betting all his coins on Enkrid. He also pondered who would win if they fought now. He had also been diligently training. Next to him, Mack commented on Andrew’s observation.
“What happened to him?”
“Why?”
“He’s improved too much.”
“How much?”
Seeing Andrew’s expression, Mack shook his head.
“He’s different now.”
After their reconnaissance mission, Mack had told Andrew to get more experience before properly challenging the squad leader. Now, he needed to retract that advice.
“If we fight now, it’ll be difficult. Even for me.”
Mack, a highly skilled swordsman who had been mentoring Andrew, had admitted it. Andrew nodded. This was expected. After all, Enkrid had knocked him out with one blow. For the first time in his life, he felt naturally inclined to follow someone.
Vengeance also watched the duel. Returning from duty, he saw the commotion at the training ground.
“What’s happening?”
A subordinate explained, and Vengeance, leaning his spear and helmet on the ground, watched. Enkrid had fought twice and won twice. It sounded easy, but those with a keen eye could see the skill involved.
‘If that’s luck.’
Then the goddess of fortune would have to be reincarnated as a man.
The third opponent hesitated to step forward. Kraiss realized his squad leader was a better fighter than he had thought. He also had a knack for reading people. So, he decided to directly call out the next opponent.
“You there, 2nd Platoon, right? How about a match?”
If Kraiss believed in anything, he could be a bold instigator. He would provoke an opponent if needed.
“Me?”
The number of spectators had grown significantly. Stepping up and getting beaten wasn’t appealing.
“Who else would I mean? You were so confident calling him a manwhore from the back.”
Kraiss smirked, mocking the soldier. The provocation worked.
“Damn it. Fine, I’ll fight.”
The foul-mouthed soldier spat on the ground and stepped forward. Standing on the soft dirt, he faced Enkrid, who had just finished reviewing his second fight.
‘I’ve been in tougher fights.’
This was too easy. Rem and the others had always said the rank system was a mess.
“Not all mid-ranks are equal. Even the high ranks have too much variance. Winning a fight to the death isn’t always about skill alone. Plenty of people on the continent are skilled enough to outthink their opponents and win.”
That was Rem’s view. Yet, to be recognized, one had to climb the rank system.
‘Unless you rise above the system itself.’
Those who stood above the rank system. The Red Cloak Knights’ elite.
Border Guard housed two battalions. They rotated between guarding Green Pearl and city duty. Usually, one battalion and a reserve unit stayed in the city.
Enkrid’s unit, the 1st Battalion, was currently stationed in the city. Half of the 2nd Battalion was deployed in the field at Green Pearl, defending the fortifications.
Every year, they alternated winter duties, a role for the Border Guard’s standing army. The city, with fewer than ten thousand residents, housed two infantry battalions and a direct unit of the kingdom. Although this was the first time a Red Cloak Knights member had personally entered the field, they occasionally sent representatives. This was possible because Border Guard was a royal territory.
In the past, when relations with Azpen were good, Border Guard was a trade city for spices and various goods. After Azpen’s invasion, it transformed into a military city and fortress. Walls were built higher, and watchtowers erected.
The three towers symbolized Naurillia’s vigilance against Azpen. Thus, the stationed units were highly skilled.
Border Guard gathered seasoned troops with combat experience. So, the current soldier should have been just as capable. No one here would be an easy opponent.
At the start of this campaign, the field had been full of capable soldiers, more than enough to challenge Enkrid.
“Are you distracted?”
The opponent asked.
“No.”
Enkrid’s heart skipped a beat, but he shook his head. Never underestimate your opponent.
Countless instructors had stressed this. To follow that advice, Enkrid recalled the city’s strategic importance. Underestimation had once seemed irrelevant.
‘Who am I to underestimate?’
But now, he needed to heed that advice. He didn’t feel amused. He was just satisfied. Separate from the joy of growth, proving and showcasing his skills brought Enkrid happiness.
“What’s so amusing?”
The opponent asked again. Enkrid realized he was smiling faintly.
“Fighting is fun.”
“Crazy.”
His opponent steadied his breath and attacked. He swung his sword vertically. Enkrid watched the trajectory and moved. He gathered strength from his planted foot through his knee to his waist, channeling it into his sword to strike his opponent’s blade.
Clang!
The sound of metal echoed. His opponent’s chest opened. Enkrid feigned a thrust, causing his opponent to draw back defensively. Instead of following through, Enkrid raised his blade and closed the distance. He met the startled soldier’s eyes, locked blades, hooked his left foot behind the soldier’s heel, and pushed forward with his sword.
The soldier barely managed to bring his sword to his chest. With the blades locked, the soldier couldn’t attack. He fell helplessly.
Thud.
He fell hard, landing on his rear. Enkrid pressed his sword to the soldier’s head. Everything happened in an instant. With these three fights, Enkrid had proven his skill. The fallen soldier looked up at the blade above him.
“...I lost.”
He admitted.
Naurillia had always revered the strong, earning its reputation as the land of knights.
Andrew and Mack. Vengeance, who was watching from behind. The elf company commander, who had come to watch. Rem, Ragna, and the rest of the accident-prone squad. Even the soldiers who had once mocked Enkrid.
No one spoke.
The sunlight angled, reflecting off the blade. It lit up half of Enkrid’s face. The light, the shadows, the cold air rising from his shoulders created a surreal scene.
It was as if they saw Enkrid in the heart of the battlefield, tearing through the sorcery-bound flag. They had denied and pushed away the truth, but now it settled in their minds. The one who had broken the fog of annihilation was their savior.
“Didn’t expect that.”
Someone muttered. It was an acknowledgment. When they didn’t know his skill, they criticized. Now, they couldn’t. Acting petty was over. The second defeated soldier spoke up.
“I spoke out of turn. I apologize.”
Enkrid nodded silently. The standing army of Border Guard was full of people like this. They couldn’t tolerate those who didn’t prove themselves. That was the rough nature of Border Guard’s forces.
Conversely, once proven, respect was given. Enkrid had earned respect by overwhelming mid-rank soldiers.
“Sorcery Breaker.”
Someone muttered. There were no cheers. It wasn’t the atmosphere for that, but the nickname seemed to stick.
The Sorcery Breaker. It was a bit much.
Enkrid thought and wondered what to do next. He spoke.
“Time to fight a high-ranking soldier.”
He had defeated three mid-rank soldiers with ease.
So, what next?
What was left?
A high-ranking soldier, of course.
Thinking of another fight already?
Kraiss widened his eyes, unable to believe his squad leader. Did he need to set up another duel?
“Whistle.”
Someone whistled and stepped forward, smiling.
“Interesting.”
The soldier had an eagle emblem on his badge. It marked him as part of the royal Frontier Guard, as notorious as Azpen’s Gray Hounds.
Known as Frontier Slaughterers, they were the most ruthless unit in Border Guard. A two-hundred-strong unit, all high-rank soldiers or higher, directly under the king.
One of them had stepped forward.
Chapter 52: The Turtle and the Frontier Slaughterer (1)
"Why don't you try me?"
A soldier stepped forward. His appearance was ordinary. He was a bit shorter than Enkrid, but he looked sturdy. The sharp blade of the shortsword in his hanging hand reflected the light.
The Frontier Slaughterers of the Border Guard were an elite force. They were a direct force of only two hundred, but the battalion commander and the commander of the direct force held the same rank.
According to Naurillia’s organization, they were part of the royal army. This meant their chain of command was separated from the infantry of the 1st and 2nd units stationed in Border Guard.
The Frontier Slaughterer looked at Enkrid with indifferent eyes. It wasn't a provocative gaze. Rather, it was closer to a contemptuous one, as if looking at someone inferior. This provoked Enkrid's competitive spirit, making him feel it was worth trying.
Enkrid was pleased.
'I can fight.'
Unlike the past, when he would collapse immediately due to lack of skill or be crushed by talent before even starting, how was he now?
He was savoring the joy of this change for a moment. People around him started murmuring, perhaps thinking that Enkrid hesitated.
"Sorcery Breaker."
"Troublemaker Squad Leader."
"Give it a go."
"How special can he be?"
Even though he had only sparred three times briefly, everyone cheered for Enkrid.
It was a peculiar experience. He had never experienced anything like this in his life. It was a first for Enkrid.
"Let's go!"
"Show them!"
"The flower of the battlefield is!"
"The infantry!"
They were even shouting the infantry’s motto. It was amusing because his opponent was also part of the infantry. Regardless, their support was clearly conveyed.
The desire to fight. The thirst that couldn't be satisfied with just mid-rank soldiers. The discipline of the infantry behind him gathered. A thrilling sensation surged through his entire body from his toes.
Vengeance, watching the situation from outside, understood the support for Enkrid.
'It makes sense.'
Even Vengeance himself had shouted to show support to Enkrid. A low-rank soldier who swung his sword even in his sleeping hours. The squad leader who controlled the Troublemaker Squad.
His rank was insignificant. His skill was poor compared to his effort. That was the evaluation until now. Everyone would have thought similarly.
But what about now?
Enkrid, the Troublemaker Squad Leader, showed a completely different side. He proved himself by demonstrating excellent skills. By breaking the sorcery, he saved the lives of his allies and changed the course of the battlefield. That moment became a reality.
It was something that they knew but doubted.
That doubt became reality, and now everyone knew. Who was the most meritorious in the previous battle?
The battalion commander’s commendation and a pouch of krona replaced the merit. As in any army, this one also had a culture of upper ranks benefiting. Especially now, the battalion commander’s reputation was not good.
There were rumors that he saw his soldiers merely as expendables. Many soldiers who had noticed Enkrid’s skills subtly included themselves.
Among them was Bell. The soldier Enkrid had protected from the arrows of the Hawk's Talon with his shield.
‘I knew it!’
He had recognized him since he saved his life. The Troublemaker Squad Leader was capable of anything.
‘Of course.’
That wasn't all. The hearts of all those who had unknowingly become connected with him came together. Enkrid was now representing the ordinary soldiers of Border Guard.
With their support, Enkrid kicked the tip of his sword with his foot, taking his stance. At the same time, he suppressed the thrilling excitement and controlled his breathing.
"You want to fight?"
"I don't see a reason to avoid it."
Seeing Enkrid stepping forward indifferently, Torres, one of the Frontier Slaughterers, thought inwardly.
'Interesting?'
The Frontier Slaughterers.
Despite the fearsome reputation of his unit, his opponent did not avoid him. Instead, he stepped up to fight. There was even a faint smile on his face. It was amusing. It was enjoyable. At the same time, it was unpleasant. He wanted to show the difference between a regular soldier and a special forces soldier.
Whoosh.
Torres lunged first. His feet moved frighteningly fast. Enkrid waited and then thrust his sword towards the center. It was a good move.
Whether left or right, up or down, his opponent would have to dodge. The moment he dodged, a heavy blow would follow.
Torres did not dodge. He raised his sword to meet Enkrid's incoming blade.
The moment the blades met, Enkrid tried to press down with his strength, but his opponent performed a skillful move.
Clang!
As their blades clashed, Torres twisted his sword upwards, making their swords form a diagonal line. The downward force went astray. It was the basic technique of deflecting with the flowing sword style.
Sparks flew as their blades met. As the downward force deflected to the side, Enkrid didn't hesitate and brought his right foot, which was behind, forward to kick.
Pak!
Before the kick reached its target, Torres blocked Enkrid's shin with his palm. The distance closed in. It was even closer than the range of the swords. Torres abandoned his shortsword and lunged further into Enkrid's space. He crossed his hands and grabbed Enkrid’s collar, aiming to choke him.
Enkrid, indifferent to being choked, pulled his sword upward between his legs. It was a move targeting the opponent's back with a backhand strike. Even if he was choked, he wouldn’t pass out immediately, and in the meantime, he could leave a significant scar on the special forces soldier's back.
Torres twisted his body. Instead of grabbing the collar, he pushed Enkrid's chest with both hands. Enkrid resisted the push. Instead of retreating, he changed the direction of his sword and swung it horizontally.
Since Torres had abandoned his shortsword, his defeat was inevitable. One side had a weapon, and the other did not.
Which side had the advantage?
But here, Enkrid experienced something new. His opponent suddenly disappeared.
‘Disappeared?’
His concentration broke. His opponent vanished from his sight. There was no sound either. Instinct then moved Enkrid. Countless deaths had ingrained this instinct into him.
It was the survival instinct earned by struggling countless times each day to see tomorrow. He instinctively grasped his sword with only his right hand and bent his head back, exposing his chest.
At the same time, a flash of light rose from below Enkrid’s chest.
Flick!
The flash grazed his cheek. In that brief moment, Enkrid reactivated his Focus Point. If he missed, he would die. His instincts left a vivid warning. The rising flash suddenly dropped.
Enkrid didn’t miss it. He caught the flash with his left palm and raised his knee.
Pak-Puk!
A burning pain shot through his palm. He saw Torres’ eyes twitch as he got closer. Blood trickled from Enkrid's left palm, which had caught the dagger’s blade. The result of Torres’ lethal stab with a dagger he had drawn after abandoning his shortsword.
A drop of blood fell to the ground.
Then, more drops followed, and Torres sighed before making a gesture to pull out his dagger. Enkrid let go of the blade. Pain surged through his left hand. A burning pain. He felt a throbbing pain and blood flowing from his cheek.
His cheek had been cut earlier. If he hadn't dodged, his chin would have split. He could consider himself lucky. It was not because of instinct.
‘That was close.’
Enkrid thought.
"You're lucky. Right?"
Then, Rem’s voice was heard. Rem was standing right behind Torres, with his axe on his shoulder. He was within striking distance if he swung the axe.
Beside Rem, Ragna stood with his left hand on his sword, taking half a step forward. It was the stance he took when demonstrating his sword-drawing technique.
"You can't go further than this."
Ragna muttered. If these two had Torres covered, there was another person standing next to Torres.
It was Jaxon, the squad member with auburn hair. He wasn’t holding a weapon, but he looked more dangerous than Rem and Ragna. The instincts that had surged during the spar told him so.
And these three were not the end.
Enkrid's gaze fell to the ground. Between him and his opponent, a blade was blocking the gap. It was a fairy sword resembling a leaf, the Naidhl sword.
"That's enough. I’m the fourth company commander. Any more and it’s killing an ally."
It was the elf company commander. Her sword had intervened between them.
"Why so hostile? It’s just a spar. A few more strikes, and someone would have ended up with several holes."
Torres retrieved his dagger. He rubbed his stomach, which had been hit by Enkrid, and raised both hands. Only then did those who had been holding their breath watching the spar exhale.
"He's damn good."
"No way, how is he a low-rank soldier?"
There was no need for a judge.
"At least a high-rank!"
They had an eye for it too. Who was the opponent?
"I'm Torres, the platoon leader of the Frontier Slaughterers."
He tapped his insignia and extended his hand. Enkrid sheathed his sword and extended his uninjured right hand.
"I'm Enkrid, squad leader from the fourth platoon, fourth company."
Since his opponent spoke formally, Enkrid also saluted properly.
"I've heard of the Troublemaker Squad Leader."
Everyone in the city who knew Enkrid, knew him well. Torres showed a friendly smile. He didn't look like someone who had just fought for his life.
"You fight well. Let's meet again."
Torres said and turned away. As he walked through the crowd of onlookers, the soldiers made way for him. The Frontier Slaughterers were highly regarded even among their allies.
A platoon leader from such a unit acknowledged Enkrid, the soldier who had broken the sorcery and saved the battalion in the previous battle.
"Why is he good-looking too?"
Someone remarked, seeing Enkrid brush his sweat-soaked bangs back. Everyone in the training field had their eyes on Enkrid. Though unintentional, it became a turning point in changing everyone's perception.
Oddly, after this event, no one spoke ill of Enkrid.
"Who? That squad leader? Isn't he a sly fox relying on his squad?"
If a soldier who hadn't witnessed the sparring said this, they were reprimanded instead.
"That’s nonsense. Didn’t he save our lives in the last battle?"
"What?"
The soldier who had been on leave was taken aback by his comrade’s reaction.
"Don't you know the Sorcery Breaker? Do you think that sorcery broke itself, you idiot!"
Before his leave, hadn’t they all cursed the Troublemaker Squad Leader together? The change in his comrades was too drastic. And it wasn't just this one person. The soldier who returned from leave got swept up in the atmosphere.
He felt it was right.
'Didn't they say he broke the sorcery?'
He even received recognition for it. He thought the Troublemaker Squad Leader might have done something extraordinary. Those who said it was thanks to his squad disappeared. Bell was at the forefront.
"I almost died from an arrow, and he appeared and blocked it."
Vengeance naturally played a part.
"There was a fire. Although I hadn't been friendly, he saved me. I heard he carried me out of the flames and collapsed. It was Enkrid who broke the sorcery. I saw him charge at the front with my own eyes!"
Andrew joined in.
"I always thought he was exceptional. It wasn’t me who led the reconnaissance, but Enkrid."
‘Mr.’ was sometimes added to his name.
Andrew's caretaker, Mack, also contributed.
"During the reconnaissance mission, he threw himself into the most dangerous positions. His swordsmanship? I’m not qualified to comment."
Mack was one of the best among the regular soldiers. The atmosphere changed completely.
However, this did not change everyday life. There was much talk about the Troublemaker Squad Leader’s skills, but not much else changed.
"A high-rank soldier?"
To the battalion commander, a soldier being promoted to high-rank wasn’t a big deal. To him, the Troublemaker Squad Leader was just a slightly annoying presence. So he ignored it.
Enkrid didn’t get caught up in the atmosphere. He just tended to his wounds and did his best on guard duty. Two days after the promotion ceremony, Enkrid was on guard duty at the south gate of the Border Guard with Rem.
"Was this all planned? You're cunning, Squad Leader."
Rem said.
"What?"
"These days, the kids are all over you, pretending not to notice."
Enkrid had ears and eyes. Especially with Kraiss, who loved gossip, around. He knew everything.
At first, he was proud. Even if it was a desperate struggle to survive, it was true that he had broken the sorcery. But pride was just pride. Enkrid soon returned to his usual self. Training and honing his skills.
"Aren’t you bored?"
"No. How about a spar after duty?"
"Sure."
Rem chuckled. He liked the squad leader’s consistency.
After duty, as they were returning to the barracks, someone blocked their way.
It was an unfamiliar face.
"Can we talk for a moment?"
Before Rem could raise an eyebrow and ask who he was, Enkrid responded.
"Sure."
Enkrid knew this face. It was clear that it wouldn’t be good to act friendly in front of Rem.
"Go ahead."
Enkrid sent Rem off.
"Do you not need me to stay?"
"Just go away."
Enkrid said, horrified at Rem trying to act like a caretaker.
"You complain even when I look after you."
"Don’t."
"I’ll sulk if you abandon me. I’ll sulk like a teenage girl!"
Rem kept nagging till the end. Annoying guy.
Enkrid patted Rem’s back, signaling he understood. Rem went in obediently. The man, who had been watching this, shook his head slightly.
"Your discipline is a mess."
"Why do you think we’re called the Troublemaker Squad?"
It was right in front of the barracks. The man started walking along the low wall of the military base. Enkrid walked beside him.
"You know who I am, right?"
"You're the company commander of the 1st Company, aren’t you?"
The man nodded.
1st Battalion, 1st Company.
He was the commander of the heavy infantry, the pride of the Border Guard.
Chapter 53: The Turtle and the Frontier Slaughterer (2)
"Don't you want to transfer to another company?"
They had walked less than five steps from the barracks. It wasn’t common to recruit soldiers directly from within the unit.
‘Is it because I became a high-rank soldier?’
That might be it. There weren’t many high-rank or top-rank soldiers in the unit. Or there might be another reason.
Sorcery Breaker.
The name currently most talked about within the unit. Receiving attention and interest was a first, but that didn't mean he should get excited like a fifteen-year-old. It was enjoyable, but there were things he had to let go despite the pleasure.
Enkrid had experience. Surviving to the age of thirty while eating the food of soldiers was no small feat.
"To the 1st Company?"
"Do you think I came to put you in the pathetic Paltor Company or the Rayon Company?"
Paltor and Rayon were the names of the 2nd and 3rd Company commanders.
"Come to my unit."
Enkrid’s promotion duel was etched into everyone’s mind. Among them, Graham, the commander of the heavy infantry, particularly liked Enkrid. He was known for valuing talent within the army. He was also considered the next battalion commander.
His proposal wasn’t light. The 1st Company, famous for its heavy infantry, was the core of the Cyprus Brigade and an elite path within the army.
But Enkrid shook his head.
"I'm sorry."
A polite but firm refusal.
"You’re refusing? Why? If you’re worried about a rift with your current commander, I’ll handle it."
"That's not it."
Enkrid's response was excessively calm. There wasn't even a hint of hesitation. Graham frowned and then relaxed.
"You don’t seem to have any regrets."
"Do I?"
Graham stared at Enkrid. Enkrid met his gaze, wondering what more to say.
"It seems so."
It wasn’t something to be solved with coercion. Graham thought so.
"Then..."
Enkrid performed a military salute by pressing his left hand to his left hip and bowing his head. To receive a salute, one should at least nod, but Graham mirrored Enkrid's action. He pressed his left hand to his hip and saluted back. Then he spoke.
"Thanks."
Thanks?
Enkrid stared blankly, and Graham continued.
"You saved my life. I should thank you."
Sorcery Breaker.
That fog was terrifying. Especially for a capable commander, its impact was felt deeply. The elf company commander had cursed the battalion commander intensely during the battle. Graham had cursed the battalion commander just as much.
"That idiot, that moron!"
He had shouted this much in the middle of the battlefield. When nothing was happening, it was enough to take care of his own plate. But in a crisis, a commander’s skills were revealed.
The battalion commander was a fool. At least, Graham thought so. Especially since he subtly claimed the credit for the battle, which was the stupidest thing.
Eventually, everyone who knew realized. The top contributor in the previous battle wasn’t the battalion commander. The two men, who had been saluting blankly, broke their stances. Graham extended his hand first, and Enkrid shook it. It was a mixture of gratitude, regret, and a few other emotions.
"Go on, and don’t forget how disappointed I am."
"Should I send Rem instead?"
Enkrid joked.
"That guy? No way!"
Graham pretended to be angry and glared. The two soon parted with smiles.
‘He seems like a decent person.’
It was the first time Enkrid had such a conversation with the heavy infantry company commander. Although the barracks were just behind him, he wanted to walk a bit more.
As he walked, he looked around the city for the first time in a while. Before he knew it, he had reached the edge of the market in the center of the city. Even in a military city, it was natural for merchants and farmers to come and go.
In fact, there were far more transient merchants than those engaged in agriculture. Border Guard was called the military city of the border. The stationed troops alone exceeded 1,000.
If the number of soldiers was 1,000, the civilian population should be over 10,000. But 10,000 was obviously too much, and it was less than 5,000.
Yet the city ran well. This was a royal domain. With the support of the kingdom, the military city of Border Guard could be maintained. However, they couldn’t rely entirely on the kingdom, so they farmed and merchants came and went. The merchant hosting business was quite successful.
Recently, by the king’s order, a few merchant groups had entered the city, making the market busier than ever. Thanks to this, the innkeeper’s smile had reached the ceiling according to Kraiss's gossip.
‘No wonder he's happy.’
The market was bustling. When more merchant groups came to the city, innkeepers naturally rejoiced. One of the main businesses of the Border Guard was the lodging industry.
‘A major trade hub.’
One of the advantages of the high number of professional soldiers in the city was solid public security. There were plenty of patrols and guards. So, it often became a major trading hub for merchant groups.
A city with few residents but many visitors. A military city with the aspect of a trading city. That was the true face of Border Guard.
Enkrid glanced at the entrance of an alley transformed into a complex structure by randomly erected buildings. He turned his body around. He felt like someone was watching him, but on closer inspection, there was no one.
Enkrid turned around and walked back to the barracks.
After he left, a filthy beggar with a ragged blanket over his head crawled out from the alley. The beggar sat down and started begging. His eyes beneath the blanket were sharp. If anyone saw him, he wouldn’t look like a mere beggar.
Before entering the quarters, Rem's voice hit Enkrid's ears.
"Our Squad Leader is ready to abandon us. Be prepared, everyone."
That crazy guy.
"Is it true?"
As soon as he entered, Kraiss rushed up.
"No."
He was about to refuse and explain, but everyone’s eyes were fierce. Ragna spoke with half-closed eyes.
"If you’re leaving, take me with you."
It was a calm tone. Given his nature, Ragna didn't easily follow orders, but he said it like that. Would any unit welcome such a lazy person?
"Well, transferring units isn’t uncommon."
Jaxon nodded and checked his belongings. He seemed ready to pack up and follow at any moment. Jaxon was somewhat better but,
‘He’s here for a reason too.’
Though he kept time well, he often skipped training. He frequently disappeared, making people wonder where he went. He was friendly but selective with people.
‘It’s obvious.’
He openly showed favoritism, making it clear he wasn’t the type to blend well into the unit. Naturally, not many commanders welcomed Jaxon.
"You’re all nuts. Where would you follow? Even if they accept the squad leader, they won’t take you. You’re a hindrance. So, don’t come. I’ll go alone. Trust me. I’ll clear them out and go."
Rem puffed his chest and shouted.
‘No, you’re the biggest problem.’
Enkrid chuckled at Rem's broad back. The heavy infantry commander might accept others but definitely not Rem. He had beaten up his superior. Many in the unit hated Rem beyond dislike due to his assault on a superior officer.
Ragna and Jaxon might not be accepted, but Rem was the biggest hindrance.
"You’re definitely mentally ill. I’ve seen many like you, and they all died before thirty."
Ragna said, scratching his head as if he hadn’t washed for days.
"Then, is it time to die?"
Jaxon replied. Why those two always synced well in such moments was a mystery. Was Rem thirty? Enkrid glanced at him and saw the corners of his mouth twitching.
He was visibly angry.
"Squad Leader, can I kill those two and go with you?"
Where are you going? You can’t kill anyone.
"No."
It was best to stop it before a big fight broke out.
"I’m not going anywhere."
He tried to settle things by saying so, and Kraiss nodded. But they didn’t calm down easily.
He was about to step between them when someone knocked on the door. Only the religious squad member was missing, and he wouldn’t knock on his own door.
So it was a guest.
Enkrid gestured for Kraiss to open the door.
"Who is it?"
At Kraiss’s voice, Enkrid turned around. Beyond the flimsy wooden door stood Torres, the Frontier Slaughterer.
