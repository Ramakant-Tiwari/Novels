‘Then what methods do I have left?’
He still had a few options. He had three kinds of poisons on him. He also had a custom short weapon behind his waist. A long awl-length weapon. It was called Needle, one of the favored weapons among the elves along with Naidhl.
One stab, and it was over. So far, only one person had survived this method, a certain Frog. That damned Frog bastard.
"Why are you so ugly?"
That crazy Frog had shamelessly mocked his appearance. The half-elf had a complex about his looks. Elves were supposed to be beautiful, but half-bloods were deprived of that blessing. After meeting that Frog bastard, the half-elf always ended things by tearing his target’s heart apart.
Licking his lips when concentrating and aiming for the heart as the final blow had become his habits.
‘The poison is too precious to waste.’
Thinking of the Frog, he wanted to split his opponent’s heart. It didn’t seem like a difficult task either.
‘Close the distance, then pierce with the Needle.’
His opponent might be skilled in swordsmanship, but that was only in direct combat.
The half-elf trusted his trump card.
Now, how to close the distance?
As he pondered various methods, he noticed the idiot Rottin flinch.
‘Fool.’
The half-elf spoke.
"Don’t move, idiot."
Rottin swallowed hard at his words. As he was about to step back, the pressure made him want to flee. Having spent a long time in the Thieves’ Guild, Rottin recognized this as the air of death. His instincts were screaming alarms.
"How many do you have?"
The half-elf held Rottin with words and then raised his voice forward. Enkrid shrugged his shoulders. He was probably asking about the number of daggers in his hands.
"I have only two."
The half-elf lied. He had licked his lips countless times by now.
"I have one."
Enkrid answered honestly, despite knowing everything.
"It seems I have the advantage?"
"That’s what you think."
The dagger Enkrid had thrown was a secret weapon he had begged Kraiss for since morning. He had asked for something thin and light, and Kraiss had found it. As a result, a soldier had lost his knife used for cutting meat.
Enkrid now had a throwing knife, which had been sharpened so much that the blade had shortened to the length of a finger.
"This is really fun. You."
The elf murmured. If things went south, Whistling Daggers would fly. Even so, Enkrid agreed with the elf’s words. The tension heated his entire body.
One wrong blink, and the hand of death would strangle his neck. Yet it was enjoyable. To measure his skills against his opponent. To pit his preparations against his opponent’s. The desire to win, combined with competitiveness, filled his heart. It was something he had rarely felt before.
When had he ever had the chance to desire victory?
He had been too busy struggling to survive.
But now?
After countless deaths on the repeated today. It wasn’t just his swordsmanship that had changed. Although he naturally had a fighting spirit, he couldn’t easily wish for victory. Especially against an opponent with considerable skill.
But now?
‘I can win.’
He wanted to win, and he could win. It was a change in mindset.
"Lift the corpse. Use it as a shield."
The half-elf spoke to Rottin without caring whether Enkrid could hear.
"If he targets you, he’ll die too. He won’t use such a method. Take the crossbow as well."
The half-elf chose the most rational, efficient, and sure method from his options. Leverage the advantage of numbers. They were two. Rottin hesitated. The half-elf calmly explained the situation, as it was necessary.
"This is inside the city. Won’t patrol soldiers come around here soon?"
It was true. Enkrid only needed to buy time to gain an advantage.Soon, patrol soldiers would come. Then it would be over. Rottin knew that encountering them would mean not only losing his cover but also making survival difficult.
"Damn it."
Rottin cursed the shitty situation and carefully lifted the corpse. His back was drenched with sweat from tension.
‘When did his skills improve so much?’
Staring at Enkrid as he moved, Rottin's actions were slow. He fumbled on the ground, carefully placing the crossbow aside before lifting the corpse with the dagger in its head.
It was heavy. He groaned under the weight. One wrong step here, and it was over. Rottin focused, sweat dripping from his forehead onto the corpse.
‘Move carefully. That bastard can’t throw a knife.’
Thinking this, he used the corpse as a shield.
Whoosh, thud!
Enkrid’s arm moved. A dagger flew. Before the corpse could fully cover his body, Rottin twisted desperately. As a result, the dagger embedded in his shoulder.
"Guh."
Rottin swallowed his scream. As he took the blow, the elf’s hands moved. Both hands moved precisely four times, up and down.
Screeching!
The overlapping whistling sound grew loud. Four daggers flew. Even while throwing the dagger, Enkrid didn’t take his eyes off the half-elf.
Because he didn’t blink, he read the trajectory of the flying Whistling Daggers and immediately spread his legs and lowered his body to the ground. He bent his waist and placed his hands on the ground. The four Whistling Daggers flew towards where his head and chest had been.
All this happened in the moment after Enkrid threw his dagger and took half a breath. During the time it took for the other half of his breath, the half-elf moved his hands again. After throwing four daggers, he waited a very short moment. It was a timed attack. Two more Whistling Daggers aimed at Enkrid’s head and thigh as he supported himself on the ground with his hands.
Enkrid instinctively rolled to the side.
Thud!
The daggers struck the ground. Rolling on the ground, Enkrid quickly lifted his head to locate his enemy. Missing a dagger throw would be the end. Enkrid’s eyes darted side to side. The enemy wasn’t in sight.
He first noticed the rag fluttering in the air and the dead body of Rottin with a dagger in its arm. Enkrid’s eyes pierced through the rags. He wasn’t there. The assassin was nowhere to be seen.
Instinctively, Enkrid searched for a position to throw the dagger, causing him to miss. Meanwhile, the half-elf had lowered his stance and charged forward inside his wide field of vision.
His ears perked up, detecting the presence striking the ground.
Enkrid finally spotted the half-elf. He had already closed the distance. Only a few steps away.
Using the rags to distract and close the distance, the opponent couldn’t have predicted this. It was the half-elf’s tactic. His prediction was correct.
Enkrid’s expression was one of sheer surprise. Even so, he moved.
Ping!
‘Bastard.’
The half-elf cursed his opponent internally, forgetting his own lie. There was a third dagger in his opponent’s hand. But it wasn’t aimed at him.
The method the half-elf had considered most efficient. Numbers were always an advantage. Thanks to that. if Rottin used the crossbow to check him, it would be over.
There were no other options for him. The dagger flew with a swoosh, embedding in Rottin’s forehead instead of the corpse shield. Of course, the half-elf didn’t see this. He was just running with all his might.
Within two steps.
His hand moved to his waist. He saw his opponent desperately grabbing the longsword after throwing the dagger. Much faster than drawing and slashing, the half-elf’s short awl-like sword pierced Enkrid’s heart.
Clang! Clang!
‘Blocked?’
The half-elf was shocked. Truly astonished. This wasn’t supposed to be blocked. It was a secret move, a fatal blow. Without knowing, it couldn’t be blocked.
But it was blocked. It was unfair.
Enkrid had already seen the awl sword Needle during his ninth death. Instead of drawing the longsword, Enkrid blocked and deflected the awl sword with the blade of the guard sword he had drawn while throwing the dagger. Though it wasn’t a perfect soft and flowing Sword, he could mimic it closely enough. As a result, the blade cracked instead of piercing through.
The shattered blade scattered like light particles from his chest. Enkrid dropped the guard sword grip and drew his longsword. All this happened in one breath. Blocking, discarding, and drawing. It was a continuous, fluid motion. Drawing the longsword and striking down with all his might was like flowing water.
It happened in the brief moment the shattered blade hit the ground. Even in shock, the half-elf blocked the overhead strike with the Needle. It was too late to dodge, so it was the best defense he could manage.
Enkrid fully utilized the basics of the heavy and fierce sword style. Whatever blocked it would be broken and crushed by the sword.
Clang!
The Needle snapped like a twig, sparks flying, and the longsword’s blade fell on the half-elf’s head, fulfilling its purpose.
Thud, crack!
The hideous face of the half-elf, once mocked by the passing Frog, was now unrecognizable. His face was split in half. The longsword blade Enkrid held split the elf’s jaw.
The dead elf, with his face split, fell forward, blood gushing out, without a final scream.
"Hoo."
Enkrid exhaled the breath he had been holding. Then, retrieving his sword, he thought. Ten times, it had taken only ten times. That was the number of regressions it took to end today.
It was the shortest repetition he had ever experienced.
Chapter 61: The Elf’s Joke
Enkrid gathered the dead bodies in one place and waited for the patrol soldiers.
“This is a job, too.”
He muttered to himself as he sorted through the corpses of the half-elf assassins. While groping to move the assassins, his fingers sensed something strange. It was near the chest area. As his fingers followed the sensation, it extended to the side.
When he opened the chest, he found a sheathed dagger attached to the body. Inside, he found four remaining Whistling Daggers. They weren't common items.
‘I almost forgot.’
They were excellent weapons. He had just learned how to throw them, after all. Having them would be useful. He had experienced the power of the Whistling Daggers firsthand.
He took the sheath and, in the process, searched the pockets of the other corpses, finding some Krona as well. Aside from the Whistling Daggers, there was a leather pouch with some unknown powder inside. It gave off a peculiar smell, suggesting it was something that shouldn't be touched carelessly.
If it was a poison that could infect through mere contact, he wouldn't have an antidote on hand. Above all, he disliked using poison, making it a burdensome item in many ways. Enkrid left the poison pouch alone.
It was only natural that the patrol soldiers who found Enkrid later were utterly shocked.
The troublemaker’s squad leader, who had disappeared during his shift, suddenly appeared with five corpses.
“What is this!”
At first, they were so surprised they pointed their spears at him.
“Spies.”
Enkrid briefly explained. It was enough.
“One of them is a familiar face. He claimed to be a peddler's errand boy who arrived four days ago.”
One of the patrol soldiers pointed at the dead man with a crossbow. A peddler is a merchant who travels around carrying a manageable load. It was an appropriate disguise.
“Didn't you check his identification badge?”
“We did, it was very sophisticated.”
A meticulously forged identification badge. Could such things be made frequently?
Unlikely.
Later, one of the soldiers who searched the pockets of the half-elf with the tip of his spear grimaced at the sight of the split head. While Enkrid stood by, the commander of the fourth company, the elf company commander, appeared.
After examining the assassin's body, she spoke.
“He carried poison. He is indeed an assassin.”
She concluded after checking not only the poison but also his physique. Enkrid explained the presence of the assassins without resistance. That was the end of it. Though the patrol soldiers eyed him suspiciously during the entire wait, the misunderstanding was short-lived.
“You took down five? One of them seemed quite skilled.”
“These three are Jack, Bon, and Rot.”
One of the patrol soldiers spoke up, recognizing them. Jack was known for his spear skills, Bon was nimble, and Rot was highly skilled, according to general soldiers. The three of them, a half-elf assassin, and the soldier with the crossbow. Enkrid had dealt with them all without significant injury.
He just had a few scratches.
“...Alone?”
The patrol soldier asked, forgetting the company commander's presence. That’s how shocked he was.
“It just happened that way.”
Enkrid replied, looking at the company commander. The elf company commander said nothing, her expression unchanged. She looked at Enkrid with her unchanging jewel-like green eyes.
“Understood. Return.”
“Yes.”
He saluted and turned to leave. As Enkrid walked away, the elf company commander spoke.
“You left your post, so you will have to make up for it later.”
Such strict words. To consider leaving the post in this situation.
The three patrol soldiers glanced at each other. Enkrid quietly nodded.
“Yes, understood.”
She was his superior. Arguing would be pointless. There are those in the unit who strictly adhere to military law and regulations though the elf company commander didn’t seem to be that type.
But if she said it, a subordinate had to obey. Arguing wouldn't benefit him.
“Alright then.”
Enkrid finally walked away from the scene.
Two days later, two border defense soldiers came to find Enkrid again. Inspecting the scene within the city was the job of the border defense, so they moved for an on-site investigation. Enkrid cooperated sincerely with everything.
“They attacked suddenly.”
“Did you leave your post knowing something?”
“No. They seemed odd, but I just wanted some fresh air.”
“So leaving your post led to discovering the spies? These two seem to have been killed with a single blow?”
“They tried to kill me immediately.”
“And you subdued them without getting injured?”
Their questions were sharper than expected, but Enkrid remained calm. Since he was the only survivor who had seen them, it was natural.
“Yes, I was lucky.”
“Two strokes of luck and you could break down a wall. There must have been a significant skill gap.”
One of them joked, sounding disappointed. They weren’t actually suspicious of Enkrid. It was absurd to suspect the victim of an ambush. Moreover, the border defense had already thoroughly investigated Enkrid when they tried to recruit him into their unit.
“Good work.”
“I heard you got promoted. Congratulations.”
“Yes, thank you.”
Both were of higher rank than him. The ranks of the border defense were originally like that.
“Aren’t you really not considering joining us? Your skills are too good to waste.”
As they were about to leave after the investigation, the short-haired soldier asked.
“No.”
The firm answer silenced him.
“Oh, I see.”
Enkrid returned to his quarters.
As he opened the door, something suddenly fell from above his head on the right. Enkrid instinctively dodged to the side. He ducked low and rolled. Thanks to his quick reaction, only some of his hair was cut.
He barely avoided the attack, wondering what it was.
“Oh, passed the ambush test!”
Rem was smiling slyly. It was Rem’s thrown axe.
“Rem, you crazy bastard.”
It was an act that deserved a curse. Enkrid’s cut hair floated down in the air.
A bit slower and he would have gotten a nasty gash on his neck. A bleeding gash would leave a scar.
“Don't worry. I aimed just to cut a bit of your hair.”
“Forget it.”
The world had many lunatics, but a few particularly crazy ones were in his squad. Enkrid had realized this early on, so he wasn’t even angry.
“With assassins coming after us, we should learn how to deal with ambushes, right?”
“Good excuse.”
Enkrid shook his head.
“Looks like it’s time to cut your hair, isn’t it?”
Rem said, smirking. It was indeed time to trim his hair. His bangs had started to obscure his vision. When he fought the half-elf, he was in a state of heightened concentration and too busy with his tactics to notice.
But now it was becoming a nuisance in everyday life.
“Can you handle it?”
Enkrid asked. Rem didn’t step forward. Instead, Kraiss approached from behind.
“Yes.”
Kraiss was quite skillful with his hands. Others were great with weapons like swords and axes, but when it came to cutting hair, they made a mess.
“I’ll shorten the bangs and trim the rest.”
Kraiss’s tools were a short dagger, scissors, and a horn comb.
“Ten Krona.”
“That’s expensive.”
“I’ve improved. If you don’t like it, go to the city barbershop.”
He didn’t like that. The city barbershop was expensive and worse than Rem with their hands. There was no need to spend twice as much Krona.
Instead, the city barbershop was known for treating wounds, becoming a place for injured soldiers rather than for haircuts.
“Okay, let’s start.”
Snip snip.
The sound of hair being cut reached his ears. He was sitting on a chair placed right in front of the barracks entrance. White snowflakes began to fall from above. Next to him, Rem grumbled.
“Like the devil’s dandruff.”
Clearing the snow would be a headache, keeping them busy in the training ground and the drainage. It was an equal task for everyone. Neither Rem nor Ragna could avoid this labor. If the snow wasn’t cleared, it would cause many problems.
“I hate it.”
Ragna said, having come out with a blanket around his shoulders.
“It is cold.”
Jaxon agreed.
“No matter how much you warm your body, this cold is tough, brother.”
Audin also came out.
Why were they all watching?
Usually, snow made it less cold, but today, the temperature had dropped. Sitting outside made his lips turn blue.
“Ah, my hands are shaking. If I make a mistake, I might cut your ear.”
Kraiss said as he cut the hair.
“I can hear you.”
“That means I’m focused.”
Kraiss warmed his hands with a moderately heated stone and concentrated on cutting hair. Enkrid watched the falling snow, thinking about the spies.
‘How did they get in?’
The one disguised as a peddler forged an identification badge. The half-elf sneaked in secretly. The Border Guard was a city that was difficult to infiltrate. Forging an identification badge was a serious crime. Neither was an easy task.
More than anything, Jack, Bon, and Rot’s switch to spies was odd.
‘Where were they from?’
He seemed to remember something.
“You know the three who died this time?”
Enkrid asked. Kraiss nodded, realizing he was behind Enkrid and couldn’t be seen.
“Yes, I do.”
“Do you know where they were from?”
“Jack was caught pickpocketing and served, and Bon was for insulting a noble.”
“Quite the friend.”
Rem commented at the mention of the noble insult.
“Well said.”
Enkrid laughed at Rem. Rem pretended not to hear, and Kraiss continued.
“Rot used to be a guard for some trading company.”
“Which company?”
“It was a company that went under a while ago, can’t recall the name.”
All three had joined around the same time. Within a year. Kraiss knew a lot, befitting his information dealer status.
‘If someone deliberately planted them.’
Forging identification badges, being familiar with the city's gaps, and having a history with crime. Could there be many such groups? Within the Border Guard, a few obvious ones would come to mind.
The biggest one would be...
‘The Thieves’ Guild.’
Though called a guild, it was a gathering of those involved in various crimes. Didn't they undergo a complete overhaul about a year ago?
He remembered hearing about it somewhere. When he asked Kraiss, he said he had heard such rumors but couldn’t dig deeper. Enkrid's eyes turned to Jaxon.
“Do you know anything about the Thieves’ Guild?”
It was a sudden question. Jaxon quietly looked at Enkrid.
“Why ask me?”
“Just a hunch.”
Enkrid knew how to use his head. Even if there was no clear intention, he could guess Jaxon’s background. A thief or an assassin-related profession.
Or something similar.
So he had to ask. Jaxon remained silent for a moment. Rem was about to say something, but Enkrid stopped him with a look. Ragna stared with his usual half-asleep eyes. Audin quietly clasped his hands, as if waiting for an answer.
Snip snip.
Kraiss broke the silence, cutting the last bit of hair.
“I’d like to know too. You think the assassination attempt on the squad leader started there?”
Kraiss had keen intuition. It made sense to suspect, given the circumstances. Anyone with a brain would.
Kraiss was quick-witted and had experience in the underworld, so he knew a lot. Thus, Kraiss thought Enkrid’s suspicion was valid.
Soon, Jaxon spoke.
Enkrid expected him to ask for something in return, but he didn't.
“It was completely overhauled about a year ago. I don't know anything after that. All connections were cut off.”
It was worth looking into.
Enkrid thought.
“It’s done.”
Kraiss said, and as he finished cutting, the snow began to fall heavily.
“Ah, I really hate this.”
“So do I.”
“Agreed.”
“Brother, it is a trial from God.”
“It’s really annoying.”
Rem, Ragna, Jaxon, Audin, and Kraiss each commented on the falling snow. Enkrid, watching them, spoke.
“I’m thinking of organizing a mission under the squad leader’s authority. Instead of clearing snow, let’s head out immediately.”
At that, the five perked up. Their eyes gleamed like hungry wolves looking at Enkrid. It seemed they would do anything to avoid clearing snow.
“First, I need permission from the company commander.”
Enkrid said, brushing the hair off his face.
“Go on, then.”
“What are you waiting for?”
“It's this way.”
They all urged him to go quickly. Enkrid thought it was best to move while the idea was fresh. Entering the barracks and being pestered by those intense stares wouldn’t be pleasant. Enkrid washed off the hair stuck to his face with the melting snow and headed straight for the company commander's tent.
“You got a haircut. Why are you here? Another ambush?”
Was the ambush comment a joke?
The company commander's words made Enkrid ponder.
“No, that’s not it.”
“Then?”
“I suspect the Thieves’ Guild. I want to confirm.”
The elf company commander had a private tent. She stood with her hands behind her back, looking out at the falling snow through the window.
“Meaning?”
“I want to carry out a mission at my discretion.”
“Hmm.”
The elf company commander looked out the window for a moment before asking.
“Not because you don’t want to clear snow?”
“That’s not it.”
Half of it was true, but the other half was also true. There was nothing to feel guilty about.
“Fine.”
The elf company commander granted permission.
“Be careful. The city's criminal guild is well-connected at the top.”
She raised her right index finger, pointing to the ceiling. The military city had battalion commanders instead of a mayor, but it wasn’t just them. Several nobles were dispatched from the nation for administrative tasks. They were the core power figures in the Border Guard.
“If you make enemies there, it won’t end well.”
Politics from an elf’s mouth sounded awkward, but Enkrid took the advice.
“Yes.”
“When you leave, avoid the torch stands. This is my room. It’d be troublesome if it caught fire.”
The commander's tent had short torch stands, making the air warm.
“Yes, I’ll be careful.”
Even as he answered, Enkrid thought he couldn’t get used to the elf's jokes.
Chapter 62: A Knight Must Never Harbor Shame in His Heart
"Wait here for a moment. I'll send someone over."
Just because he got permission didn't mean they could leave immediately. When he returned to the quarters, the squad members were waiting like baby birds for their mother bird.
"Get ready."
With one word, the situation was conveyed.
"Oh, I knew it. The squad leader always pulls through!"
"Excellent."
Rem and Jaxon each made a remark, and the others began to move as well. They needed to at least gather some equipment.
"For now, wait. Orders will come soon."
"Alright."
No matter what he said now, it would be taken well. It was rare to see the entire squad united like this. Even when Ragna and Rem bumped into each other while moving, they just passed by without a word, not even a single snide comment.
"You sly alley cat, got any spare cloaks? It's bloody cold."
Rem particularly hated the cold. Jaxon shook his head at Rem's words. Normally, this would have led to a fight, but it passed smoothly.
‘They’re getting along.’
How nice it would be if they could always step back and live like this. Of course, it was just wishful thinking. Watching the busy squad members, Enkrid sat on his bed.
Soon, someone sent by the company commander arrived.
"What did you do to get the entire squad assigned to this mission?"
It was the fourth platoon leader, a messenger from the company commander.
"We're going to track the lead on the assassins. The Thieves’ Guild."
"...Be careful. Even a knight's grandfather can't dodge a dagger from behind. Thieves are dangerous."
The platoon leader gave a word of caution with an old proverb.
A dagger to the back.
Once upon a time, a general who ruled the continent was killed by a dagger from a subordinate he trusted deeply. It’s an old tale, not quite a legend but not really history either. Whether it actually happened is unknown.
As Enkrid nodded in understanding,
"No, a knight can dodge it."
Ragna spoke.
"Even if you're not a knight, you can dodge it."
Jaxon agreed.
"If you get stabbed in the back without putting up a fight, you're an idiot."
Rem concluded.
No sooner had the platoon leader finished speaking than the three of them jumped in.
"Forget it."
The platoon leader shook his head and left. Permission was granted, after all.
"Let's go."
Enkrid stood up and said. The weather was colder than the day before, making the quarters feel like an icebox.
As for equipment, Rem only had his hand axe. Ragna had the arming sword he exchanged with Enkrid before. Jaxon only had a sword that looked like a short sword. Audin carried two short, oil-soaked clubs at his waist.
"Stealing is bad. Let's go teach them a lesson."
Audin said, stepping forward. Rem chuckled at his words.
"Right. Stealing is bad."
Though their equipment was simple, Jaxon was bundled up in thick fur clothes, making him look sluggish. Ragna wore a patched-up, tattered cloak that even a passing beggar wouldn't want.
The most ridiculous was Rem.
"Are you going like that?"
Jaxon’s outfit was permissible, and Ragna's could be excused as well.
But this?
Rem had wrapped himself entirely in a blanket. He looked like a walking bed. He didn’t seem to intend to use his arms. Only his toes peeked out.
"I hate the cold."
Would reasoning work?
Enkrid chose efficiency. He ignored Rem.
"Let's go."
The Troublemaker Squad headed to the market.
"It might be dangerous."
Kraiss muttered to himself as he followed. He chose the risk of danger over shoveling snow until his arms swelled. He really hated shoveling snow.
Enkrid had a habit of endlessly reflecting on and reviewing fights after they ended. It was his way of surviving. This time was no different. The half-elf had used the whistling daggers and Rot to divert his attention.
‘A trick.’
A simple yet effective distraction. The goal was close combat. With one move, a decisive strike, the fight was to end. For some reason, the half-elf was a fan of aiming for the heart. This allowed him to predict the target area and, through repeated encounters, he had experienced the weapon’s form. He could calculate and fight accordingly.
‘If I had failed?’
Enkrid wondered.
‘Was I relying on luck?’
The half-elf might not have acted as he had calculated. That things went according to plan required some degree of luck. Enkrid questioned himself. On the first day, when he killed the stabbing freak.
Enkrid had relied on his full-strength thrust as his weapon. Not considering what would happen next, it was akin to gambling his life. Reflecting on that time, he recalled his mistake.
Had he made the same mistake this time?
This time, he hadn’t.
‘Even if I had used a different move.’
In the end, he would have still won. He was confident in his superior tactics and his prior skill. Even if the half-elf had fought seriously and Rot had remained behind him.
‘I would still have the upper hand.’
It wouldn’t have been as clean, and he might have gotten injured, but, reflecting, he repeated this process countless times.
While walking, he visualized different scenarios.
The patrol soldier who found Enkrid was surprised twice. First, at the sight of the corpses, and second, at seeing the troublesome squad leader who had become a high-ranking soldier.
A high-ranking soldier in name.
How many regular soldiers had displayed such skill?
Especially considering his previous lack of skill.
In conclusion, he was now recognized by others as no longer scraping the bottom in terms of swordsmanship. Yet, Enkrid pondered.
‘There might have been an easier way.’
His attitude made it hard to believe he had repeated the same day. Perhaps it was this attitude that allowed him to face each new day. As his thoughts wandered, Enkrid recalled his dream from the previous night.
‘Is there nothing else to do?’
The existence of the ferryman on the Black River was inexplicable. In the dream, the ferryman hadn’t mocked him as before. He simply stared and then spoke.
“What are you?”
A voice without a mouth. The emotion in the voice was conveyed clearly. Enkrid instinctively felt that the ferryman had intended to convey that emotion. It was curiosity, pure and untainted by disappointment, anger, or any other feeling.
He couldn't answer. It was just a dream, after all. Though it wasn't a normal dream.
"Squad Leader."
Enkrid stopped walking only when someone grabbed his arm from behind.
"Sorry, what did you say?"
He had been so lost in thought that he hadn't heard what was said to him.
"I said, with that mindset, you're bound to get stabbed by a thief."
Rem said. It hadn’t seemed like a long speech. Most of all, Rem himself looked like he’d get stabbed and die wrapped up in that blanket if they went in now. Ignoring Rem, Jaxon spoke.
"Do you have a plan?"
A plan? What plan?
Enkrid felt the same curiosity he had felt in the dream with the ferryman.
"Are you thinking of storming the Thieves’ Guild without any information? Do you even know where their headquarters is?"
Jaxon asked, crossing his arms. His thick clothes made his elbows look funny, but Jaxon didn’t mind.
The Thieves’ Guild involved in pickpocketing, human trafficking, and other crimes.
Its name was Gielpin.
Commonly known as the Thieves’ Guild, it was essentially a crime organization. Would such people openly reveal their headquarters and activities?
No. They hid like parasites in the city's shadows and back alleys.
"I don’t know."
"You need to plan first."
"Were you really going to go without any idea?"
Rem asked, joining the conversation. Ragna kept quiet, blowing warm breath into the cold air. Audin just smiled.
"Did you really not think about it?"
Kraiss asked with his big eyes fixed on Enkrid.
"I thought you would know their headquarters."
"No matter how much I know, how would I know the Guild’s location? Trying to find out would get me killed."
Kraiss mimicked a throat-cutting gesture with his hand.
Would a crime guild kill a standing army? Did they have that much power? Would they really do such a thing?
Actually, he hadn't cared. He had no time or energy to spare for such concerns.
"Have you never carried out a small-scale operation?"
Jaxon asked again, seeming to reprimand Enkrid for leading the squad without a proper plan. Enkrid was at a loss for words.
What had his life been like so far?
He had been too busy trying to survive. He spent his days carving out time to swing his sword one more time. He hadn’t had time to learn about strategy. Though he had experience as a mercenary. He had served as a squad leader.
He had participated in small operations multiple times but the flow of battle and small operations outside were entirely different. In battle, leading a small reconnaissance squad was familiar territory, but this was different.
Moreover.
‘That was.’
It was a result of desperate thinking for survival, not moving based on meticulous strategy. All of it was learned at the cost of lives.
Should he do the same now?
Should he throw himself into the cycle of death and repetition again?
Enkrid stopped walking. The biting cold wind penetrated his cloak and brushed his side. A chilling wind.
‘I don’t want to do that.’
He didn’t want to use repeating the day as a method. The pain of death wasn’t something he welcomed. Moreover, his instinct told him it wasn’t necessary.
Then what should he do?
He hadn’t come without any thought. He had considered a common approach.
"Can't we find out by asking around? No matter how well they hide, the locals know everything."
There are no secrets in this world. Secrets are completed by death. When the only person who knows the secret dies, no one else can learn it. A crime organization couldn’t hide itself completely.
Therefore, someone knew.
"That won’t work. The Gielpin are known for cutting off loose ends and being terrifying. Even if you grab a low-ranking member and grill them, they wouldn’t know anything. And if they slip up and talk, Gielpin would break all their limbs and cut their tongue."
They controlled their organization through fear of retaliation.
So how?
He couldn’t think of an immediate method. He could always struggle to survive and think about it. If this were a battlefield, he would know how to hold his position strategically.
But this wasn’t such a situation.
"Squad Leader, give us orders."
Lost in thought, Ragna spoke, looking up at the sky and exhaling. Enkrid's eyes turned to Ragna. With a sword in hand, he had few equals in swordsmanship.
Enkrid's view of Ragna. Usually, Ragna was lazy and careless. He often got lost and dropped things from his pockets. But sometimes, just sometimes, Ragna could hit the mark perfectly. As if he held a sword.
"The leader just needs to give orders. Let those who know how to carry them out do the rest."
That one line. Ragna's softly spoken words were heavy and significant to Enkrid. He was the leader. That was his role.
Squad Leader, the head of the squad.
Had Enkrid been leading the squad until now?
‘Was I the squad leader?’
No. It was difficult for someone with poor skills, busy surviving, to lead a group. Especially when each squad member was highly skilled. But Ragna's words changed the situation.
"Alright."
Rem acknowledged. Jaxon nodded slightly.
"That’s right. Brother, that's how leaders do it."
Audin agreed.
"It’s true, but why?"
Only Kraiss seemed out of place. He had always considered Enkrid his leader in his heart.
"True. You’re right. Jaxon, do you have a way?"
Jaxon, known for equivalent exchange, also dealt in information. Kraiss's information was shallow and wide, while Jaxon's was narrow and deep.
"I do."
"Tell me."
"Get an inn in the market and wait. I'll be back before sundown."
Instead of explaining, he said he’d leave.
"Trust me to find out."
"Fine. Let's go to the inn."
Once decided, there was no looking back. Enkrid did just that. On the way to the inn, though not yet in the heart of the market, there weren’t many people around, but on the well-trodden dirt path, Enkrid spoke his thoughts.
"We’ll find the guild's headquarters and wipe it out."
The opponent was a crime organization. Even if they had no evidence, using force to crush them wouldn’t raise many objections. Though it might put holes in the nobles’ and battalion commander’s pockets.
‘What does that matter?’
A knight must never harbor shame in his heart. Just as he saw, heard, learned, and dreamed as a child. Enkrid had lived that way.
He intended to continue doing so.
Chapter 63: Knock
It was quick, just as one would expect of Jaxon. They had entered the inn around noon, and Jaxon returned before dusk had even fully set in.
“That was fast.”
Rem, patting his full stomach after a meal of pumpkin soup and well-cooked pork ham, commented as if mocking their hasty eater. Ignoring Rem, Jaxon looked at Enkrid and said, “I'll guide you.”
He was ready to depart immediately.
“Sit down.”
Enkrid, still seated, commanded. Jaxon hesitated. Even though they had found the location, if too much time passed, their lead might be discovered. Their target could hide or prepare to cut off any traces cleanly.
Could they be risking unnecessary danger?
If he were alone, and if it was his decision to make and execute, these wouldn't be concerns.
Jaxon had many thoughts running through his head, but the squad leader’s voice broke through.
"The pumpkin soup here is delicious."
Who didn't know that?
The inn's name was "Vanessa's Pumpkin Soup." It was one of four inns at the market crossroads, known for its good food.
“Kraiss paid out of his own pocket. Let's eat before we go.”
Only after Enkrid repeated himself did Jaxon sit. For some reason, Rem, Ragna, and Audin didn’t say anything either. Jaxon brushed the snow off his shoulders and head.
Thanks to the warmth of the fireplace, the snow melted quickly. As a result, his outerwear got a bit damp. It wasn’t enough to be bothersome.
"Here, one order of pumpkin soup and the barbecue we had earlier."
“The companion you were waiting for has arrived! Coming right up!”
The waitress responded cheerfully. She was a lively one. Most of the soldiers liked the Pumpkin Soup Inn. Good food does that.
Though it might be a pity for those who handled cooking in the unit, Ragna often said that the food in the unit was like torturing his mouth. Sometimes it was edible, but mostly not. In contrast, the meals at Vanessa's Pumpkin Soup Inn were excellent.
There was a rumor that the best chef in Border Guard worked here.
“Delaying isn't good.”
Jaxon spoke as he sat. Enkrid nodded and answered.
“It’s still snowing.”
Did Enkrid want to do hard labor?
Not unless it was sword training or martial arts training. To him, snow was the devil’s dandruff. In fact, everyone in the unit felt the same. If they attacked the Thieves' Guild and returned, the accumulated snow would be waiting for them.
That was why Rem and the others had kept quiet. It was also why Kraiss had opened his purse. Jaxon understood everything.
“I see.”
After that, he focused on eating. By the time twilight fully settled, everyone, including Enkrid, got up from their seats.
“Let’s go.”
“Come again!”
The lively waitress said. Kraiss gave a slight nod. They seemed to know each other. They had often been seen whispering together while staying at the inn.
“Do you know her?”
Enkrid asked.
“Her name is Leysa, seventeen years old, father is a shoemaker, and mother is a weaver. Neither has ever joined a guild.”
A shoemaker is someone who makes shoes from leather or other materials. A weaver is someone who weaves cloth. Both were common professions. There were crafting guilds and woodworking guilds in the city, but if they hadn't joined a guild, their skills probably weren’t outstanding.
“Her dream is to someday open an inn in the capital. For now, her goal is to learn the culinary skills at Vanessa’s Pumpkin Soup.”
“She has big dreams.”
Rem interjected, making a comment. It was understandable. Running an inn was no easy task. Not just anyone could do it. Besides the Krona required, it was also essential to have armed guards. Selling alcohol and food often led to trouble.
Today was quiet because of the snow, but on a normal day, there would likely be some scuffles. Even as they were leaving, the armed guard had glanced their way.
Enkrid thought he looked like a retired soldier. Having an armed guard from the Border Guard would be convenient in many ways. They could handle minor disturbances discreetly. If something bigger happened, the guard alone couldn't handle it, and they would need to call the unit guards. Having connections in the unit meant they could call for guards more quickly.
For these reasons, hiring retired soldiers as guards was essential in Border Guard.
Moreover, inns were heavily taxed, and in Border Guard, they needed to have halls for meetings, special rooms, private training rooms, dining areas, and taverns. Since Border Guard had no lord and no lord’s manor, all major and minor events happened at the inns. Although there were meeting rooms in the unit, they were military facilities. Not just anyone could enter.
Naturally, inns developed out of necessity. Setting up such an inn in the capital seemed far-fetched, but it wasn’t a reason to give up.
“You know a lot.”
Enkrid said, walking behind Jaxon.
“Pretty women are all potential future clients.”
Kraiss's goal was to open a salon for noblewomen. A salon exclusively for women. Naturally, all the attendants would be handsome men.
He had a creative mind. He planned to make money by using men’s looks to empty noblewomen’s purses. Kraiss, seemingly anxious, kept talking.
“But is the Panther okay? Isn’t it cold? Why doesn’t it move when I tell it to follow?”
“Are you still after its claws?”
“No. I realized I might not survive if I did. It wasn’t expensive for nothing.”
Enkrid chuckled at Kraiss’s words. He didn’t believe Kraiss had given up.
“Why don’t you name it? Looks like we’ll be keeping it around.”
At Kraiss's suggestion, Enkrid nodded to himself. They couldn't keep calling it ‘the panther’ indefinitely. As they talked, they found themselves in a dark alleyway. They had turned several corners, and even Enkrid, with his good sense of direction, was getting confused.
“Are you sure you’re not taking us into a trap after getting paid off by the Thieves' Guild?”
Rem teased. Jaxon ignored him.
“This guy always ignores me.”
Rem grumbled, but Jaxon’s consistent response was to ignore him.
“Enough.”
Enkrid stopped Rem from saying more.
“You're playing favorites? If I get upset, it won’t be fun.”
It was a good sign if Rem was venting at Enkrid. It meant he intended to end the argument here. After that, it was quiet. Ragna, seemingly bored, kicked the ground as he walked.
“Winter is cold.”
Audin’s only comment was about a group of beggars lying on the ground despite the cold. The snow had stopped, but a thin layer covered the hard, frozen ground. By the next day, the sun would melt it, turning the ground into a slushy mess.
“Here we are.”
After wandering through alleyways for about half an hour, they came upon an old wooden door. It was a door commonly seen throughout Border Guard. The sun had set, but the moonlight provided enough visibility. As Enkrid reached to push the door open,
“Do you want the left side?”
Rem, standing still with the moonlight behind him, asked.
“I’ll take the right side. I should repay the meal.”
Audin responded.
“Do whatever you want. As long as no one comes at me.”
Ragna yawned.
“You lazy bastard. Squad Leader, we’ve got company.”
Enkrid turned at Rem’s words. They were all dressed in rags. Upon closer inspection, they were the beggars they had seen earlier. The image of the half-elf assassin flickered in his mind and then disappeared.
‘Twice the size.’
Enkrid unconsciously brushed his hand against the back of his belt. His fingers found a knife. It wasn't a common item. He had taken it from the half-elf assassin’s corpse. He also had the sheath of whistling daggers strapped to his chest. Those whistling daggers weren’t easy to come by.
So, naturally, he kept them. He had gathered the ones stuck in the ground and those on the elf’s body.
“Didn't you learn not to come to places like this after dark?”
One of the beggars spoke, showing teeth so yellow they seemed black.
In the dark, details weren’t clear. Despite the winter and being several steps away, the stench was noticeable.
“Bullshit.”
Rem replied and moved. It wasn’t a quick movement. He just walked briskly, closing the distance. The beggar drew a pocket knife from his sleeve. A knife with a blade less than a handspan long. He made a stabbing gesture with it.
“You're dead.”
Those were his last words. Rem didn’t stop walking, and the beggar thrust his knife. The beggar aimed for the stomach, but Rem grabbed his wrist with his left hand. Rem pulled the beggar inward and struck his head with his right elbow.
Crack!
It was a decisive blow. The beggar’s neck twisted at an unnatural angle from the elbow strike. Simultaneously, on the other side, Audin used his thumb, index, and middle fingers to twist a beggar's jaw.
With just three fingers, he twisted the jaw, breaking the neck. It was an impressive display of brute strength.
“Crazy bastard!”
“Shit!”
Two of the remaining three beggars shouted, while the other tried to slip away. The fight with Rem and Audin was brief. They closed the distance, ignored the knives, and delivered a single blow.
Rem struck one beggar’s throat with a chop and his temple with a fist. The beggar lost consciousness.
Audin was even simpler. He stepped forward with his left foot and threw a straight punch with his left hand.
Boom!
The punch was like a cannon. The twisting force from his foot and waist culminated in the punch. The beggar’s nose vanished, his face caving in as he collapsed to his knees and then to the ground. A single blow had crushed his face. Knocking him out was inevitable. Meanwhile, the beggar who tried to flee was dealt with by Enkrid.
Thunk!
“Ugh!”
The beggar, running away, fell forward with a dagger in his neck. Rem, who had just been about to give chase, turned his head. Audin blinked a few times, and Ragna, who had been half-asleep, opened his eyes wide. Jaxon’s frown relaxed.
In the heavy, cold air,
“Wow.”
Kraiss let out a short exclamation.
Enkrid lowered his right hand, still in a throwing stance, and said.
“Why waste time chasing?”
“When did our squad leader get so good at throwing knives?”
Rem asked.
“I got better with practice.”
“That’s quite something.”
“Is this really the time to be admiring my knife throwing?”
Rem nodded, acknowledging the truth in his words. Not a single person was surprised that five beggars had attacked them. Even Kraiss remained unphased.
“Aren’t you surprised?”
Enkrid asked. He had seen the beggars’ postures and hands as they approached. It wasn’t for nothing that he survived as a mercenary. To survive with mediocre skills, you needed keen perception. Enkrid's perception was exceptional. He understood that if there were guards, there was something to protect ahead.
“No, I wasn’t surprised. What type of beggars would attack armed soldiers? Their excuse was weak. It's certain this is either the headquarters of the thieve’s guild or they’re hiding something.”
Was it something anyone could notice?
Or was Kraiss just smart?
Probably the former. But he was still bold. Even though he tended to run around in battle, Kraiss had seen combat up close.
This was nothing to him.
“It’s surprising for a gang.”
“What is?”
“The way they behaved, it looked like they were rotating shifts. For a simple gang, it’s quite meticulous. That Gielpin guy must be very competent.”
Kraiss was indeed clever. He could see the whole picture from a single aspect.
“That’s true.”
While they exchanged a few words, Jaxon opened the door and stepped back. Seeing him grip his sword, he seemed ready to cut it down. Audin stepped in.
“I’ll knock.”
It was the headquarters of a crime organization. Knocking wouldn’t get them in.
Bang!
But Audin’s knock was different.
“Haha, well done, our pious friend.”
Rem admired. Enkrid was also impressed. Audin had twisted his body, using his left foot as a pivot, and slammed the door with his palm. He immediately withdrew his hand. It was a sharp strike.
The door hinges lifted, and the door collapsed inward. It was open. In other words, he had broken it down.
It was a bold knock.
Chapter 64: One Strike
After the door opened, Rem was the first to step inside.
“Who’s there...?”
He said something as he entered, but he had no time. Something fell from above Rem’s head. Anticipating the attack, Rem swung his axe vertically. A flash of light cut through the darkness of the room. Rem, having swung his axe, immediately threw himself to the side. Everything flowed smoothly, as if prearranged.
Thunk.
The fallen corpse was the only indication of what had happened.
“What the hell?”
Kraiss, peeking in, was startled.
The assailant had been hiding above, gripping short knives in both hands. Rem's axe had split him from chest to groin, spilling his guts and blood onto the floor. The stench of blood and death filled the air.
“I thought they were just a lowly crime guild.”
Kraiss murmured.
“These bastards.”
Rem twisted his lips into a grin.
“How cute.”
With that, he stepped further inside. The interior was quite spacious, with a right-angled corridor made of neatly laid bricks, dirt, and straw. Rem advanced boldly.
“Is it you?”
Without hesitation, he swung his axe again. A second corpse fell. Another thug had been hiding beside the corridor. He had tried to stab Rem with a skewer, but it was futile.
Rem’s axe was faster. Their opponent was a crime guild which included pickpockets and extortionists. Meanwhile, they were soldiers whose job was combat. Moreover, Enkrid himself was a high-ranking soldier, and the others fought even better than he did.
‘I expected us to have the advantage.’
Seeing it with his own eyes was something else. The criminals hid in the shadows, stabbing with knives, but despite their skill, Rem crushed every ambush. He didn't seem crazed but exhibited a quiet madness. A madness that promised to split anyone who approached with his axe.
Rem continued, never stopping his mouth.
“Or is it you?”
He asked every time he killed someone.
“Is it you?”
Slash!
“Is it you?”
By the fifth ambusher, he had split the head and asked.
“Dead men can't talk.”
Enkrid commented from behind. Rem, with his axe dripping blood, scratched his head with the handle.
“I know, but even the living aren’t answering.”
The answers would be with someone else. Passing the right-angled corridor, they found a room to the left, another to the right, and a reception area straight ahead. It wasn’t a complex structure. A reception area, two rooms, a pantry, and a kitchen. That was all.
And five dead ambushers. None of them spoke.
“This is absurd for a crime organization. They must be the ones who targeted the squad leader.”
Kraiss, examining the dead bodies, remarked. After studying one face for a while, he looked up.
“I don’t recognize them.”
Enkrid nodded, agreeing both that he didn’t recognize them and that they likely were the ones who targeted him.
‘Lucky or unlucky?’
To be honest, half of it was an excuse to avoid the devil’s dandruff. He knew the crime guild was adept at forging identification badges and guiding assassins.
‘But targeting professional soldiers in Border Guard?’
It was a risky move in this city. Yet, they did it. They must have had their reasons. But those reasons didn’t concern Enkrid. They had come here on a hunch. It was like shooting an arrow and hitting a boar between the eyes.
“Is this it?”
Rem said, looking around. There were no answers, only five dead men who had tried to stab them. The chaos had been ended by one rampaging Rem.
“Can't be. With their preparation and Jaxon’s intel, there must be more.”
Kraiss said, pulling out a flint from his pocket. It was dark, so he gathered some straw from the floor and lit it. With a spark from the flint, the straw caught fire. The cold air inside the house was warmed by the firelight.
Using the straw torch, Kraiss thoroughly searched the surroundings. Then he stomped on one spot in the reception room with his heel.
Thunk.
A hollow sound. The floor was empty beneath.
“I’ll handle it.”
Audin stepped forward. A cheap fur rug covered the floor, with a chair on top. He grabbed the edge of the rug and yanked it aside. The chair thudded heavily. Then Audin knocked again.
Bang.
In a sitting position, he drove his fist vertically into the wooden floor, creating a hole. Through the hole, Audin reached in and unlocked the latch.
“Where does this lead?”
“The headquarters.”
Jaxon answered Kraiss’s question, as if expecting this. Rem looked at Enkrid. The burning straw torch made Rem’s normally grey eyes appear red.
“Keep going.”
Enkrid spoke before Rem could ask. Once started, they had to finish. They weren’t dealing with a small gang but a large group significant enough to be called a guild. If these were the ones who targeted him, they had to be dealt with. No fool would let someone who tried to kill them live. Fortunately, Enkrid wasn’t a fool.
“Of course!”
Rem led the way. The tunnel wasn’t long. In less than half an hour, they saw a passage leading upwards. Despite the cold, Rem had discarded his blanket when they encountered the beggars. Watching Rem shiver, Enkrid sensed anger emanating from his back.
“Someone’s up there.”
Jaxon, walking right behind Rem, said. There were guards.
“They’re expecting us.”
Kraiss, at the rear, commented.
“Can’t let thieves run rampant in the city.”
Audin stepped forward again. He seemed to have a knack for breaking doors. Maybe it was his hobby. He climbed the poorly made dirt steps two at a time and twisted his body, ramming his shoulder into the door. It was a unique technique. Enkrid's eyes sparkled watching it.
Bang!
It sounded like an explosion, or a fire spell going off. The door flew upwards.
“Whoa!”
The surprised exclamations of the waiting guards were heard. Then it was Rem’s turn again.
“Is it you?”
He leaped up yet again with with his mysterious question. He stepped on the stairs with his first step and on Audin’s thigh with his second, flying into the air and swinging his axe. Enkrid, from below, saw only Rem’s butt.
But the result was clear. Thumping sounds and blood flowing down the hole’s edge told the story.
“That brother has no manners, stepping on someone’s thigh.”
Audin dusted off his thigh and climbed up first, followed by Jaxon and Ragna, then Enkrid and Kraiss.
Fwoosh.
Torches lit up all around them.
“Who are these crazy bastards?”
Voices were heard. Enkrid looked around. At least thirty men stood around, each holding a weapon. There were spiked clubs, short swords, spears, and blackjacks— leather pouches filled with sand. They were heavily armed.
Thanks to the torches, visibility was good. Kraiss threw the straw torch into the hole and admired the sight.
“Wow, that’s a lot.”
Yeah, it was a lot.
Enkrid thought the same.
“You’re soldiers, right?”
Among the thirty men, one stood out, dressed in fine silk shirt and trousers, with a coat made of monster leather. He leaned on a cane. It wasn’t a cane for walking.
A jeweled cane, a symbol of wealth carried by nobles or wealthy merchants. Why would someone with perfectly good legs need a cane? It was a symbol of arrogance.
“Is this the Gielpin gang?”
Enkrid answered the question with a question. The aristocratic-looking man frowned, clearly offended.
“Why does everyone want to die?”
“We came to ask about the ambush in Border Guard.”
Before Enkrid finished speaking, Rem interrupted.
“Is it you?”
Short, but sharp.
He was asking about the ambush on himself. Would they answer such a question?
It suited Rem’s style.
‘I wouldn’t answer either.’
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
The man was not only unperturbed but also brazen. His confidence was suspicious. Enkrid’s squad members needed no more than suspicion.
“It’s him.”
Jaxon muttered.
“Hmm, so it was him.”
Ragna stared at the man with the cane. Given Ragna’s usual demeanor, this was an intense glare. He was fully opening his eyes to stare at him. Usually, Ragna kept his eyes half-closed.
“Brother, did you really target our squad leader?”
Audin stepped forward and asked. A few men nearby flinched. The torchlight cast shadows, making Audin look even larger. Enkrid was nearly 180 cm tall, but Audin was a hand taller. Almost 2 meters tall. Not just tall. Up close, his entire body was muscle. His arm thickness surpassed most women's thighs.
All of Enkrid's squad members were solidly built, muscular men. Even Kraiss had sculpted abs to show off to the women he met.
But Audin was overwhelmingly imposing. If muscle size symbolized masculinity, Audin might be one of the most masculine men on the continent.
“Is it true, brother?”
“What nonsense is this about sending an assassin to kill a mere soldier?”
The man blurted out more than necessary after seeing Audin’s physique.
“We never mentioned an assassin.”
Enkrid had only said ambush, not assassination. Hearing Enkrid, the aristocratic-looking man’s expression grew calm.
“So what?”
What now?
They were over thirty armed criminals. Fully prepared. They knew Enkrid's group was coming. Somewhere, information had leaked.
But did it change anything?
No.
At least, Enkrid thought so. The same went for the crime. There was no proof. So whether they admitted it or not didn’t matter.
Nothing changed. That was true for both sides. Evidence wasn’t needed to eradicate a crime organization.
So, what now?
Even among criminals, some might have grabbed weapons reluctantly.
Should they kill them all?
Enkrid had no such intention. So he decided to give them a chance.
Shing.
He drew his longsword and drew a line in the dirt. A few flinched at the drawn sword but didn’t attack. A line formed in the frozen ground. The line wasn’t clearly visible in the torchlight, but the message was clear.
A short line in the middle of the open space. Enkrid pressed the tip of his sword against the line and spoke.
“Anyone who has never killed an innocent, who will go to jail quietly, or who doesn’t want to die, drop your weapons and cross the line.”
This wasn’t a battlefield. Even criminals didn’t deserve a one-sided slaughter. The enemies might not know it, but Enkrid did, so he offered them a chance.
“Think carefully or you’ll all die today.”
He spoke of slaughter. It was a world where death and killing weren’t strange, but killing was never enjoyable.
If this were a battlefield, if it were to survive, then it couldn’t be helped, but this wasn’t such a time.
That’s why he offered a chance.
“What’s he saying?”
“Huh? Who’s dying?”
“Is he so scared he’s lost his mind?”
“Hey, friend. Did you piss yourself?”
The criminals laughed at Enkrid. One even twirled his finger beside his ear. No one crossed the line Enkrid drew.
“What are you doing?”
Rem asked. Enkrid wasn’t ashamed. He had intended to give them a chance from the start.
“Brother, their eyes are blinded by the devil. They won't believe unless they see.”
Audin whispered. Killing them all would be unwise. Enkrid chose the next method.
“Who’s the best swordsman here?”
He would widen their options by showing his skill. Unlike before, he was now confident. He could beat most opponents. Enkrid stepped forward with his drawn sword.
“Fight him.”
The guild leader chuckled, as if watching a show. Enkrid’s opponent stepped forward.
“You’re quite cocky, huh?”
He looked like a mercenary. His beard made his age hard to guess. He didn’t seem over forty.
“You’re gonna die. Better....”
A Vallen-style mercenary sword.
Hitting mid-sentence. That was his tactic. It reminded Enkrid of his past self. The opponent thrust his spear mid-sentence.
The spear thrust was skillful but not as fast as the first twisted soldier’s thrust. Or as deadly as Mitch Hurrier’s stab.
Enkrid dodged the spear and closed in, lifting his sword.
A thrust from below.
Thunk!
One strike.
The fight was over in one move. The opponent was at Enkrid’s former level. Enkrid realized his growth.
‘This level.’
He didn’t need to repeat the day. He saw the opponent’s level at a glance. The one-strike fight ended quickly. The man, pierced by the sword, bled out. Enkrid pushed him aside.
Pulling out his sword, the body trembled and hot blood spilled onto the cold ground. Silence fell with the cold air. One sword strike was enough to make an impression.
The criminals’ eyes on Enkrid changed. Enkrid asked again.
“Who wants to cross the line?”
Chapter 65: Those Who Cross Over
‘He predicted the enemy's actions.’
Jaxon attributed it to the efficiency of the blade's technique he had taught. Seeing it put to such effective use made him feel a warm satisfaction. It pleased him greatly.
However, Jaxon didn't acknowledge his feelings. He wasn't used to introspection and didn't know how to process his emotions.
‘It's nothing significant.’
People dying before his eyes was merely an annoyance. Why should he care about Enkrid's welfare?
It meant nothing. Or so he thought. Jaxon believed playing soldier was trivial. His goals were clear. Yet, he still felt uneasy. Because of this, Jaxon kept his eyes on the guild leader behind Enkrid.
‘I don’t like his face.’
Jaxon found an excuse.
It wasn't about the squad leader. He simply didn’t like the guy’s face. So, if he attacked, Jaxon would kill him. Here, he would be dutiful. Rem had seen Enkrid’s beastly heart wielded as a weapon of audacity.
To see him charging into the enemy’s range of a thrusting spear... A few months ago, he wouldn't have imagined the squad leader acting this way. At some point, his skills had dramatically improved, centered on Rem’s teachings.
‘Of course.’
It pleased him but assassins had targeted Enkrid.
‘We should kill them all.’
Rem wanted to obliterate them. Ragna saw traces of himself in Enkrid's swordsmanship.
‘Where did he learn it?’
It was excellent. The way he shifted his center of gravity, the way he lifted his feet, the way he thrust his sword— everything. Even though he occasionally helped with swordsmanship, to be this skilled required excruciating training.
‘Fascinating.’
Someone he thought lacked talent suddenly displayed great skill. Ragna had always liked Enkrid. His relentless perseverance inspired Ragna.
Assassins and criminals had targeted such a man?
‘It’s easier to kill them all.’
Forgetting his usual laziness, Ragna decided to annihilate the crime guild. However, the command was Enkrid’s. He would follow his lead.
Audin examined Enkrid's body with his eyes, tapping his own thigh.
‘A well-trained body.’
But it wasn't a systematically built body. The monks of the temple build the body before honing skills. It was a secret technique of physical training. Audin had refined it into his own method.
‘If he builds his body, he’ll improve.’
The squad leader was a man who knew how to work diligently. Audin's mind wandered.
Why didn’t God grant talent to such a hardworking man?
‘A mere human cannot fathom God’s intentions.’
It was a thorny thought for him, causing a sharp pain in his heart. Yet before him was a man who overcame the wall of talent through effort. A man who believed only in himself, disregarding God’s will.
‘My Lord.’
Audin prayed silently.
‘Watch over him. May the one who dreams of shining not die in vain by a blind blade.’
Just like his heartfelt prayer, he didn’t appreciate someone targeting Enkrid. A man like that dying from a stab in the back would be a terrible waste.
However, Audin had no intention of killing anyone.
‘Break both legs and let the leader take an arm.’
So, he would take everything except their lives.
A single strike.
The shock Enkrid delivered was significant. Yet no one crossed the line.
‘It's not enough.’
To overwhelm them with force, he needed to deliver continuous shocks. Enkrid realized his position. He didn’t always have to step forward himself.
“Rem.”
“Yes?”
“Kill three.”
Using the excuse of avoiding the devil's dandruff, this was both a strategy and a mission, and Enkrid was the squad leader. Rem stepped forward without hesitation. The shock Enkrid delivered had not yet faded.
Rem twirled his two hand axes and ran. He moved so quickly that he seemed to vanish. Rem appeared in front of a thug with a vicious look and a spiked club. It was a familiar sight. Rem’s arm whipped like a lash. The axe blade at the end of the lash flashed.
Wham! Thud!
Whack!
The first axe stroke severed the thug’s neck. The second split the head of the thug to his right. The last strike swung left, the axe handle striking another thug’s neck.
Three thugs were killed in quick succession— one beheaded, one split open, and one with a broken neck. Afterward, Rem swung his axes diagonally to shake off the blood. Blood droplets scattered on the floor. Then he turned his back on the thugs and walked back.
“Killed three.”
Enkrid believed two shocks were enough to give them a chance.
“Those who want to cross over.”
It was the third time he made the same offer. If they didn’t heed it now, there was no choice. He couldn’t show mercy to those trying to kill him. It was a time of kill or be killed. They should know that if they tried to kill, they could die.
“Are you from Border Guard?”
The aristocratic-looking guild leader asked.
“No.”
Enkrid led only a small squad, albeit a unique one.
“We’re infantry from the Cyprus Brigade of the Border Guard.”
He loosely gripped his sword and stated his affiliation. There was no reason to hide it. A few who were hesitating to put down their weapons froze under the guild leader’s fierce glare.
“Try to survive, and I’ll see if I let you.”
He was speaking to his own men. Kraiss's earlier words came to mind. Gielpin ruled through fear. If they defied him, he would break their limbs and cut out their tongues.
“Don’t be swayed! They’re just men. Stab them, and they die. They aren’t even properly armored! Kill them! No one survives a mob beating!”
Enkrid thought it was a reasonable tactic. Crushing with numbers. It was generally effective. Trained soldiers were most efficient in group combat. In smaller skirmishes, even a thug could kill a soldier.
If a thug found an opening and stabbed, how could anyone survive?
In small fights, thugs could have the advantage. Of course, this didn’t apply to knights or those beyond human limits.
And it didn’t apply now.
“Don’t do it.”
Enkrid warned. His Troublemaker Squad fought unconventionally, outside traditional strategy and tactics. They thrived in battles against large numbers, coming back unscathed, much less thirty armed thugs, none of whom were soldiers. This was a suicide mission for the thugs.
“Let them be. Some only cry when they see a coffin.”
“Brother, it seems divine punishment is required.”
“Stand back and watch.”
Oddly, even Audin and Ragna seemed eager. Jaxon stepped forward silently. He drew his sword and took a step forward. A hasty thug rushed forward, brandishing a scimitar. The blade swung toward Jaxon’s head. Jaxon parried the scimitar with his sword, letting the blade slide off and then sliced downward.
Rip.
His sword cut through the thug’s abdomen. It seemed effortless, but it was enough to split the thug’s belly and reveal his guts.
“Gah.”
The thug, spilling pink intestines, collapsed to his knees and fell over. That was the beginning.
“Only kill those who attack.”
Enkrid commanded. Rem swung his axes without moving from his spot. He was a human blender. A thug swinging a flail had it cut in half, but before he could retreat, his head was split open by an axe.
He fell backward, spilling blood and brains. Ragna mechanically swung his arming sword downward. No fancy techniques, but with each swing, more bodies piled up. Skulls split and shoulders were severed. Audin wielded two short clubs, deflecting incoming blades.
Clang! Clang! Clang!
Audin's side was the noisiest. He deflected weapons and closed the distance. He moved quickly, almost as fast as Rem. Once close, he swung his clubs to break legs.
Crack, snap!
“Arghhh!”
The screams of those with broken legs echoed through the clearing. Enkrid worried that the patrol might show up. Fortunately, no one came.
Kraiss found it expected.
‘Half an hour from the tunnel.’
The hideout was at the edge of the city. This area was likely a high-end residential district, invested in by wealthy merchants. Usually, it was sparsely populated. Plus, the Gielpin guild was a crime organization. They probably bribed the higher-ups.
‘They ensured no one would come by.’
Better to have no one around than patrols passing by. Kraiss wasn’t fazed by their numbers nor felt threatened. He was part of the Troublemaker Squad. He roughly knew his squad’s capabilities.
Enkrid, now a high-ranking soldier, struggled only when facing tougher foes.
‘All of us are at least as good as the Border Guard.’
So, the answer was clear.
The thugs stood no chance.
Kraiss's mind buzzed with future plans. He had even leaked some information on purpose.
‘Deal with that friend later.’
The leaked information and the current situation were partly his doing.
Would anyone notice?
Maybe the squad leader. He seemed simple but could be sharp. Rem might figure it out with clues, but he didn’t understand city dynamics well.
‘Probably not.’
Ragna and Audin wouldn’t even consider it. Jaxon would focus on his own goals, ignoring other details.
So, it was fine.
Meanwhile, bodies piled up, and Audin’s side echoed with screams.
“Arghhh!”
Audin didn't stop at breaking one leg. He made sure to return and break the other leg as well. And he didn’t forget to preach.
“I don’t expect you to be saints. Just stop living a life that harms your neighbors.”
Breaking legs while giving a sermon meant no one understood a word he said. Still, Audin remained consistent.
Enkrid’s eyes were busy. At first, he was mesmerized by Jaxon’s disciplined movements.
‘Orthodox swordsmanship.’
It was basic orthodox swordsmanship. Using the opponent’s blade for a counterattack, directing the opponent's movements with precise sword paths. And there was also fast swordsmanship. A balanced attack and defense, the essence of orthodox swordsmanship.
Beyond simple sword forms, Jaxon’s judgment in wielding the sword stood out. He chose the surest means to kill. His sword was meant for killing. There was much to learn.
Next, Enkrid’s eyes turned to Rem. It was just him smashing approaching enemies, but the trajectory of his axe created unexpected patterns.
‘How can he do that?’
It was a unique form, neither orthodox nor unorthodox. It was understandable. Rem’s axe swings relied entirely on instinct. If categorized, it would be eccentric swordsmanship.
Of course, since he used an axe, it would be eccentric axemanship. Enkrid learned from this as well.
Ragna’s heavy swordsmanship was the same. It showed the extreme of basic swordsmanship he had learned. Any sloppy block was immediately penetrated to hit the target. Each strike shattered skulls and severed shoulders.
Audin’s martial arts were another matter. Basic swordsmanship fundamentally relied on martial arts. Without using fists and feet, one couldn't claim to have proper swordsmanship. Learning close combat was essential. In this regard, Audin's fighting provided the most to learn.
He watched carefully how Audin broke legs with two short clubs. Previously, he wouldn’t have grasped the actions even if he saw them, but now the movements were engraved in his mind.
Enkrid was so absorbed in observing and stealing techniques from the four that he forgot his surroundings. Translating these observations into actual skills would be another matter.
But there was much to learn.
The fight didn’t last long. It couldn’t take long. Many lost the will to fight. In the midst of this, Jaxon, uncharacteristically tenacious, carved a path. Towards the guild leader with the cane.
Jaxon swiftly closed the distance and swung his sword. A downward horizontal slash aimed at the head. The guild leader drew a concealed blade from his cane, revealing a sword stick. The elongated blade blocked Jaxon’s sword with a metallic clang.
The two men’s swords sparked. Two henchmen behind the guild leader tried to intervene.
“Don't.”
“Let them fight.”
Rem and Ragna, who had approached, spoke. The two henchmen looked at each other.
Should they attack?
Their eyes turned to the path Rem and Ragna had taken. It was a trail of blood. Only corpses lay behind them. The survivors were those too scared to fight and those who hadn’t moved.
The two henchmen silently lowered their weapons. Both held daggers. They sheathed them and knelt quietly. It was a gesture of surrender and submission.
“You bastards!”
The guild leader yelled, seeing his henchmen's actions.
But what could he do?
The most important thing in the world was one’s own life. Only the ones swept up by the mob mentality were pitiful. Jaxon’s face remained impassive. His brown eyes, ringed with red, fixed on the guild leader.
“I surrender!”
The guild leader shouted. Jaxon didn't listen.
“I said I surrender! Why are you doing this? If you want money, I can give you money!”
His tone grew urgent.
Clang clang clang clang clang!
Jaxon’s sword rapidly struck the sword stick five times, each blow sparking in the winter night. Among the night’s darkness and the flickering torches. Among the dead bodies and the groaning wounded. Among the frightened and those who had caused the fear.
Jaxon’s voice rang out.
“I don’t like your face.”
‘What kind of bullshit is this?’
That was the guild leader’s last thought. Jaxon’s sword tore through the guild leader’s fine clothes and sliced his throat.
Shkkk.
A chilling sound.
The guild leader died with wide, indignant eyes. He still had much to say. He knew who backed him. How much money he had funneled to those in power. It was unfair and infuriating.
Naturally. Those killed by the sword always found it unfair. Jaxon let his bloody sword hang by his side. By then, all the other fights had ended.
Enkrid closed his eyes to replay his squad members' movements and opened them. It was time to sort things out.
In the cold night air of winter, with torches blazing, Enkrid stepped forward. He happened to be standing right in the center. Surrounded by torches, shadows gathered, and all eyes focused on him. With everyone's attention, Enkrid spoke.
“Anyone else want to cross over?”
One sentence was enough.
All the survivors dropped their weapons.
Chapter 66: Second Job Proposal
“Let’s kill them all.”
Rem said this while holding his blood-stained axe, and some had even wet themselves in fear. The terrified criminals, already demoralized, begged for their lives.
“P-Please, spare us.”
It was understandable that they were scared.
Rem thought they should be killed. Coming from the western frontier, where they were often called savages, he had learned early that you don’t leave enemies behind.
“They definitely sent assassins, so there’s no point in arguing about who did what. Just slit their throats and be done with it. It’s cleaner that way.”
The terrified criminals remained silent, too scared to speak. Rem stood between them and Enkrid, ready to swing his axe at any moment.
“Where did you throw your blanket?”
Rem was about to insist on killing them himself if Enkrid didn’t want to, but then Enkrid asked a strange question.
“What?”
“Your blanket.”
When they left the barracks, Rem had been wrapped up in a blanket. At some point, he had discarded it.
“Near the entrance to the alley?”
Before they encountered the beggars, Rem’s instincts had kicked in, preparing him for battle.
“Then, where are you going to sleep tonight?”
Rem didn’t know why Enkrid kept asking about the blanket, but he had a plan from the beginning.
“I’ll just take the blanket from one of those guys who’s always staying out. Don’t worry, I won’t take yours.”
“Touch my stuff, and I’ll kill you. No, I’ll definitely kill you.”
Jaxon, the one who frequently stayed out, responded. Jaxon often met women in the city and was rarely at the barracks at night.
“You bastard, you don’t even use it.”
“Don’t touch it, savage.”
“You sneaky alley cat. You’re so stingy.”
Seeing them bicker, Enkrid clapped his hands.
“There’s no need for that, Rem.”
Enkrid had a plan from the start when he targeted the Thieves’ Guild. A plan more reasonable than Rem’s clumsy blanket-snatching scheme. Half of his motivation was because he suspected the thieves' guild of sending the assassin, and the other half was for a different plan altogether.
‘This is unexpected.’
He hadn’t fully believed the guild was behind the assassination attempt, knowing Azpen was likely responsible. Had he bet money on the guild being the mastermind, he would have wagered only a few pennies.
But whether they were behind it or not, there was a more important plan.
“It’s pretty cold out, isn’t it? Wouldn’t you like to be warm?”
Rem tilted his head, looking puzzled.
“What?”
Only Kraiss, with his sharp mind, understood. He blinked his large eyes and looked at their squad leader.
Enkrid nodded lightly. How many years had he spent in the mercenary world to train his sword? He knew about the Vallen-style mercenary swordsmanship, but he had learned much more beyond just sword skills.
For example,
‘It’s only fair to rob a thief who tried to rob you.’
Something like that. Enkrid had made up his mind. He didn’t think this would affect his dreams. After all, they were just criminals. Their accumulated wealth was not earned through honest means. There might be repercussions, but he felt confident in handling them.
“Let’s rob them. Maybe we can get some heated beast hides for the barracks, if not a magic heater.”
Silence followed. It was an unexpected turn of events.
Rem laughed.
“That’s right. What comes from the land I secure is mine.”
Rem's way of putting it.
“Warm?”
Even Ragna reacted. Nobody liked the cold.
“Haha, the Lord has spoken; take from the thieves and use it for good.”
Was that really written in the scriptures? Or was it taught at the temple? Probably not.
But Audin firmly believed in what he said, justifying their actions.
“Not bad.”
Jaxon also nodded.
“Are we just going to rob them?”
Kraiss offered a more advanced idea.
“Let’s discuss it inside. It’s cold.”
The temperature quickly cooled the heat from the blood and innards of the dead. They immediately went inside the mansion. Kraiss prompted the hesitant criminals to follow, ensuring even those with broken legs were helped in.
“Bring them all in.”
Kraiss’s words made the criminals exchange nervous glances, considering escaping.
Would running be a better option?
Their faces showed their indecision.
“We will chase you. That man with the axe, or the one who likes breaking legs, will come after you.”
Ragna and Jaxon fought well, but the criminals feared Rem with his axe and Audin with his clubs the most. They were terrifying.
“You think you can avoid the patrols of the border guards? Or explore the season’s end where monsters roam? You’ll freeze or become monster food. We won’t kill you. Just come inside.”
Kraiss was a master of persuasion. Enkrid, entering and listening to Kraiss, offered a compliment.
“You’d make a great con artist.”
“Is that a compliment?”
“Yes.”
“Doesn’t sound like one.”
Inside, a fire burned in the fireplace, and it felt like someone lived there. On the mantel above the fireplace were two practice swords and a shield, and paintings adorned the walls.
“Are these expensive?”
Enkrid glanced at the paintings. Kraiss answered without a close look.
“No. They’re cheap. I wonder who would buy such things.”
Even Enkrid, lacking artistic sense, agreed.
“I could draw better with my foot.”
Rem seemed to share the same opinion. Standing by the fireplace, their shadows stretched long behind them.
“Light the torches. It’s dark.”
Enkrid warmed himself by the fire and spoke. No one moved until Enkrid added,
“Now that Gielpin is dead, someone else should step up.”
“Gielpin isn’t dead.”
One of the uninjured criminals stepped forward, a bald man with a head like a beach. He would have been blinding in daylight. He had a long scar above his eyebrow, but the combination of the scar and baldness didn’t make him look menacing. His drooping eyes and thick lips made it hard to take him seriously.
What?
“Gielpin isn’t dead?”
Did he have some monster-like regeneration ability?
Did he survive with his throat cut?
He didn’t seem to. The bald man spoke.
“I’m Gielpin.”
What was this situation?
“That guy wasn’t the leader? Oh, I see, it’s like a lizard cutting off its tail.”
Kraiss pointed outside and answered his own question. Enkrid remembered a tale from his mercenary days.
“Sometimes criminal guilds do that, naming their group after a subordinate.”
“Why?”
“So they can sacrifice the subordinate and escape if things go bad, like when the military storms in to purge criminals.”
“Why do you know this so well?”
“I was in that line of work briefly. It’s rare, but some real bastards do it.”
Enkrid had never encountered this himself. Usually, leaders named their groups after themselves out of pride. Using a subordinate’s name meant the guy outside was a real scumbag.
“A real bastard.”
Enkrid muttered, making sense of the situation. Ragna, confused, asked what was going on. Kraiss, with his quick wit, explained the situation. Enkrid’s plan had been simple but plausible.
Target the Thieves' Guild, and if they cooperated, accept their offering and leave. If they resisted, beat them and take their offering.
There might be repercussions, but he was confident in handling them. He trusted his skills and his squad.
But there was an unexpected connection to the assassination attempt on him.
So what?
‘What does that matter?’
“Will it really be warm?”
Rem whispered too close, making Enkrid uncomfortable.
“Get lost.”
Enkrid turned to Gielpin. The bald man nervously scratched his head and spoke.
“Kill me, but spare the others. Some of them have sick mothers to take care of.”
“It’s not justifiable to rob others because you have hardships.”
Having a sick mother doesn’t excuse putting a knife to someone’s chest for gain.
“Just spare us, please.”
Enkrid, arms crossed, stared straight at Gielpin. This guy had guts. His plea was impressive.
So, why didn’t he fight earlier?
“I wouldn’t fight for a bastard who uses my name to save his own skin.”
The two former bodyguards nodded behind him. They had narrowly survived. Their disdain for their dead leader was clear.
“So, will you cough up what you’ve hoarded? Then you can go peacefully.”
Enkrid stuck to his plan.
“If he hands it over, there’s no need to kill him.”
Comparing pioneer beliefs to cold weather was absurd. Rem agreed.
Would the others think differently?
“No. But the key to the safe was hidden by that bastard.”
“That’s okay.”
They had a magician who could open locked doors with a knock. A safe box would be easy.
Gielpin was wise. Promising not to kill anyone, he surrendered all their wealth.
“Oh, heated hides!”
“If you take everything, the guards in the alley will die.”
He referred to the beggars guarding the alleys they had killed. Hearing they had layered their shabby clothes with beast hides, Kraiss commented,
“These are useless if they’re bloody.”
Taking from the dead beggars was no longer an option. Enkrid looked at Gielpin again.
‘He took care of even his lowest subordinates.’
He seemed more generous than the actual guild leader. Everyone followed his lead, even the formidable bodyguards.
“Leave some.”
Enkrid intervened. Fortunately, none of them were greedy. Except maybe one.
Kraiss was the greedy member of the squad. But he didn’t seem interested in taking anything this time.
“Not taking anything?”
“No. By the way, I have something to discuss.”
Enkrid had something to discuss too. The criminals were forewarned. The leak was obvious. Not from within the squad. Only two people knew about the raid.
‘The company commander and platoon leader.’
Could they be taking bribes from a criminal guild?
‘Probably not.’
That left only one place.
‘Vanessa’s Pumpkin Soup.’
Kraiss had whispered to the waitress, hinting about the raid.
“Was the waitress deliberate?”
“Oh, you noticed? Smart, aren’t you?”
Not bad. Years of surviving in a tough world had honed his instincts.
“Yes. There are many who secretly provide information to this guild. The waitress was probably their spy. A lively waitress at an inn is perfect for gathering information. Scary, isn’t it? That innocent-looking girl was a thief’s informant.”
It wasn’t scary. Kraiss was scarier, knowing and using it.
“I wasn’t sure. This confirmed it.”
He should have said earlier. It was a sneaky move. Realizing his mistake, Kraiss made excuses.
“Forget it. Next time, tell me in advance.”
Kraiss must have considered the squad’s skills. Enkrid found this method easier too. Otherwise, they’d have to chase down survivors. So, Kraiss had a point. After gathering their strength, what could they gain from destroying the thieves' guild?
“Hey, squad leader, don’t you need money?”
Kraiss asked Enkrid directly, blinking his large eyes. That look meant he was up to something. Kraiss knew how to use his appearance.
