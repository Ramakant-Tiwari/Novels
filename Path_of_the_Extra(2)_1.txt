One day, while engrossed in the book 'Path of Heroes: Battle Against the End,' his life took an unexpected turn. Halfway through the story, he inexplicably found himself transmigrated into the world of Path of Heroes, inhabiting the body of Azriel Crimson—a character never mentioned in the story's first half.

Chapter 67: First Floor [1]

Azriel stepped cautiously away from the black hole, his senses overwhelmed by the atmosphere around him.

The air was thick and heavy, tinged with a faint metallic tang that clung to the back of his throat.

The light was dim, filtering through a perpetual haze that seemed to hang in the air like a shroud.

Massive columns lined the walls, their surfaces worn and cracked, yet they still bore faint traces of ancient carvings, now barely discernible.

These towering pillars stretched upward into the darkness, disappearing into the shadowy abyss above.

Ahead, a long corridor extended into the gloom, flanked by statues of armored figures.

Their faces were chipped away by time, their weapons dulled and corroded, yet their stances remained imposing, as if they were still vigilant guardians of this forsaken place.

The walls on either side were etched with faded murals depicting scenes of battle, conquest, and something more—rituals, perhaps—but the details were seemingly lost to the relentless decay of time.

The ground beneath his feet was uneven, littered with rubble and the occasional remnants of shattered pottery or fragments of bone, which crunched with each step.

Above, the ceiling was swallowed by darkness, though Azriel could just make out the edges of what might have once been grand archways or domes, now crumbling and worn, their former grandeur reduced to dust and ruin.

The entire place reeked of forgotten history, a lingering sense of something once mighty now brought low for some reason...

"Welcome to the first floor."

Jasmine's voice broke the silence, her tone laced with amusement as she watched his reaction.

She couldn't blame him, nor the other students who were beginning to rise, their expressions mirroring Azriel's awe.

The Void Dungeon was a place that defied explanation; no recordings or pictures could be taken here, and there was no signal to reach anyone on the surface once inside.

The dungeon existed in its own isolated world.

"It certainly is massive."

"It is."

Tearing his gaze away from the awe-inspiring surroundings to focus on the cadets and instructors.

The instructors had already moved to the back, clearly intending to let the students take the lead, while the cadets were still transfixed by the scene before them.

But something in the darkness ahead caught Azriel's attention.

"My dear sister—"

"Nope, nope! I can't hear you. Nu-uh, I'm just a guide here."

Jasmine cut him off with a playful grin, leaning casually against the wall before sliding down to sit.

Azriel's lips twitched in irritation.

'As if you're going to act like a proper guide!'

He thought, knowing full well that Jasmine would likely enjoy watching him figure things out on his own.

Skritch—!

A sound pierced through the heavy silence, like nails scraping against an unseen surface in the darkness of the corridor.

The only light they had came from the torches scattered, but there were none in that stretch of the corridor.

Skritch—!

Azriel's pulse quickened at the second, more pronounced sound.

It was an unsettling, almost metallic scrape that seemed to crawl across his nerves.

He glanced around and noticed he wasn't alone in his apprehension.

Celestina and Lumine exchanged troubled looks, their brows furrowed in confusion.

They moved closer to him.

"What is that sound?"

Celestina's voice was a mix of curiosity and concern.

Azriel shook his head in response.

"I don't know."

Skritch—!

Skritch—!

The sound grew louder, more insistent.

Other cadets began to notice as well, their faces turning pale, eyes darting nervously.

"What the hell is that?"

"Don't tell me it's a void creature."

"Already…?"

Skritch—!

Skritch—!

The scraping was relentless now, increasing in volume and frequency.

The noise grated on their nerves, growing more and more irritating with each passing moment.

The atmosphere grew thick with tension as the sound seemed to close in on them.

.

.

Skritch—!

.

.

Skritch—!

.

.

Skritch—!

.

.

Then, as suddenly as it had started, the sound stopped.

A suffocating silence fell over the corridor, broken only by the faint echo of their own breathing.

Azriel squinted into the darkness ahead, trying to pierce through the oppressive gloom. He could see nothing but shadows.

'What is going on here?'

Jasmine remained by one of the ancient statues, her expression unreadable, while the instructors joined her, their own faces masked with unreadable expressions.

It was clear that something was about to happen.

Drip... Drip...!

Azriel's attention snapped down to his feet as something wet splashed onto the floor.

Drip... Drip...!

He looked up, only to see the dark expanse above, unlit by any torches.

Yet water continued to drip steadily from the ceiling.

"Can someone light the ceiling?"

Azriel's voice cut through the tension, directed at one person in particular.

"I can do it,"

Lumine said, stepping forward with a nod.

Celestina and Azriel stepped back, their eyes fixed on Lumine as the other cadets watched with bated breath.

Fizzle...!

A fireball ignited in Lumine's hand, crackling with heat and light.

Swoosh—!

Lumine hurled the fireball toward the ceiling, and the dark space was suddenly illuminated.

Azriel squinted against the sudden brightness.

When his vision adjusted, his eyes widened in horror.

There, clinging to the ceiling with its hands and feet, was a void creature.

Its presence was almost more terrifying in the light.

The creature's eyes, were fixed directly on Azriel, as though it were staring into his very soul.

The sight sent a chill down his spine.

The creature was grotesque—humanoid in shape but with raw, exposed flesh where blood oozed through the gaps in its skin.

It wore a metal mask that covered the lower part of its face, stained with the drool that leaked beneath.

Its long, black nails were sharp and jagged, and its eyes, devoid of any visible pupils, locked onto Azriel with a chilling intensity.

Every muscle in Azriel's body tensed, his instincts screaming to flee, but he couldn't tear his gaze away from the abhorrent creature.

It was the stuff of nightmares, and it was watching him with a predatory hunger.

A low growl emanated from behind the metal mask of the creature, a sound that seemed to reverberate through the very marrow of Azriel's bones.

'Why the hell is it staring at me!?'

Despite the numerous cadets around, its chilling gaze was fixed solely on Azriel.

It seemed like the creature had no interest in the other students, its attention fixed solely on Azriel.

Perhaps it was drawn to him because he was closest to the darkened corridor.

He knew he wasn't the strongest here—not with his sister and the instructors around.

Or maybe it was something as trivial as the creature simply taking a disliking to his face.

Who could say?

The other students were paralyzed, their faces etched with terror at the creature's grotesque form.

Without warning, as if the fireball had ignited its fury, the void creature lunged at Azriel.

Its claw-like hands were poised to slash at his neck, a grotesque blur of movement.

Gritting his teeth, Azriel summoned Void Eater to his right hand, red lightning crackling violently around him.

Crackle—!

'A welcome party from a mere Grade 2 Beast,' he thought bitterly.

Defying expectations, Azriel remained still.

The red lightning coiled around his katana and hand.

With no further warning, he hurled Void Eater at the creature with a speed that defied the normal human eye.

Shlick—!

The blade sliced through the air, piercing the creature's forehead with a sickening crunch.

Its advance was abruptly halted. It crashed to the ground with a heavy thud, landing right at Azriel's feet.

'That was too damn close...'

"Hooo..."

"That..."

"He killed it like it was nothing..."

The cadets, freed from their paralysis, stared in disbelief at the dead creature.

Azriel's face was grim as he gripped Void Eater with both hands.

The katana slipped free with a wet, squelching sound, leaving behind a dark, coagulating trail of blood that pooled and dripped rhythmically onto the floor.

A few couldn't hold back their revulsion and started vomiting at the sight of the blood.

Not everyone here had killed a void creature before; some couldn't handle the sight of a dead body, whether human or not, or the blood.

Before anyone could react any further though, the creature's body began to disintegrate.

White sparkles swirled from the remains before the entire form vanished into nothingness.

All that was left was a single mana core, glinting faintly on the ground.

"...You alright, Azriel?"

Lumine's voice was filled with concern.

"Yeah, I'm fine, thanks."

Azriel responded, offering a small smile.

He was trying to reassure them, though inside he was unsettled.

The act of killing, especially something so disturbingly humanoid, had left him shaken.

He bit his inner cheek, struggling to suppress the nausea that churned in his stomach, as he fought to keep his composure.

'I need to get used to this...'

Skritch—!

The void dungeon seemed to mock his thoughts.

From deeper in the corridor came another ominous sound.

Skritch—!

Skritch—!

Skritch—!

Azriel and the other cadets' faces grew even more grim.

Skritch—!

It didn't seem to be just one void creature this time.

Chapter 68: First Floor [2]

"This... Please tell me it's over!"

"I can't go on anymore!"

"How is this only the first floor? We haven't even moved forward at all!"

"I just want to go home..."

The cadets slumped down one by one, collapsing from exhaustion as they finished off the last of the void creatures, which were apparently called Prowlers.

Though not extremely strong, the Prowlers were a nuisance, hunting together in packs.

As one might expect, fighting a horde of them, especially with their sharp claws, wasn't easy.

Blood and its disgusting stench clung to many of the cadets.

Some were already injured by the Prowlers, though none seriously.

Surprisingly, or perhaps not, the cadets who fought the most were...

"Seriously, those two—how is there not a single scratch on them?"

"Not even a drop of blood on them..."

Azriel and Celestina were among the cadets who had fought the most Prowlers, yet they seemed to be the least injured.

"As for him..."

Then there was Lumine, who, though not injured, was covered in disgusting blood.

Even Yelena didn't dare get close to him.

"We should split the mana cores among everyone. Azriel, how should we do it?"

Lumine spoke, at least considerate enough not to move towards anyone.

The others, hearing him, all listened intently.

They were nervous about how the mana cores would be divided and were thankful in their hearts for Lumine's consideration.

Azriel, however, looked at him, confused.

"Why are you asking me?"

"Huh, I mean..."

Lumine was at a loss for words.

Wasn't it obvious why?

Celestina looked at him blankly.

"Because you're the Apex. Everyone here sees you as the leader."

Azriel blinked, surprised.

"Is that so?"

"Yes, that is so."

Celestina affirmed, and the others nodded their heads in agreement.

Suddenly, Azriel smiled—a smile that didn't reach his eyes—and placed his hand on her shoulder.

"Then I step down as leader and hand you the crown, Princess."

Just like that, he began walking towards Jasmine, who was sitting and watching him curiously.

He could have given the role to the second rank, but Azriel knew it was better for Celestina, whom the other cadets looked up to more than Lumine.

After all, she was the Princess of the Frost Clan.

"Huh? W-wait, Azriel, what do you mean I'm the leader now? What about the mana cores?"

Azriel turned and looked at her.

"It's as I said. I'm handing down my supposed role as leader to you. I'm sure you're better suited for it. As for the mana cores, I don't need any of them, so they're all for you guys."

'I would even give up my title as Apex since I've already achieved what I wanted with it.'

But unfortunately, it wasn't something he could just hand down.

But being a leader?

That was definitely a no.

It just wasn't who he was.

Celestina and the others stared at him, stunned, as he sat down next to his sister, closing his eyes and relaxing.

It was as if the Apex had sidelined himself.

Which he did.

*****

When a god blesses a human, you would naturally think of it as a good thing.

After all, a blessing is meant to be beneficial.

It's supposed to support you, help you, and save you.

A blessing is supposed to make you stronger.

In this world, being blessed by one of the gods means exactly that.

But...

For the first time, Azriel realized the harsh truth behind his blessing.

Perhaps this was why the God of Death was rarely mentioned, never a player in the book.

A neutral entity, content to observe from afar—or perhaps the god had already blessed someone, yet remained unintroduced.

But the reality was undeniable:

The God of Death's blessing wasn't a blessing at all.

It was a curse.

Or at least, that's what Azriel believed.

Perhaps it was something in Azriel himself that made the God of Death choose him.

Just as Lumine, with his desire to be a hero, seemed destined for the God of Life's blessing.

The more lives Lumine saved, the stronger his desire to continue—was it the god that chose him, or the blessing that shaped him into who he was?

But that doesn't matter.

What matters is that Azriel may never know the answer to that question.

Because he wasn't chosen by the God of Life.

No.

He was chosen by the God of Death.

*****

Something was wrong.

That was the conclusion Jasmine reached after carefully analyzing Azriel during the fight against the Prowlers.

She had anticipated this—after all, she had experienced the same thing when she first arrived last year.

In fact, Azriel had done even better than she had back then.

Glancing at the instructors, she noticed them talking to ten injured students, who were requesting to return to the surface.

Jasmine had expected that.

There was no obligation to stay; if cadets wanted to leave, they could request permission from the instructors.

These students must have realized they weren't ready to face the Void Dungeon.

They would likely transfer to a different academy, one less challenging than this, and attempt the Void Dungeon when they were better prepared.

Jasmine didn't blame them.

Not everyone could keep up with the pace of the Hero Academy.

Perhaps they would still become heroes, just at their own pace.

The Hero Academy was notoriously difficult, which was why most cadets had the sense to recognize when they weren't cut out for it.

But that wasn't what mattered to her.

No, what mattered most was her little brother, sitting next to her with his eyes closed and his expression unreadable.

She had watched him fight all nine Prowlers by himself. He didn't seem to have any trouble at first.

But...

Something was wrong.

After the fourth kill, she noticed him starting to slow down, holding himself back.

It didn't make sense—she hadn't seen any injuries on him, so why was Azriel becoming less consistent?

On the contrary, Cadet Lumine was the real powerhouse here.

The way he single-handedly destroyed fourteen Prowlers even impressed Jasmine.

She hadn't expected someone so strong to be here, but now she understood why he was ranked second, right after Celestina.

Currently, all the cadets were under Celestina's leadership, dividing the mana cores on the ground.

Thanks to her guidance, there were no issues; everyone was obedient, even Vergil.

Although, it was more accurate to say he was doing the same as Azriel—leaning against the wall with his eyes closed, completely unbothered.

"Huh... hey, why is this mana core empty?"

"Wait, yeah, this one too!"

Jasmine furrowed her brows, noticing the sudden commotion.

'Someone already consumed them...?'

She was certain no one had secretly consumed the mana cores—she would have noticed. Even if someone had, she wouldn't have minded, but still...

'How did that happen?'

"Wait, this one is empty as well!"

"What the hell, who's secretly consuming them!?"

Ten.

The number of empty mana cores.

'Wait...'

Jasmine's eyes widened as she looked toward Azriel, who was pretending to be oblivious.

But she knew better.

Those mana cores belonged to the Prowlers her little brother had killed. Yet she had never seen him consume them.

"Azriel, how did you—"

"Not now, Jasmine."

Jasmine flinched at the sudden low tone in Azriel's voice.

'Is he mad at me?'

She couldn't recall doing anything recently to upset him. In fact, he hadn't gotten mad at her since his return.

'No... I knew it. Something is wrong with him.'

'Did fighting Void creatures affect him?'

This was what she feared most.

She didn't know how much damage the Void Realm had done to him, so when she was offered the chance to go as a guide, she didn't hesitate to accept.

"Azriel, what's wrong?"

Azriel furrowed his brows, seemingly annoyed.

But when he opened his eyes, Jasmine froze.

Jasmine could feel the bloodlust directed at her.

She wasn't the only one.

The instructors, who had just sent the other ten students away,

also noticed it. They looked at Azriel, confused and stunned.

No one else seemed to pick up on it—it was subtle, but they did.

'Ah...'

She finally understood.

The Void Realm had indeed affected him.

Azriel was holding back.

After the fourth kill, she should have realized it sooner.

But what he was holding back wasn't just his strength or his emotions.

He was holding back himself.

This must have been the real reason he sidelined himself.

The way he looked at her with those sharp eyes—it was the look of someone ready to kill.

"It's nothing, my dear sister. I was just thinking of something unpleasant."

Jasmine snapped out of her thoughts as Azriel suddenly started speaking to her in his usual tone.

But those eyes of his—they didn't change.

"Azriel, maybe it's better to go back to the surface."

Azriel shook his head.

"I'm fine. You're overthinking it. I'll enter the ring soon, just not yet. There's no point in me joining them if most of them are just going to use me as a shield. They won't grow that way."

Jasmine sighed reluctantly.

She didn't entirely believe him, but he did have a valid point.

Most of the cadets did use him and the others on the front line as meat shields.

"Fine... just don't push yourself, alright?"

A chuckle escaped his lips.

"Even if I do, I've got you here."

"That's right, but I'm not allowed to guide them unless it takes more than two days..."

But if Azriel needed her help, there was no way she would let those instructors stop her.

After all, they were just first-year instructors.

And she could beat them easily.

Chapter 69: First Floor [3]

After dividing the mana cores, it became clear that there weren't quite enough for all the cadets.

Fortunately, those who didn't receive their share didn't dwell on it, knowing they would have countless other opportunities to gather more mana cores in the Void Dungeon.

However, the mystery of the ten consumed mana cores lingered. Celestina didn't know who had taken them, and she didn't have the time to figure it out.

Instead, she had to focus on organizing the cadets, who were in disarray—all thanks to Azriel, who had effectively dumped the leadership role onto her.

She couldn't blame him, though.

He never asked for it in the first place, and at least he had the wisdom to pass it to her, knowing she was the second-best choice, even though Lumine was stronger.

Still, she wished he would take on some of the responsibility of leading the cadets, rather than sidelining himself.

His absence made everything more difficult to manage.

Morale among the cadets was already low, and she didn't blame them.

Ten cadets had left the Void Dungeon, there was the unresolved mystery of the mana cores, Azriel had sidelined himself, and even Vergil, one of the top students, was doing the same.

He just sat there with his eyes closed, giving off an air that discouraged anyone from approaching him.

Celestina didn't bother him either.

If Vergil wasn't causing trouble, she would let him be—for now, at least.

At least he didn't seem to care about the mana cores, much like Azriel.

But the situation wasn't good.

They hadn't even made any progress, and morale was already low.

Determined to change that, Celestina made her way toward the instructors, drawing the attention of all the cadets.

Even Vergil opened his eyes, looking curious.

"Is it possible for me to ask a question?"

The three instructors hesitated for a moment, exchanging glances before nodding.

"Of course, as long as it doesn't involve us assisting you," Instructor Alicia, a woman with brown hair and brown eyes, replied with a smile.

Celestina nodded.

"What would happen if someone, or everyone, decided to split up?"

The cadets tensed, some even paling at the thought that Celestina might abandon them too.

Instructor Kevin pulled something out of his storage ring.

Celestina narrowed her eyes.

"A drone..."

Instructor Alicia nodded.

"That's correct. Anyone here is free to challenge the first floor on their own. We'll follow you with one of our drones. But keep in mind, you have two days before the other class arrives on this floor. When they do, Cadet Jasmine will be allowed to act as a guide for anyone she wishes. If you're still on the first floor by then, she can choose to help the other classes instead of yours."

Hearing this, Celestina nodded, feeling grateful as she walked back to the center of the group.

'So, everyone can leave if they want, and Jasmine can move freely, guiding anyone she chooses.'

It was a bit strange in her eyes, but perhaps it was meant to speed up the progress of certain cadets.

But that didn't matter.

The instructors had been generous enough to give her information she could work with.

Feeling everyone's eyes on her, she swept her gaze over each student, even Azriel, who looked at her with amusement.

But...

'His eyes...'

For some reason, his eyes reminded her of her father, like when they used to go hunting together for fun.

'Even though he looks like he's being lazy, he hasn't let his guard down... Maybe that's why he's the Apex.'

Shaking her head inwardly, she parted her lips.

"As you all heard, it's possible to venture into the Void Dungeon on your own if you wish. I won't hold you back. You're free to leave right now. If you choose to stay, I will take it as acceptance of my leadership, and you will follow my orders without objection."

Her clear voice cut through the air like a melody, reaching every cadet's ears.

She gave them a choice, and she wouldn't resent anyone for leaving.

If they wanted to go, they could go.

She would understand if not everyone was satisfied with her taking the reins.

Some might think Azriel should still be leading, or perhaps Lumine, who was ranked second.

But...

No one moved a muscle.

They all looked at her with determined eyes and smiles.

They would follow her.

Even Azriel and Vergil didn't budge, boosting the morale of the cadets at once.

'If they're not leaving, it means they'll help us eventually...'

There was no reason for those two to hide behind the cadets.

Everyone knew that, given the incident at the Celestial Arena.

They had just decided to sideline themselves.

For now.

Celestina broke into a smile.

"Very well. Since no one objects, I will hereby take command."

Celestina immediately set to work, dividing the cadets into three groups:

Group One was the frontline assault team, composed of the most experienced and combat-ready cadets.

This team would directly engage the dungeon's creatures and maintain the initial defense. Cadets such as Lumine, Yelena, and Celestina, along with other seasoned cadets, were assigned to this group.

Group Two was responsible for dealing with any Void creatures that managed to breach the frontline.

Their primary role was to handle threats that got past Group One, ensuring that the formation remained intact and the team's advance continued smoothly.

Group Three was the support unit.

This group was tasked with carrying healing potions and other supplies, as well as providing assistance where needed.

It included cadets who were either less experienced in combat, lacked confidence, or were still developing their skills.

There was, however, a fourth group—comprised of the three instructors, Jasmine, Azriel, and Vergil.

This group would stay further back, intending to remain out of direct combat.

The formation went smoothly under Celestina's orders, and fortunately, no one complained.

Several cadets now held the torches that were previously stuck to the walls, providing light. Lumine, due to his fire affinity, did not need a torch and illuminated the area with his own flames.

They stared into the darkened corridor ahead.

Celestina turned around looking at the cadets and nodded to herself, satisfied with the arrangement.

Even if Azriel and Vergil decided not to assist, the current setup would still be effective against another attack by Prowlers.

Celestina held her silver longsword, and Lumine had a similar soul sword.

Yelena carried a sleek black wooden bow, its surface smooth and polished to a deep sheen. The limbs were gracefully curved, with subtle obsidian inlays tracing delicate patterns.

However, unlike the other archers, she did not have any arrows visible on her back.

Celestina would normally have advised against having Yelena on the front lines, but both Lumine and Yelena had insisted that she would be fine.

After one final sweep of the cadets, Celestina turned around.

And so...

They marched into the darkness.

Chapter 70: First Floor [4]

The massive corridors all looked the same, creating the unsettling feeling of being trapped in a maze, with identical statues, walls, and floors repeating endlessly.

Yet, despite the uncanny similarity, they knew they weren't running in circles.

The first floor of the Void Dungeon was, after all, a maze—the Imperion Maze.

As they ventured deeper, they occasionally encountered prowlers, but the numbers were far fewer than those they faced at the void dungeon's entrance.

In fact, no one but Lumine had to lift a finger—he effortlessly decimated the creatures, his calm demeanor eerily reminiscent of Azriel's.

The cadets felt a sense of comfort knowing the instructors and two of the academy's top students—the apex of the first year and the apex of the second—were right behind them.

Also Vergil.

But what they didn't realize was that this comfort was a false sense of security.

If they were attacked from behind, those who gave them reassurance would disengage from the battle immediately.

Perhaps they were lucky not to have encountered a serious threat yet, but all they could do for now was keep moving forward.

Azriel marched along with the rest of the group for the past two hours, positioned between Vergil on his left and Jasmine on his right.

Ahead of him were the instructors, seemingly unconcerned with supervising him and Vergil because of Jasmine.

Still, the situation was awkward.

Vergil appeared lost in thought, walking absentmindedly, while Jasmine occasionally shot narrowed glances his way.

'She must've figured out he's the one who messed with me on the first day.'

Fortunately, it seemed she wouldn't take any action—at least not in front of him.

For Vergil's sake, Azriel knew he had to keep his overprotective sister at bay.

Not that Vergil noticed. The two hadn't even introduced themselves to each other yet.

'Great, just what I needed—another problem on my plate.'

Azriel sighed inwardly, finding the situation increasingly awkward.

His attention shifted ahead to the three instructors, all of whom wore furrowed brows, clearly concerned.

Without alerting the other cadets, Instructor Kevin discreetly released a few drones from his storage ring.

Even Azriel, who didn't fully understand the situation, could sense the reason for their cautious behavior.

The lack of prowlers or any other Void creatures was unsettling, even to him and the two at his sides.

'But... is this because of Neo Genesis?'

The only sounds echoing through the corridors were the cadets' breaths and footsteps.

'This... never happened in the book.'

Azriel mused, feeling increasingly uneasy.

'Has the plot already changed to the point that their attack patterns are different? Or is there another reason for this?'

While the cause of the unease might be connected to his survival, Azriel doubted it was related to Neo Genesis.

He was almost certain they wouldn't change their attack patterns.

But then, what was causing the absence of Void creatures?

"...Jasmine, am I overthinking the lack of warm greetings we're getting here?"

Azriel asked after a few moments of tense silence.

Jasmine took a few seconds to respond before speaking.

"You're not... something is wrong. Stay alert."

Azriel nodded at her warning.

Something was definitely amiss.

'Trouble before we've even conquered the first floor...'

"...Azriel, I need to have a word with you."

Vergil suddenly spoke, snapping Azriel out of his thoughts.

Jasmine, too, turned her narrowed eyes toward Vergil.

"What is it?"

Vergil glanced at Jasmine before replying.

"I'd like to speak without anyone listening."

'To say that right in front of her...'

Azriel glanced at Jasmine, who was glaring at Vergil before shifting her gaze to Azriel.

"Five minutes. That's all you get. We should stick close since something here is terribly wrong."

Jasmine gave a reluctant answer before moving ahead to speak with the instructors.

Once she was gone, Azriel turned to Vergil.

"Now that she's gone, what is it you want to talk about?"

Azriel studied Vergil closely.

It would be a lie to say he hadn't noticed Vergil's odd behavior today.

He had expected Vergil to step up sooner and join the other cadets, but he hadn't.

His complexion was pale, his eyes had dark bags underneath, and he kept glancing around nervously.

Vergil spoke in a low tone, just enough for Azriel to hear.

"…Last night, I had another dream."

"What?"

Azriel stared at him, stunned.

He didn't fully understand how the Apostle of Dreams' powers worked, but he knew they always provided Vergil with valuable insights.

Initially, Azriel thought Vergil's dreams only related to other apostles nearby, but something had made him reconsider.

"What was the dream about?"

Vergil hesitated, his expression troubled.

'Is he scared…?'

The last time Vergil had shown signs of fear was when he received his blessing.

Finally, seeming to resolve himself, Vergil spoke again.

"…In that dream, I was a baby again. Yet I had all my memories intact, like my meeting with you. At first, I didn't even think it was a dream. I thought I had… regressed."

"Huh?"

Azriel looked at him, confused, but Vergil continued.

"So, I did what anyone would do after regressing: I made my life easier, and that of my family. I became stronger than before and entered the Hero Academy... but I still couldn't beat Lumine. He became the apex."

Vergil's gaze was unreadable as he continued.

"Lumine was the apex, not you. You... you didn't exist in that dream."

Azriel blinked, processing his words.

'I didn't exist?'

What did that even mean?

Was he dead, or did Vergil mean it literally?

As if sensing his confusion, Vergil elaborated.

"You weren't dead, missing, or even alive. You simply didn't exist. The name Azriel Crimson wasn't part of that world... I don't know why. Maybe it was because of my regression? Whatever the reason, I ended up second in the Hero Academy, at least managing to surpass Princess Celestina...

but in the end, it all felt meaningless."

Vergil's voice trembled slightly as he met Azriel's eyes.

"Just like today, when I entered the Void Dungeon in that dream... something happened."

Azriel swallowed hard, feeling a cold sweat forming.

"...What happened?"

Vergil bit his lip, glancing ahead to ensure no one else was listening.

He took a few deep breaths to steady himself.

"It all felt so real—breathing, eating, sleeping, dreaming, touching—I swear, I never once thought it was just a dream... but thank the gods it was."

"Vergil... what the hell happened in that dream?"

Vergil looked at him, his eyes trembling along with his shoulders.

"...I died."

Chapter 71: First Floor [5]

"Why aren't we being attacked anymore...?"

Celestina's quiet voice reached Yelena and the others at the front.

Yelena didn't respond, her gaze fixed ahead.

She knew it was crucial for her to stay vigilant—her eyes were sharper than most here, and her instincts were finely tuned.

But that was precisely why she was on high alert.

Because...

Her instincts weren't warning her of anything.

No danger.

Nothing.

It felt as if the first floor was completely deserted.

A floor that should have been teeming with void creatures, especially prowlers, was eerily empty.

And no one knew why.

They just kept walking.

Everything looked the same, like a distorted mirror image.

Celestina spoke quietly with Lumine and the others as they moved, but the cadets were starting to lower their guard—unlike Yelena.

She couldn't blame them.

They'd been walking for hours, and the only threats they'd encountered were a few prowlers at the start, easily dispatched by Lumine.

No one had really had the chance to test their skills.

It was mostly Lumine and Azriel who had done the fighting and killing.

Well, Azriel had sidelined himself, for reasons Yelena couldn't quite grasp.

Then there was Lumine, her childhood friend, who had been unusually quiet since they arrived at the Void Dungeon.

'...It must have happened at the hotel. He was with me the whole time, though.'

Whatever it was, she was certain it wasn't her doing.

Nor had anyone else bothered him.

So...

Her eyes widened slightly.

'Was it the system...?'

She knew about Lumine's system.

It was a secret kept strictly between the two of them.

The moment Lumine had received the [System], replacing his original unique skill, he had confided in Yelena.

Fortunately, she had managed to stop him from telling anyone else—not even their family.

If she was honest...

She didn't like the [System].

Sure, it had made Lumine significantly stronger, bringing him closer to his dream, and she was thrilled that he always helped her grow stronger as well.

But even so, she couldn't trust it.

It had come out of nowhere.

She knew nothing about it—what it wanted, how it worked, or why it existed.

It was an enigma.

And she hated the unknown.

'If it was the system, then what happened? Is it a quest?'

She couldn't ask him now, though.

Exhausted, Yelena finally broke her gaze from the path ahead and looked back.

The other students were talking among themselves as they walked, some already clinging to each other from fatigue.

But overall, they were holding up well enough.

Looking further back, she noticed the instructors.

They appeared just as confused, likely discussing the situation with Jasmine.

But what puzzled Yelena the most was seeing Azriel and Vergil at the very rear, together.

She didn't like Vergil, not after the incident he caused on the first day—insulting her and Lumine.

And she thought Azriel would feel the same, given how his name was slandered because of Vergil.

Yet here they were, together, talking.

And whatever they were discussing, it seemed important enough that they didn't want anyone else to overhear, judging by their serious expressions.

'Are they planning something together?'

It was a possibility.

Neither of them had joined the other cadets, yet they hadn't gone off on their own either.

She couldn't understand what they were thinking.

"Everyone, stop."

Celestina's voice cut through the air, commanding the attention of every cadet.

They froze, their breaths held in anticipation, thinking they were finally about to be attacked.

But...

It wasn't an attack.

No.

In front of them stood a colossal gate.

*****

Why?

Celestina couldn't understand how this had happened.

This was never supposed to be this easy, yet here they were, standing in front of the boss room.

It was utterly ridiculous, but undeniably real—they were already close to reaching the second floor, leaving the Imperion Maze behind in less than a day.

If she told anyone on the surface about this, they'd laugh in her face, calling her crazy.

Yet here was the colossal gate before them, its ancient, dust-covered engravings unreadable, the gates towering and imposing.

"Celestina, I think we should take a break here and discuss our next steps."

Lumine said, his expression unusually serious.

Celestina glanced at him, then back at the gate, and finally at the other cadets.

Each one of them looked to her, waiting for her command.

'We haven't really fought. No one is exhausted, and we could probably take on the boss if we went in now. But... everything here is off. What if going in now is a mistake?'

She was uncertain.

Her decision could potentially cost lives.

She looked towards the instructors—they wore unreadable expressions, watching her closely, but said nothing.

They weren't going to interfere.

'Does that mean it's not too serious?'

If it were, they would have stepped in, wouldn't they?

Celestina closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and then opened them again.

"We'll rest here for the day. Tomorrow, we'll fight the floor boss and proceed to the second floor."

No one objected.

The third group immediately began preparing the camp, though a few cadets looked dissatisfied with her decision.

But Celestina didn't want to take any chances.

Who knew what might change in a day?

'They can call me a coward if they want... but if that's what it takes to keep everyone alive, then so be it.'

Lumine and Yelena joined the third group, helping the other cadets set up camp.

There was no rule against bringing personal items into the Void Dungeon, as long as you had a storage ring.

Of course, the larger the storage space, the more expensive the ring.

So, while no one had brought anything extravagant like a bed, they had enough to make themselves comfortable and assist with the camp.

As the cadets began to relax and help one another, Celestina's gaze drifted to a certain duo—Azriel and Vergil.

Jasmine was surprisingly busy helping with the camp, and the instructors were inspecting the boss gate without opening it.

'They've gotten awfully close.'

Celestina thought, watching Azriel and Vergil sit together against the wall, not mingling with the others.

They weren't talking anymore, and the air between them felt tense, solemn.

It wasn't just her who noticed—no one seemed eager to get near them.

'Did something happen...?'

She shook her head.

Unlike the others, she had a responsibility here, and she needed every advantage she could get.

Celestina walked towards the two, who noticed her approach.

Azriel smiled, though it was a bit stiff, while Vergil wore an unreadable expression.

The sharp glint in Azriel's eyes had already disappeared.

As she sat down in front of them, Azriel's smile remained, though it seemed a bit forced.

Vergil, on the other hand, looked uncomfortable being so close to her.

"Celestina, is there something you need from us?"

She nodded.

"I need both of your help."

Azriel and Vergil blinked in unison.

"Our help?"

Celestina nodded again.

Azriel sighed, while Vergil remained silent, seemingly content to let Azriel speak for both of them.

"I told you I'd be handing you the crown, didn't I? Has it become too burdensome?"

Celestina furrowed her brows and shook her head.

"It's not. I can handle it, but that doesn't mean I enjoy making things harder for myself when I don't have to."

"Celestina, I'm not interested in stepping in right now. Besides, why do you need my help? You've already led everyone to the boss room perfectly. Just strike the iron while it's hot."

Celestina narrowed her eyes.

"You know this was too easy—no void creatures attacked us, no real challenges, no dangers. I don't trust this situation. Something might go wrong, and I want to prevent anyone from dying."

Azriel shrugged.

"You're overthinking it, Celestina. The floors in the Void Dungeon change from time to time. It's rare, but not impossible. You know that. Maybe we got lucky, and the dungeon's showing us some mercy. Who knows?

The trouble you're looking for might not even exist, or it might just be waiting for us on the second floor instead."

Celestina bit her lip, considering his words.

'He's right... the floors do change, and maybe it is just luck. But still...'

She couldn't rely on luck alone.

And she knew Azriel wouldn't either, so why... why was he so relaxed?

Not just him—the instructors, Jasmine—they all seemed calm.

'Is this the difference in experience...?'

If that was the case, perhaps she should heed his advice.

But...

Celestina clenched her fists tightly.

"...I'm not asking for the help of the Apex. I'm asking for the help of my friend."

Vergil looked visibly stunned by her words, while the smile on Azriel's face faded, replaced by an unreadable expression.

"I don't want to risk anyone getting hurt or... worse. So please, Azriel."

'I don't want anyone to die...'

No matter where they were, anything could happen.

That was her belief.

Celestina didn't meet his eyes as she asked for his help.

If anyone else had heard her right now, they might have thought she was losing her mind.

A tense silence followed her words, with neither Azriel nor Vergil saying anything as she felt their gazes on her for different reasons.

"...."

Finally, Azriel broke the silence sighing.

"Why... is everyone always so unfair?"

Chapter 72: Truth or Dare [1]

It took approximately an hour for the camp to be set up outside the boss room.

A campfire was soon roaring, with most of the cadets gathered around it, laughing and enjoying themselves as they roasted snacks.

If someone took a picture, you'd think they were just a group of normal students on a camping trip, not adventurers in a Void Dungeon where danger could strike at any moment.

That's how it looked to Azriel, who observed everything from a distance.

He hadn't moved from his spot.

He just watched.

Tents had been set up nearby, where some cadets were already taking naps, while others sought privacy.

It didn't feel like they were in a place where death lurked around every corner.

Even the instructors, who were supposed to be impartial, were mingling with the cadets, joining in on the lighthearted fun.

Jasmine was sitting around the fire too, alongside Celestina, Lumine, Yelena, and even Vergil, after an awkward 30-minute apology session.

Azriel had forced Vergil to go and make peace with Lumine and Yelena, following Celestina's heartfelt plea.

He basically sold him to Celestina.

Now, the air was filled with laughter and chatter that, under any normal circumstances, would attract a swarm of void creatures.

But none came.

The first floor was completely deserted, and Azriel couldn't figure out why.

He leaned his head against the cold stone wall behind him and sighed.

He had told his sister and Celestina that he would rest and had pretended to head to one of the tents.

Now, he found himself here, away from everyone, quietly overseeing the scene while suppressing his mana to avoid detection.

He was confident none of the cadets would notice, though if Jasmine or the instructors focused on him, they'd surely pick up on his presence.

The truth was, Azriel couldn't bring himself to join them.

To sit by the fire, laugh, and act like nothing was wrong.

He couldn't remember the last time he'd allowed himself to have fun.

Not that he minded watching from afar.

In a way, it was... comforting, seeing them all so carefree, their faces lit up with genuine smiles.

'How long until those smiles are taken away?'

He couldn't help but wonder.

Would it be during the boss fight?

Or maybe something else would come, something worse, that would strip them of this momentary happiness.

They were so oblivious to the dangers of this world, to the darkness creeping around the edges of their reality.

Azriel's expression darkened as his thoughts spiraled into negativity.

Frustrated, he tilted his head back and knocked it gently against the wall, closing his eyes.

'What am I even doing with my life?'

He was walking a path that seemed endless, with no clear destination.

He made decisions without reason, only guided by the vague desire to change the future from the original plot.

But what came after that?

What did he want?

He still didn't have an answer.

"U-um, e-excuse me…"

Azriel's eyes snapped open at the sound of a timid voice.

In front of him stood a girl in the academy's uniform, her black hair falling softly to her shoulders, her dark eyes wide with nervousness.

She looked like a frightened animal, trembling slightly, as if ready to bolt at any moment.

Azriel blinked, surprised.

He had thought no one had noticed him, but apparently, he was wrong.

"Can I help you, Cadet Kanae?"

The girl's eyes widened in shock.

"E-eh? Y-you know my na— ouch!"

She winced, biting her tongue mid-sentence.

Azriel suppressed a smile, trying not to laugh at her clumsiness.

'What a cute, clumsy girl…'

"It's only natural for me to know the names of my classmates. Cadet Kanae, ranked 101."

Azriel said lightly, watching as tears formed in the corners of her eyes from the pain.

"Ugh... H-how embarrassing..."

Kanae muttered to herself, cheeks flushing as she sat down in front of him, back straight and clearly nervous.

Azriel studied her for a moment, curious as to why she was here.

"So, what can I do for you, Cadet Kanae?" he asked, keeping his tone gentle to prevent her from panicking further.

"A-ah, yes... you see, um, I'm here because... they asked me to..."

Her voice grew softer and softer, trailing off to almost a whisper.

Azriel furrowed his brows.

"They asked you to?"

She nodded, avoiding his gaze.

"… It was a... dare."

"A dare?"

Kanae nodded again, too embarrassed to meet his eyes.

"I see," Azriel said, unsure how to respond.

It wasn't exactly a surprise—people were caught up in the carefree atmosphere around the campfire.

It was only natural that they'd make silly choices, especially with dares.

Still, he couldn't help but feel sorry for Kanae, who seemed mortified by the whole situation.

"I'm sorry if I was rude or interrupted you..."

Kanae said softly, her voice laced with regret.

Azriel offered her a reassuring smile.

"It's fine. You didn't interrupt me at all. Actually, I'm surprised you took the dare."

Kanae bit her lip, fidgeting.

"… I was also a little... curious about you."

Azriel raised his eyebrows in surprise.

'Curious, huh?'

He hadn't expected that.

Most cadets either avoided him or kept their distance, intimidated by his reputation.

'How bold of her...'

"What are you curious about?" he asked, smiling gently.

It was rare for one of his classmates to approach him like this.

He didn't actively avoid people, but he wasn't exactly inviting either.

Seeing that Kanae was struggling to find the right words, Azriel decided to make things easier for her.

"How about we play a game of truth or dare?"

Kanae blinked, surprised by his proposal, but after a few moments of hesitation, she nodded.

Azriel chuckled softly.

He had nothing better to do anyway, so why not pass the time with this little game?

"Then I'll start."

Azriel said, straightening his back against the wall and meeting Kanae's gaze.

This time, she didn't look away, trying her best to hold his eyes.

"Truth or dare?"

"...Truth, please," Kanae answered, her tone as polite as possible.

Azriel nodded, pausing for a few moments, his piercing gaze locked on hers.

The silence stretched just long enough to make her fidget, before he finally spoke.

"Tell me, what do you and the others think of me?"

"Eh?"

Kanae blinked, caught off guard by the question.

She had expected something more... risky.

But this?

This was different.

Azriel already had a vague idea of how people saw him, but he was still curious. How exactly did his peers perceive him?

He decided to use this moment to find out.

Kanae seemed lost in thought, her eyes darting nervously as she struggled to meet his gaze.

Sensing her discomfort, Azriel offered her a reassuring smile.

"All I ask is for the truth. I won't get mad, no matter what you say."

Kanae took a deep breath and nodded.

"If I'm honest... everyone at first thought of you as someone mysterious, boring, and... like the least liked child of the great clans. There were rumors that you were a delinquent—someone who slept with women and paid them for it, or that you abused your power to get whatever you wanted. But those were just rumors since you were almost never seen in public.

Then, out of nowhere, people started saying you either died, went missing, or were exiled. For the last two years, that's what everyone believed... until you came back."

She spoke quickly, as though trying to get everything out before her courage faded, and Azriel had to focus to keep up.

"And when you returned, the rumor about you being a delinquent became even stronger, especially after what happened on the first day. People started saying you're as strong as Prince Caleus and that you've defeated titans in the Void Realm. There are so many rumors about you that I can't even remember them all. Some say you're in a relationship with the Headmistress... or even Instructor Solomon!

Oh, and there's one where you're supposedly plotting a coup to take the throne from your father."

Kanae finally stopped, gasping for breath after her rapid-fire explanation.

"Basically, everyone thinks you're this... otherworldly, mysterious, incredibly strong person that no one can reach, and that you'd crush anyone who stands in your way."

She leaned back, clearly exhausted from talking so fast, while Azriel stared at her, completely bewildered.

"I-I see...?"

He wasn't sure how to respond to that.

'Wait, hold on... me and Freya? Hell no! What kind of absurd rumor is that? And definitely not Solomon... I'd rather bite my tongue.'

Azriel visibly cringed at the thought of being paired with either of those two psychopaths.

'And I'm certainly not interested in taking the throne from Father either. Jasmine can have that, and then complain later about how much effort it is.'

He was more than relieved not to be the heir.

Azriel sighed as he processed everything Kanae had just told him.

'...Unfortunately, except for the "otherworldly" part, the rest is pure nonsense.'

Not that he could explain that to her.

"And what about you, Cadet Kanae?"

Azriel asked after a moment.

"E-Eh? W-What about me?" she stammered, clearly flustered.

Azriel's eyes gleamed with amusement as he leaned forward slightly.

"You told me how the others think of me... but what do you think?"

Chapter 73: Truth or Dare [2]

Kanae couldn't meet his eyes, her gaze darting nervously around as if she were standing under a guillotine, one wrong word away from sealing her fate.

The tension weighed on her, but she knew it was her own doing.

She'd accepted the dare, and then agreed to Azriel's game. Now, she had no choice but to face the consequences.

After what felt like an eternity, her eyes finally met his, the intensity of his gaze urging her to answer.

Clenching her fists, she took a deep breath and looked down.

"...I think I was wrong about you."

"Wrong about me?"

Azriel's curiosity was evident, his eyebrows raised in surprise.

She nodded meekly.

"Mm. Y-You see... like the others, I thought the children of the great clans were on a completely different level. I believed the rumors, that you were... you know. But after seeing you all today..."

Her voice trailed off as she glanced over at Jasmine and Celestina, who were chatting with the other cadets.

Azriel followed her gaze and smiled faintly.

"You realized we're not that different from the rest of you, in the end."

Kanae quickly snapped her head back toward him, nodding vigorously.

"Y-Yes, that's right... though I still feel nervous."

The last part was barely a whisper, not meant for him to hear, but it did.

Azriel's smile turned wry.

'I'm still a prince in her eyes, after all...'

The gap in status was still there, unshakable.

It was almost amusing—back in his previous world, royalty had been more ceremonial, with no real power.

Yet here, humanity seemed to be moving backward, returning to the days when kings ruled with authority.

Azriel sighed, leaning back against the wall, his eyes meeting Kanae's as she fidgeted nervously in front of him.

"You don't have to stay here any longer, you know?" he said with a slight smirk. "You've completed the dare. Your friends are probably waiting for you—or worried I might've done something to you."

"Ah... r-right, I should go back," she replied, but the dejection in her voice and the brief flicker of regret in her eyes didn't escape his notice.

Azriel's grin widened.

"What is it? Do you secretly enjoy spending time with me?"

"Eh!? No! No way!"

Kanae blurted out in a flustered panic, her cheeks flushing red.

Azriel narrowed his eyes playfully.

"Oh? So now you dislike talking to me? Is that it?"

Her face paled as she waved her hands frantically in front of him, eyes wide with panic.

"No! I didn't mean it like that! I-I—"

Azriel laughed, cutting her off.

"Pfft! Relax, Cadet Kanae. I'm just messing with you."

Kanae froze, her cheeks growing even redder as she stared at him in embarrassment.

"Azriel, what are you doing here...?"

Azriel's head snapped up at the voice behind Kanae, his eyes widening slightly in surprise.

Kanae spun around as well, letting out a startled yelp, her face turning even paler.

"Sister... it seems you two have been enjoying yourselves."

Azriel said, his tone light as he eyed Jasmine and Celestina standing behind them, both looking confused.

He gave a wry smile.

'Looks like I've been caught...'

Shaking his head, Azriel parted his lips to explain.

"I couldn't sleep in the tents, so I came here to relax. Cadet Kanae was just keeping me company."

"Cadet Kanae, huh?" Jasmine said, narrowing her eyes.

"A classmate of ours."

Celestina added.

"Ranked 101."

Kanae, wide-eyed, stood frozen under their gazes.

"P-princess Jasmine... Princess C-Celestina..."

'Poor girl...'

The dare was only supposed to involve approaching him, but now she found herself surrounded by a prince and two princesses.

He felt pity for her—though he wasn't in any position to help.

Without warning, both Celestina and Jasmine sat down beside Kanae, leaving her sandwiched between them as she hugged her knees, clearly overwhelmed.

Azriel couldn't help but find the situation amusing.

All he had wanted was to watch from afar, and now here he was, surrounded by three beautiful girls.

Thankfully, no one else had noticed yet.

"You could've joined us, you know."

Jasmine said, glancing at him.

"Or you could've asked me to come. I would've kept you company."

Celestina nodded, agreeing with Jasmine's words.

Azriel smiled faintly, appreciating their concern.

"Thanks, but it's fine. I was enjoying watching you all have fun."

Jasmine pursed her lips before turning to the still-frightened Kanae.

"My name is Jasmine Crimson. Cadet Kanae, thank you for taking care of this idiot little brother of mine."

"Who are you calling an idiot...?"

Azriel muttered, though he was ignored.

Kanae, flustered, quickly shook her head.

"No, I don't deserve such praise... Besides, Prince Azriel was very... kind."

It wasn't like she could confess that she was there because of a dare.

She didn't want to die!

Admitting that to Jasmine, his overprotective sister, and Celestina, one of his few friends, would be a death sentence in Kanae's mind.

Azriel shifted his attention to Celestina, who was staring at him intently, making him frown.

"Is something wrong, Celestina?"

She shook her head.

"No... It's nothing. By the way, thank you for convincing Vergil to help us. Though I would've preferred it if you joined us as well."

"It's fine. No need to thank me."

Azriel replied with a soft laugh, intentionally ignoring the last part of her comment.

Celestina pursed her lips but said nothing more.

Jasmine, however, wasn't done.

"You two are friends, right? How did that happen?"

She asked, curiosity lacing her voice as she glanced between them.

Even Kanae seemed more at ease, watching the exchange closely.

Jasmine's curiosity made sense.

She had never seen Celestina and Azriel together before.

They'd barely interacted, not even enough to be called acquaintances.

Azriel glanced at Celestina, his grin widening as mischief sparked in his eyes.

She narrowed hers in suspicion, sensing trouble.

"It's a funny story, actually, dear sister." Azriel began.

Both Jasmine and Kanae leaned in slightly, their interest piqued, urging him to continue.

"You see, if you want to know how this all started, we'd have to go back to the Christmas banquet... Back then, I actually propos—"

"You idiot! Don't tell her about that!"

Celestina's voice cut him off abruptly as she slapped her hands over his mouth, her face inches from his, glaring at him with bright red cheeks.

Azriel blinked in surprise, his words muffled by her soft hands.

"That banquet is a dark history! Don't tell anyone about that day!"

Celestina demanded, her face flushed with embarrassment.

He could only nod, still wide-eyed, as the others stared at the scene in stunned silence.

Satisfied, Celestina pulled her hands away and coughed awkwardly, avoiding their gazes.

'...Soft,'

Her hands were incredibly soft, like she had never wielded a weapon, though he knew that wasn't true.

The air grew tense as Celestina's embarrassment deepened.

She had just created another "dark history" for herself, though Azriel was smart enough not to point that out.

"Well... it's good to see that the two of you are friends, at least. I'm glad."

Jasmine said, offering a faint smile.

Kanae, however, looked visibly uncomfortable, clearly feeling out of place.

No one could blame her—being surrounded by a prince and two princesses was hardly a typical situation.

Jasmine's expression softened briefly, but her eyes narrowed as she glanced at Azriel.

The silent exchange between them went unnoticed by the other two.

'You're telling me everything later.'

'Don't wanna.'

'Then I'm telling Mom about you getting drunk on your first day here.'

Azriel's lips tightened at the threat.

They had grown skilled at communicating without words, but now it seemed his sister was blackmailing him over Celestina.

'How about I take you shopping instead?'

Azriel offered, attempting to strike a deal.

Jasmine's face twisted into a mix of contemplation and frustration before she glared at him in resignation.

'Still no. I know it's about that engagement you had with her at the banquet. You're telling me everything later.'

'You knew?'

Azriel's eyes widened slightly.

'I thought Mom and Dad kept it a secret from everyone... even you.'

'Of course I knew. I'm your sister.'

Jasmine's expression carried a mix of pride and teasing.

She wasn't just anyone—she was Jasmine Crimson.

'Fine... I'll tell you after everyone goes to sleep.'

'Good.'

While the siblings exchanged this wordless conversation, Celestina and Kanae remained lost in their own thoughts, oblivious to the silent tug-of-war happening right in front of them.

After that, the atmosphere gradually returned to normal.

The tension eased as everyone began chatting casually.

Kanae, however, made her exit soon after, as if she had just escaped from the gates of hell.

The three of them exchanged amused glances at her hurried departure.

For the next hour, Azriel, Jasmine, and Celestina kept their conversation light, discussing trivial things and avoiding any serious topics.

Eventually, Celestina excused herself, heading to her tent to rest for the night.

Tomorrow was an important day—they would face the first floor's boss and prepare to descend to the second floor.

Chapter 74: The Dark King of Imperion [1]

The cadets were packing up their gear, preparing to enter the boss room.

The joyous atmosphere of the previous night had vanished, replaced by grim expressions and a tense, gloomy air.

It was no surprise—most of them were terrified, and who could blame them?

They had barely faced any battles in the void dungeon, and the entire first floor had turned into a deserted zone.

Some even speculated that it could be declared a safe zone like the fifth floor, but that was irrelevant now.

What mattered was the daunting challenge ahead—they were about to face the first boss of the void dungeon with little to no combat experience.

The tension was palpable, and it was nerve-wracking for everyone.

The only reason they hadn't panicked was that a few cadets remained calm, helping to steady the others.

Having the Princess of the Frost Clan among them reassured many, and with one of the top cadets, Vergil, offering his support, it brought some comfort.

Still, the lack of help from the Apex himself was starting to stir quiet resentment among a few.

"Are you really planning to stay out of this?"

Jasmine asked, standing beside Azriel as they watched the cadets prepare for the boss fight.

There wasn't a clear plan—no one knew much about the first-floor boss.

It was rare for a boss to change, especially on the first floor, but now, nothing seemed certain.

Even if the boss hadn't changed, little was known about it.

Information on the void dungeon, particularly regarding bosses and other key details, was strictly prohibited from being leaked.

"...I am."

"Are you sure? It would be your first time fighting a floor boss... it's quite the experience,"

Jasmine pressed, her concern evident.

But Azriel remained unmoved, his expression indifferent as he continued to watch the cadets.

"I'm sure."

"...I see."

Jasmine responded, disappointment creeping into her tone.

She glanced at his face, trying to read his thoughts, but he remained a closed book.

Even yesterday, she'd panicked when she went to check on him, only to find him absent from the tents where he was supposed to be resting.

Luckily, he had just been observing them from a distance.

But why?

Why did he always keep everyone at arm's length?

'When will you open up to me?' she thought, aching for him to finally let her in.

But she couldn't force him—she didn't want to push him away.

"...Are you disappointed?"

Azriel suddenly asked, his gaze still fixed ahead.

Jasmine's eyes widened slightly.

She bit her lip, unsure how to respond.

"Are you disappointed in me like the others? For not meeting your expectations?"

His voice was calm, but his words carried weight.

"I let you down, didn't I?"

Jasmine couldn't read him at all.

"I'm not disappointed."

She whispered.

"Liar."

His quick rebuke startled her.

She froze, unsure how to respond once again.

"I'm not..."

"Yes, you are. It's normal to be. I'm Azriel Crimson. Everyone has expectations of me. You want me to take the lead, destroy the void creatures, make everyone see me as some kind of hero. You want me to be the person who walks into that room and slays the boss on my own."

A small smile tugged at his lips, but Jasmine found herself unable to speak.

He was right—deep down, she did want that.

She wanted him to live up to his potential, to be the hero she knew he could be—her talented little brother.

He was never one to seek the spotlight, and she understood that.

But when he decided to attend the Hero Academy, she'd been thrilled.

His rise to becoming the Apex had made her even prouder.

So yes, it would be a lie to say she wasn't disappointed that he didn't get involved now.

"The Unworthy Prince."

Jasmine's heart froze at hearing those words leave his mouth.

"The most famous title given to me..."

"...."

It wasn't the title itself that shocked her—she knew people whispered about him online, even though slander against the children of the great clans was technically illegal.

The internet was a wild place, especially in this age.

What stunned her was that he acknowledged it, that he spoke of it.

She had always assumed he didn't care what others said about him.

Afraid of what he might say next, his following words left her speechless.

"I think there isn't a title more fitting for me than that."

Celestina stood before the assembled cadets, their backs rigid, the tension in the air palpable.

Many of them looked hesitant, even scared, and she couldn't blame them—it was time to face the floor boss.

She had waited a full day, and still, nothing had happened.

No attacks, no intervention from the instructors.

There was no longer any room for delay.

Glancing one last time at the group, she turned toward the massive gates ahead.

Her footsteps echoed down the corridor, syncing with her heartbeat, which seemed to drum louder in her chest.

She was scared too.

But fear was good. Fear kept her alive.

Standing before the towering gate, she reached out and placed her right hand on its dust-covered surface.

The moment she did, the ground trembled beneath them.

Dust cascaded from the engravings as blue light began to fill the grooves, glowing brighter with every second.

The tremors intensified, and slowly, under the astonished gazes of the cadets, the massive gates began to part.

'This is it...'

There was no turning back now.

Today, she would slay her first floor boss.

As the gates finally opened, Celestina took a step forward, her footsteps once again echoing ominously through the corridor as she entered the boss room.

The cadets, not wanting to be left behind, followed their leader.

But when they stepped inside, what greeted them froze each one of them in place.

Before them loomed an enormous chamber, its vastness swallowed by shadows.

At its heart lay a massive, circular arena, the only path to it being the narrow one directly ahead.

The edges of the platform dropped away into an endless abyss, a void so deep it felt as though it could swallow both time and light itself.

The walls surrounding the chamber mirrored the ancient gates they had passed, adorned with dust-laden engravings.

Faded, yet strangely beautiful, the intricate designs whispered of another world—one touched by a master's hand.

It was otherworldly, as though the chamber itself was a forgotten relic of divine craftsmanship.

But it was not the artistry that held them motionless.

No, what froze them in place was what sat at the very center of the arena.

A throne.

And upon that throne sat something.

Or someone.

A lone figure, draped in onyx armor so polished it seemed to ripple like liquid, catching the dim light in ominous, gleaming waves.

The craftsmanship was so exquisite, so flawless, that it struck both awe and terror into their hearts.

A dark, inscrutable helmet masked the figure's face.

Through the narrow vertical slit in the helm, two glowing crimson orbs stared out—like burning embers in the void.

Yet... it did not move.

It did not seem to be alive.

It did not breathe.

It did not see.

It simply sat there.

Staring.

Straight at them—or perhaps through them—bound by chains to its throne.

It was...

The Dark King of Imperion.

Chapter 75: The Dark King of Imperion [2]

A floor shift is one of the many strange phenomena within the void dungeon.

When a floor changes in a way that defies its usual structure, it's called a floor shift.

These shifts can be temporary or, in rare cases, permanent, though the latter almost never occurs.

What changes during a floor shift is unpredictable.

It could alter the terrain, the void creatures inhabiting the floor, or even the floor boss itself, which in some cases may become significantly stronger.

But why does this happen?

No one truly knows.

Some theorize the void dungeon is a living, sentient void creature, reacting to the intruders who invade it.

Others believe that a floor shift is a sign of the void dungeon's anger, a retaliation for the disturbance.

There have even been instances where a higher-level boss spawns on a lower floor, seemingly to eliminate the humans that have ventured too far.

The floor shift that Azriel and the others encountered was even more irregular.

The first floor had become nearly deserted after a single wave of prowlers, the path to the boss room unnervingly easy.

And now, as they stood before the floor boss...

It was clear this wouldn't be as simple as their journey here.

No—the void dungeon was far from merciful.

The Dark King of Imperion—a title given to the first-floor boss of the void dungeon.

While no footage existed of it, stories passed down by countless survivors and witnesses kept its reputation alive.

A void creature resembling a knight forged from pure darkness, it was classified as a Grade 1 Beast.

At least, it should have been.

Azriel narrowed his eyes, peering into its mana core.

'A Grade 2 Monster...?'

It was absurd.

The boss of the first floor was as strong as a third-floor boss, yet it remained unmoving, seated upon a massive obsidian throne that matched its armor.

Thick, rusted silver chains bound its legs, torso, and arms to the throne, like a prisoner shackled to its own dark fate.

A chained dark knight, its presence suffocating.

Yet it was called a king.

'A Grade 2 monster, and that armor...'
