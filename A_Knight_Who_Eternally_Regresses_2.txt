Rem had once broken the jaw of a superior officer over a disagreement in his previous squad. Was it his place to say such things? While Rem was a benefactor to Enkrid, he wasn't exactly popular with other squads, especially his former 1st Squad who glared at him as if they wished he were dead. After all, he had fractured their Squad Leader's jaw.
Enkrid didn't argue. Arguing wouldn't change anything. It was a waste of time. Rather than arguing, it was better to focus on mastering the ‘Heart of the Beast.’ Besides learning from Rem, Enkrid had plenty to do.
"Especially with those 1st Squad bastards, it feels even more repulsive."
Sure, let's go with that.
Seeing Enkrid not respond, Rem stopped walking.
"Why?"
"Normally, you'd have something to say by now. Weren't you the one who always said it's not my place to break a jaw, or that if you can't get along, it's better not to look at each other at all?"
Normally, that would be the case. If Enkrid was not criticizing the jaw-breaking, then he was advising to avoid interaction if there's no chance of getting along. Better to keep them apart than to encourage conflict, as Enkrid believed while leading the eccentric ‘Four Four Four Squad.’
"I have nothing to say."
Enkrid cut him off. Rem scratched the back of his head.
"Today's really odd."
They went to eat breakfast and then found an open space outside the barracks for training. Although training on a battlefield might seem out of place, Enkrid was accustomed to this routine. For those who knew him, it wasn't anything special. Passersby didn't give them much attention either.
Thus, the teaching of the 'Heart of the Beast' began anew.
"...Have you secretly learned from someone else? But that shouldn't be possible."
"I just repeated what I learned."
"Can training alone really lead to this?"
Another death was just another experience. Enkrid found it easier to focus than before. Seeing this, Rem sent him a curious look but then shrugged it off with a "Fine, then."
"In my opinion, Squad Leader, you have talent if you can do this much."
Rem threw a similar comment as yesterday. Talent, if only that were true.
Just before, Enkrid had failed to dodge Rem's axe, which halted just in front of his throat. Just a flick of the wrist away from leaving a long scar on his neck, it was dangerously close.
"That was a close call."
Rem chuckled, seemingly proud of Enkrid's progress. There was a hint of satisfaction in his laughter. Enkrid felt it too.
"What kind of trick allows you to swing an axe like that?"
That axe swing just now. Rem's axe was even faster than the thrusts that had killed him several times. The axe blade nearly touched the skin of his neck, a mere blink away. In fact, Enkrid didn't even blink, but he still missed the movement of the axe blade.
"Hm, talent?"
Enkrid thought Rem was really annoying at that moment. He always was like that.
"If training could make everyone good with a sword, would there be anyone bad at it?"
Rem laughed heartily. Enkrid, who had just read satisfaction on Rem's face, now realized that Rem enjoyed teasing him.
A strange guy indeed.
Well, was there anyone in this squad who wasn't odd?
"What if you train more? What if you put in more effort? What if you swing your sword even when you should be sleeping?"
Enkrid asked reflexively. It was a dilemma he had long harbored. Should one give up if they lack talent? Enkrid didn't give up. Instead of surrendering, he chose to advance.
What did he have if he decided to march forward?
Nothing but the will to keep moving, even if it meant taking only a quarter step while the so-called geniuses took ten.
"If you really think that's not odd, then you've become serious, haven't you?"
Rem put his axe back on his belt and said.
"No."
"Squad Leader."
Rem called out to Enkrid without a hint of laughter.
After a brief silence, Rem spoke,
"People die if they don't sleep."
He was shaking. Rem couldn't hold back his laughter anymore and burst out laughing right after his statement. That was his response to what would happen if Enkrid kept swinging his sword even in his sleep.
"Get lost."
Enkrid gave him the universal finger gesture, raising his middle finger. Rem, still chuckling, suggested they go have lunch. Enkrid didn't beg for more lessons. You can't get full with just one spoonful. He knew this all too well.
After lunch, Enkrid reviewed his own swordsmanship.
The basic sword techniques of stabbing, slashing, and swinging. After the basics, he learned the Vallen style mercenary swordsmanship. It wasn't shabby.
He had traveled far and spent a good amount of money on it. It wasn't something you could learn for a few silver coins.
Vallen Style Mercenary swordsmanship.
It was named after Vallen, who was quite renowned in the mercenary world, though he was from a knight's level.
If it had to be categorized, it would belong to the illusionary sword style. Enkrid didn't know how Vallen originally used it, but he had internalized a few techniques in his own way.
Enkrid devoted himself to this style.
'Death brings a new day, but what remains in the body doesn't disappear.'
The 'Heart of the Beast' wasn't learned in the mind but absorbed by the body. That meant what remained in his body stayed there.
He pushed his body to its limits. His palms, deeply calloused from years of training, cracked open again from swinging the sword. Normally, soldiers don't use swords. Spears are their main weapon. It was a special privilege for Enkrid because he was the Squad Leader.
Enkrid didn't want to let go of his sword.
He trained repeatedly. His grip ached, but he endured. His stomach felt raw from undigested food, but he endured. He primed every single sense, from the tips of his toes to his fingertips.
Illusionary swordsmanship is about deception. It encourages using whatever means necessary to deceive the opponent. A few techniques of Vallen style swordsmanship had already spread throughout the mercenary world.
For example, pretending to fall and then stabbing the opponent. It's not despicable. What's despicable about doing whatever it takes to survive? If someone claimed a knight wouldn't do such things, Enkrid wouldn't argue. Everyone has their own values and he has his own.
The time allowed was half a day. His legs didn't give out. If they had, it would have made a mockery of his daily physical training. Enkrid's legs were strong.
"Having a sturdy body is indeed an advantage."
Rem commented as Enkrid returned. Just then, a messenger had come and left. It was the sixth repeat of today, and just by looking at the sky, Enkrid could roughly tell the flow of time.
"Twenty years of training went into this body."
Enkrid replied nonchalantly and moved back to the squad area.
"Make sure your sturdy body doesn't end up being just a training dummy for them."
Just before the battle began, Rem chuckled again.
"I'll take over the duty tomorrow."
Jaxon added from the side. One seemed to be mocking him. The other seemed determined not to be on kitchen duty two days in a row. Well, whichever way they meant it, both seemed to wish for his safe return.
"See you later."
The sixth day began and Enkrid killed the enemies more effortlessly than on the fifth day.
The first attacker tripped and hit on the back of his head with the edge of a shield. The second was tricked with a sword feint before being stabbed.
Vallen style swordsmanship.
These were not commonly known techniques in the mercenary world, but were acquired through extensive effort and money.
The flickering sword tip itself was a mirage, confusing the opponent's sight.
He applied what he had learned, and it was effective. He felt rewarded. The joy of growth, the sense of fulfillment filled his heart once more. The repeated days did not bring about just insignificant achievements.
Enkrid didn't take his repeated resurrections lightly. On the contrary, he was more intense, more focused, more immersed. He had always harbored the desire and ambition to seize any opportunity.
Enkrid lived up to that. He cut down, struck, and toppled enemies. The repeated battles offered him unique experiences.
"Heart of the Beast."
He saw things he hadn't noticed the previous days. Soon, it was time for Bell to fall again. Fighting in the same place every day meant he always saw Bell. One cannot simply retreat from the front lines or move elsewhere on a whim. Such actions are tantamount to suicide. Changing one's position on the battlefield at will is not an easy task.
'My skills aren't at that level.'
Enkrid knew himself well.
Though he had more leeway, he wasn't about to charge through enemy lines or take risks akin to gambling. Moreover, he couldn't anticipate the skilled archer's arrows in advance.
Thump!
Bell's head burst again.
"Damn."
He had tried to save him this time, but failed again. Enkrid immediately ducked. As if on cue, an arrow whizzed overhead. A whooshing sound lingered in his ears. It was a skillful dodge, as if he had anticipated it.
"Seems like you have a good sense today?"
Rem, who had approached unnoticed, commented.
"Go, then. Take the head of the bastard who shot those arrows."
"Was planning to. Since you're in good shape, take care of yourself."
Rem departed. Enkrid encountered the skilled soldier with the thrusts again. And Enkrid failed again. This time, he dodged the club from the soldier behind him, but another nearby threw a throwing axe.
It was infuriating.
The morning of the seventh day dawned.
"I put the bug in."
When he told Rem,
"Have you gone mad?"
"No, I'm not crazy. Keeping your mind calm in such situations, that's part of 'Heart of the Beast,' right?"
"Hm?"
"Teach me."
The day began again.
Rem hesitated, then agreed.
He learned, practiced, and swung his sword.
This time, he didn't even try to save Bell. To save him, he needed to anticipate the arrow, which he couldn't do. It was all up to luck.
How did Rem dodge those arrows? Enkrid wondered as he moved.
He died from the thrust again.
"Mercy."
That damn mercy.
He died. And so, the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth... Even after more than a hundred deaths, Enkrid kept repeating his day of death.
Chapter 6: His Hands Should Have Torn
Each day that got repeated was spent valuably by Enkrid. He never wasted any of them.
'I'm just average.’
When it comes to swordsmanship, he wan't be a prodigy or a genius, let alone a natural-born talent.
After the eighth failure, Enkrid thought,
'I tried to finish a meal with just one forkful.'
Far from being a genius, he was not even a prodigy or a talent. Enkrid divided his tasks,
'Take half a step at a time.'
There was nothing tedious. The repetitive days, along with the growing skill. It was like an addiction. Enkrid found this situation immensely enjoyable.
'There are many good points.'
Above all, the best part was being able to constantly experience real battles and those experiences were intense, causing him to risk life itself. Enkrid made full use of it, making the most of his days. He trained the Heart of the Beast and learned new sword techniques until he went to the battlefield.
Along with that, the repeating time also made him memorize the events happening around him. The gambling at the neighboring barracks during breakfast was a good example.
"Damn it! You cheated, didn't you?"
"Cheating? You bastard, I'm just lucky."
A familiar morning scene. It wasn't cheating. Having seen it several times, he knew. The dice always rolled the same numbers, and Enkrid was aware of it.
Passing by, he spent another day. Repeating. The recurring real battles broadened Enkrid's perspective. More precisely, having plenty of time to think broadened his range of thought.
'There's no need to specifically deflect an arrow to save Bell.'
That's something only a first-class mercenary could do. Enkrid gave up cleanly, and by doing so, he could save Bell.
Thump!
All he needed was a sturdier shield. The arrow lodged into the round shield. No matter how skilled an archer, it's impossible to pierce the skull of a soldier hidden behind a shield.
"Where the hell did you pop out from?"
Bell, who had fallen, asked with wide eyes.
"How long do you plan to roll around on the ground? Get up quickly, won't you?"
After roughly wiping away the sweat with the back of his hand, Enkrid kicked Bell's buttocks. Having his buttocks patted, Bell headed back into the battlefield again.
'By saving him here, will I be able to see this bastard's face tomorrow?'
Who knows. He had just chosen this as the first point. Slicing through the battlefield to save Bell was the small goal Enkrid had set. He achieved it on the twenty-fifth repetition.
"Damn. Mother Superior's got nothing on you. When you have time, save me too. Instead of saving some other unit's scum."
It was routine for Rem to suddenly pop out from behind and spout nonsense. Every time he saved Bell, he would spit out crazy words with a different repertoire, and each time, Enkrid would respond in kind.
Mother referred to a nun in charge of a monastery.
"You're excommunicated. You look too filthy."
The monastery doesn't accept anyone who's not a believer. Excommunication means being told to leave Mother's embrace, in other words, being kicked out of the monastery. The joke was quite highbrow for a conversation with Rem.
"What a filthy world we live in, discriminating based on looks, ptooey."
As always, Rem left without being deterred. He was off to catch some guy with eagle eyes, he didn't need to say it for Enkrid to know.
Even after repeating the day about fifty times, Enkrid still couldn't defeat the enemy soldier that stabbed him. He managed to block the attack several times by luck, but at that moment, someone would jump out from the side and smash his head with a hammer.
"There's no need to drag this out."
Said the guy who smashed Enkrid's head.
Enkrid didn't even know how he got hit. Suddenly everything spun, and the ground was rushing up to meet him. He didn't have the mind to shake his head. He just felt a sticky liquid trickling down his face. When he somewhat regained his senses, he realized he was on his knees, having dropped his sword.
"This must be painful, mercy."
Then a blade pierced his throat, forcing him to flail in agony. The blade digging into his neck. An unfamiliar pain surged through his body. It felt like his throat was being gouged with a red-hot iron, scrambling his brain. Dying, Enkrid blinked. The blood in his eyes dyed the world red.
Beyond that red-drenched vision, the red eyes of the enemy soldier wielding the sword could be seen through the helmet's visor. They weren't actually red, but they appeared so at the moment. A shallow thrill lingered in the enemy's eyes. Having died so many times, he saw all sorts of things. It was also thanks to the heart of a trained beast.
'What a pervert.'
It wasn't the act of granting mercy that was the goal, but the thrill of killing that led to his death. The bastard always thrust the blade into the neck and slowly pulled it out. He might have been getting aroused by feeling the last breath of others through the sword.
Even realizing this, Enkrid remained calm. Having surpassed countless moments of death, a natural boldness settled in. It was only natural.
And then,
"What, are you secretly enjoying a tryst somewhere?"
On the eighty-sixth time, Rem suddenly said. Enkrid frowned at Rem's words.
What kind of nonsense is this?
"What?"
"The Heart of the Beast, you learned that from me, but there's no way you could have trained it to this extent by yourself."
The axe blade stopped a mere finger's width from Enkrid's eye. If it had come any closer, the wind pressure alone might have damaged the cornea. Thanks to that, Enkrid could only see half of Rem's face beyond the finely sharpened axe blade, but even in such a moment, his breathing didn't falter.
The strength brought by the Heart of the Beast. The boldness that allowed him to endure even when he knew pain was coming. Enkrid, looking beyond the axe blade at Rem's questioning eyes, thought,
'So this can happen too.'
By repeating the day, the Heart of the Beast was trained, so it must have been a ridiculous situation for its original teacher. He only realized it now because Rem was the type of squad member who didn't care about the details. Rem might talk a lot of nonsense, but he wasn't the type to question things.
Except when it came to the Heart of the Beast, since he taught it himself. Enkrid didn't make any lame excuses. There was no need for that. After thinking it over for the day, he could just make adjustments on the next repeating day.
Thump, Rem pulled back his axe. Enkrid's view cleared. Not even a scratch was left on his face. Rem handled the heavy axe as if it were his own hand. Pulling back the axe, Rem scratched his head with the end of the axe handle.
"I don't get it, I was wondering if you learned from someone else besides me."
Even as he spoke, his face seemed to question the plausibility of his words. Enkrid was the Fourth-Fourth Squad leader, and this damned squad wouldn't listen to anyone but him. After learning the Heart of the Beast from Rem, Enkrid had never left the squad. So, even if he wanted to, he wouldn't have had the time to learn.
Rem watched Enkrid closely.
Unless he learned secretly while on night duty... No, that, too, was implausible.
"Your swordplay is good enough that you could die this afternoon and it'd be 'Ah, I see', but how can only your heart toughen up?"
What a thing to say. He would die this afternoon. Rem didn't know anything, but his words inadvertently hit home.
"I've survived death about eighty times."
Enkrid answered vaguely, thinking. He couldn't learn more about the Heart of the Beast from Rem. No excuse could perfectly clear the doubts of this man from the barbarian tribe.
'I can't exactly say, "I learned from you every day as the days repeated, and through dying, I became like this."'
But he could gloss over it. Rem wasn't that fastidious. Indeed, it was so. There was no need to spend time on it.
"Let's say that's true. Sometimes the goddess of luck unwittingly drops a coin."
It's a common saying for a soldier who survives by a fluke of unforeseen coincidences. Does that apply even when mastering such a secret technique? If not, so what. If Rem was satisfied, that was enough.
"Thanks to that, it's more interesting than before. My skills have improved. What have you been up to in secret?"
"Something painfully close to death."
Enkrid wasn't lying.
"Right, a man should have some secrets. That's what makes a man. You know me."
Rem didn't care about this either. Just like before, he picked up his axe and said nothing more.
"Another round?"
Rem, holding the axe, asked. Enkrid silently picked up his sword.
If saving the fallen soldier Bell was the first goal, the second and last goal was to kill the man who felt a thrill with every kill. He was well-prepared for it.
On the hundred and first day, it was time for a duel with Rem.
Enkrid flexed his muscles as he pulled back his arm. He stretched his left foot forward, aiming to step on Rem's foot.
Rem quickly withdrew his foot, and seeing that, Enkrid, instead of stepping on Rem's foot, twisted his waist around with his left foot planted on the ground and swung the sword with all his might.
The foot was a feint. It was a move anticipating Rem's retreat. He exerted force in his muscles and swung his sword. For a moment, Enkrid saw Rem's arm whip around unrealistically. So unreal, even the axe in his hand seemed to bend.
Clang!
It all happened in an instant. The axe blade bent and then shot up like lightning and it struck the sword Enkrid was holding.
The sword flew upward.
Slipping from Enkrid's hand, the soaring sword spun in the air and then landed with a thud on the ground. The sound was made by the sword blade accidentally hitting a rock on the ground. The rolling sword was visible to the eye.
"Let's see."
Rem abruptly approached and grabbed Enkrid's wrist. The shock of dropping the sword made his hand tremble. Rem looked at Enkrid's hand, clicked his tongue, and said,
"This should have bled a bit."
"What?"
Swinging the axe so recklessly and then saying such a thing.
"That stabbing was good, really good, but it was lacking. I can't explain it well, but your grip should have been torn apart. You shouldn’t have just dropped the sword.”
"Don't let go of the sword even in death?"
Enkrid raised his voice, a phrase he had heard countless times from his swordsmanship teachers. Living through each repeating day is a burdensome task. Enkrid remembered each day's beginning a bit differently. He had always had a better-than-average memory since he was young. Until now, that memory hadn't been of much help in swordsmanship, but now it was helpful especially when reminiscing about what he learned from his teachers.
That's what he was doing now, reminiscing as he spoke.
"What kind of nonsense is that? If necessary, throw the sword at the opponent's face. Eh, ah, let's take it easy. That stabbing earlier, where were you aiming?"
Rem said, blowing out his breath. Enkrid couldn't easily respond. This stabbing was his secret technique. He had stolen it by being stabbed in the neck by enemy soldiers more than a hundred times. From the overall posture, the position of the feet, the shift of the center of gravity when using the sword, the movement of the muscles, the direction of the toes, to the shape of the hand holding the sword. He had stolen and imitated everything.
"That sword strike earlier, it looked decent, but, damn, it's hard to explain. Look at this."
Rem let the axe hang down and drew a large circle on the dirt floor. It was about the size of a human head.
"Let's say our target is somewhere around here."
Saying that, Rem rotated the axe above the circle and then made a dot with a stab.
"But in reality, we're going to go here."
At first, Enkrid wondered what he was talking about but perhaps the time spent learning from swordsmanship teachers wasn't in vain. Despite the crappy explanation, it was like a pickled fruit that settled well on the tongue, clear and understandable.
'The target point.'
What was embedded in the stabbing he had just performed? Did he want to be praised for doing well? Did he want to be acknowledged for having even a speck of talent because he imitated well? What's the point? What is a sword for?
To cut and stab the opponent, a weapon for killing. Especially stabbing, it's a basic technique in swordsmanship that aims for one point. It's often used in rapier swordsmanship. He had heard that there were knights who used a thin blade for stabbing through armor gaps as their primary weapon.
"I really can't explain any better. I assumed I would naturally dodge or block, so you dropped the sword so easily but that stabbing earlier should have been decisive. Just like, 'I'll stab you. You can't dodge.' You had to show that convincingly."
Even after speaking, Rem was reevaluating whether he had explained properly. Being a guy who plays at his own pace, he was terrible at explaining. However, if the other party somewhat understood, then this explanation, akin to a neighbor's dog barking, could be considered excellent. Thus, for Enkrid, it was an excellent explanation.
'I lacked confidence in my sword.'
The stabbing earlier was like that of a third-rate mercenary. On the hundred and first day, Enkrid realized,
And until the hundred and twenty-third day, he performed a full-power stabbing,
On the hundred and twenty-fourth day, Rem's lightning-fast axe swing tore his grip apart. Not just torn, but it exploded. Blood dripped down his grip.
Enkrid laughed at that. Because he had achieved what he wanted.
"Have you completely lost your mind? There's nothing more dangerous on the battlefield than a mad ally, you know? Why are you still laughing?"
Seeing that, Rem showed a rare look of confusion, but Enkrid couldn't stop the laughter coming out.
"Fuck, stop laughing. You look like a madman, you know?"
Rem said, witnessing the events of the hundred and twenty-fourth 'today'.
Chapter 7: Three of a Kind
Unable to maintain his laughter any longer, Enkrid stopped smiling.
Seeing this, Rem caught Enkrid's wrist and skillfully wrapped it with the bandages he pulled out from his belongings.
"Stay behind me today. With your hand like this, you're just asking for trouble. If you got this from sparring, the Squad Leader bastard will throw a fit."
"It's fine."
"What do you mean 'it's fine'? If you go into battle with that hand, you'll die. Is suicide your future ambition? If so, I won't stop you."
He wasn't wrong. Going into battle with his hand in such a state would indeed be asking for death, but to Enkrid, it wasn't a significant issue. If he died, it would just be one more death.
After death, the hundred and twenty-fifth morning would dawn.
'It's not tedious.'
As it would mean that he would end the repetitive cycle of today. His time hadn't been spent solely on honing his swordsmanship. During the one hundred and twenty-four days of repetition, he'd also devised strategies for surviving 'today.'
People say that an ordinary soldier returning from the first battle alive was like picking up a coin dropped by the goddess of luck. If you were not exceptionally talented, luck played a significant role in staying alive. Enkrid figured he'd need such luck a few times to avoid death.
'But I can't rely solely on luck.'
He didn't need to. He knew what would happen on the battlefield, especially around him. Therefore, he could prepare and he could be ready.
On the hundred and twenty-fourth time, Enkrid died again, impaled by a thrust. His palms were in such bad shape that he couldn't even properly parry the sword. Still, not wanting to waste even a single day, he memorized the enemy's thrust. He regulated his breath and held on until the very end. And he managed to accomplish it.
"That must hurt. What mercy."
He endured the searing pain of the blade through his neck, hearing the enemy soldier's voice. Something caught in his throat, and right before he died, he spat it out— it was a broken molar. A consequence of clenching his teeth too hard in pain.
Yes, it wasn't tedious. Even the repetition of today was valuable, and thus, enjoyable.
But no matter what reason he attached to it,
'I don't want to die.'
Dying couldn't possibly be enjoyable. Especially not at the hands of a perverted bastard who reveled in others' pain. If he could end it, he would. The moment he realized he was trapped in the cycle of a day, Enkrid resolved to do so.
And then.
Clang! Clang! Clang!
The hundred and twenty-fifth morning dawned.
***
Getting up, Enkrid first shook out Rem's boots.
"What are you doing? Those are mine."
"I know, they stink. If we throw them at the enemy like this, we could take out fifty of them with just the smell."
"Judging by your pissy mood this morning, did you have a nice dream or something?"
Thud— a bug fell out as he shook Rem's boots. Enkrid crushed it under his foot.
"Saw it go in this morning."
"...Thanks for that."
Rem chuckled and slipped his boots on. Leaving Rem behind, Enkrid pushed aside the tent flap and stepped outside. Dawn was just breaking, blending the blue of early morning with the yellow of the rising sun. The guards on duty were busy stirring the pot, while the soldiers who had just woken up either grumbled while rubbing their eyes or quietly went about their tasks.
"Damn it, stop banging. My head's gonna split open."
"That's what you get for guzzling down booze last night."
It was from the tent behind.
"Will you shut it? If they find out about the booze, it's disciplinary action."
"Bloody hell."
The exchange was between the guard on duty and a comrade who had overindulged in alcohol the previous night. Listening to this, Enkrid glanced back briefly to catch a glimpse of the face of the soldier who had drunk too much. He was a Decurion from another unit and a Squad Leader. That chap had a good mother.
On the sixty-sixth day, Enkrid had spoken to this fellow just to make the day memorable, pretending to be chummy with him for no reason.
"Aren't you on morning duty?"
"You do it."
While Enkrid was checking the back, he suddenly said to Rem who had followed him out.
"Why should I?"
"You could do it just this once. I've done it for you more than five times."
"You're petty, counting stuff like that?"
"Yeah, only yours."
"Why only mine?"
"Because you're annoying, that's why."
During the hundred and twenty-five times, Enkrid had never allowed a single scratch on that bastard Rem. Not that he harbored any resentment. If anything, he felt gratitude.
Anyway, Rem would do it. Assigning morning duty to Rem was the pattern that resulted in the highest survival probability and best condition to start the day among the repeatedly experienced todays.
"Fine, damn it. I'll do it."
Half-heartedly moving around to warm up, the chill of the morning air didn't make him shiver. Twisting and turning his body, Enkrid didn't stray far from the front of the tent. One by one, the Squad members started to come out.
The first was Jaxon, a member known for his diligence. Jaxon greeted him with a nod as their eyes met. Enkrid responded with a slight nod. After a few more members came out, Enkrid caught the last one who appeared, his eyes still half-closed.
"Big Eyes."
"Huh?"
Big Eyes was his nickname, his real name being Kraiss Olman. A Squad member with a delicate appearance. And the only one among the Fourth-Fourth Troublemaker Squad members, known for being a collection of troublemakers, whose combat skills were below average.
More precisely, he was someone Enkrid could beat to a pulp.
"Yawn, why so early in the morning? Early wake-up is torture for a high-class resource like me."
Yawning wide, Kraiss spoke. His face was still smeared with sleep, not a drop of water on it, yet it was quite handsome. The sort that would attract those interested in men.
"I need you to get me a few items."
Kraiss tilted his head at Enkrid's request, puzzled since this wasn't typical of him.
"Cigarettes? Or booze? Can't do women. Even I can't bring them here at a time like this."
Kraiss was the go-to guy for anything illicit within the unit.
"Do I look like I'd ask for women?"
"No. So, what do you need?"
"Five throwing knives, oil-treated leather and a large needle, deerskin gloves, and lastly, about ten white hellebore flowers and a handful of alum."
Enkrid gestured with his hands to show the size of the leather he needed. It was enough to wrap around an adult man's torso.
"...What on earth are you planning with such an odd assortment?"
"That's for me to know. Can you get them or not?"
Kraiss paused for a moment, looking at Enkrid, then nodded.
"There's nothing I can't get. But even for the Squad Leader, nothing comes for free, you know?"
"How much?"
"Seventeen silver coins."
The guy's a rip-off. Five throwing knives would cost one or two silver coins at the blacksmith's. Granted, if steel prices spiked, it might go over three coins, but that was generally the case. And whatever Kraiss would bring wouldn't be purely made of steel anyway. Still, he'd likely fetch knives that were somewhat usable. Good quality leather could be expensive, but it's not like he'd be bringing material from a renowned workshop.
The only items that might really cost something were the needle and the deerskin gloves. Even being generous, that would be three silver coins at most. White hellebore flowers could be picked up for a few pennies in the village. Alum could also be obtained without much expense if there was a leather workshop nearby.
Enkrid was quite discerning in these matters, but he didn't argue. Firstly, because they were within the military camp, these items would be hard to obtain if not through Kraiss. Secondly, the ambiguous price of seventeen coins suggested it was probably a fair asking price by Kraiss's standards.
There was another reason, too.
"I can get them right after breakfast, right?"
"Are you implying I should skip breakfast for this?"
"You hardly eat well anyway."
"Well, that's true. But, um, I hear the Squad Leader might find this a bit short?"
Kraiss made a circle with his thumb and index finger.
"I don't have it now."
There were times he saved up his salary, but recently he had spent it all on a new sword. He was indeed penniless at the moment. He would receive his salary after the battle, but asking for it now would label him a deserter.
"See, this puts me in a tight spot."
At Kraiss's words, Enkrid smiled. It was the kind of ease only someone with a solid backup plan could show.
"Just lend me five copper coins."
Kraiss usually didn't trust people easily, but if the person in question was Enkrid, it was a different story.
'After all, he's the Squad Leader.'
The Enkrid he had observed over time wasn't one to engage in folly. Above all, wasn't he the one who had saved his life?
Kraiss handed over five copper coins to Enkrid. Clutching the jingling coins, Enkrid headed straight to the adjacent tent. Inside, he saw a group who had started a game early in the morning. It was a dice game table joined by the last watch of the night and a few who preferred gambling over sleep. The surprised eyes that saw Enkrid soon recognized him and expressed curiosity.
"What's this? Isn't this the noble lord of the Fourth-Fourth Squad?"
"Quite the early bird today."
Kraiss, witnessing this, was impressed. He disliked gambling. Not only did he detest getting fleeced by swindlers, but he also hated the idea of leaving his hard-earned money to chance, whether to multiply it or lose it.
Multiplying would be great, but once you get a taste of it, it's easy to get hooked. And losing meant watching your money bag vanish into thin air.
To Kraiss, gambling was a fool's game. Yet, Enkrid joined in.
"Mind if I join?"
"Here?"
It was the night watchman of the adjacent tent. He rolled his eyes, glanced at his gambling buddies, then nodded.
"Sure, why not."
A sucker is always welcome anywhere. As Enkrid was about to squat down, Kraiss grabbed his collar.
"You're going to throw away my five copper coins here?"
His eyes were crusty, but they shone brightly as they looked at Enkrid.
'He must have made quite a few girls cry.'
Enkrid thought to himself as he pushed Kraiss's wrist away.
"If I've borrowed it, it's now my money."
With that, Enkrid secured his spot. The gamblers shuffled around to make room for him.
"Do you know how to play dice?"
A soldier, rolling dice made of pig bones in a wooden cup, asked.
"If the same number comes up, it's double. Bet on higher or lower numbers, and you get what you bet on, right?"
He had glimpsed it over someone's shoulder, but having seen it a hundred and twenty-five times, it was impossible not to know. There were three dice in total. The sum was eighteen. So, you just had to call a number higher or lower than nine.
The guy sitting in the middle was the dealer. He rolled the dice, and the rest placed their bets.
"Let's start with the first round then."
It was just a quick game before breakfast. The stakes weren't high. The minimum bet was five copper coins, and the maximum was two silver coins. Enkrid bet his five copper coins.
"Lower."
"Higher."
"Lower."
"Lower."
"Higher."
"Higher."
"Lower."
In less than ten minutes, Enkrid had two silver coins in his hand. The thrill of dice games lies in their speed. It's all about the quick hits in a short amount of time.
And so they played.
Initially, Enkrid memorized the numbers for fun. Would the dice always roll the same numbers every day? Even though the days repeated, things around him tended to change slightly.
So he knew.
The dice always rolled the same numbers.
"Looks like the goddess of luck didn't just drop a coin but gave a kiss as well."
When the coins in Enkrid's hand exceeded ten silver coins, the soldier acting as the dealer commented.
"Isn't this cheating?"
Normally, the comment would come from the soldier sitting next to the dealer, but the dealer spoke up.
"Cheat? I'm just lucky today. Feels like the goddess is whispering in my ear."
Enkrid shrugged off the suspicious glances. They couldn't really argue. After all, the dealer was the one rolling the dice. Even if they had conspired, this would be too much. Besides, halfway through, they subtly started betting alongside Enkrid, profiting from it.
"Cheat? You're the one rolling the dice."
"Thought you might be casting some damned spell."
"Wouldn't dream of it."
"On other days, even when losing like mad, they kept playing, no stopping for bad luck."
A soldier who made a bit of money thanks to Enkrid chuckled. The dealer acknowledged it and suggested a few more rounds before concluding.
"Let's make this the last one. We're running out of time."
Breakfast time was approaching. Enkrid rolled the ten silver coins in his hand. He started with five copper coins and ended up with this. It was all the dealer's money.
"That was fun. For the last round, how about ten silver coins? I'd like to clean up and leave."
The maximum bet was usually five silver coins. At that, the dealer frowned. Given today's accuracy, there was no reason to agree.
"Then I'll bet on triples and leave."
Enkrid spoke before the dealer could respond. What were the odds of all three dice showing the same number? The soldier rolling the dice had rarely seen such an outcome in his life, and never in an actual game. He'd only seen it while messing around alone.
So, to him, Enkrid's bet seemed like a joke, essentially saying he was willing to lose all the silver he had won. At least, that's how it sounded to him.
Chuckle.
Kraiss poked Enkrid's back from behind. Moving his mouth , Kraiss said,
'Are you crazy?'
No, not at all. Enkrid wasn't crazy.
"Triples for ten silver coins."
"...Fine."
Rattle!
The soldier spun the dice and set them down with a clatter, just in case softly rolling them might lead to any mishap.
"Let's see."
The dealer, with a mix of anticipation and a smile, opened the cup.
"...Wow, fuck."
"The goddess of luck must have blessed you, truly."
"Damn, is this even possible?"
Everyone was astonished, except for Enkrid. Three of a kind. The dice showed the same number.
Chapter 8: Snake, Alcohol, Flower, Knife
It was only a superficial reason to not want to die. Enkrid, repeating 'today' over and over, felt a different kind of fear. The fear that he might settle for this, that once today passed, such an opportunity might never come again. The desire to stop right here. That desire was a terror to Enkrid.
'Was this really what I wanted?'
To settle for today is to lead a life of obsolescence. A life that cannot advance. It is only natural for humans to look forward to tomorrow. Moreover, Enkrid was a human who dreamed of tomorrow with his modest talents. There was a logical and valid reason for that.
'I've learned all there is to learn.'
Continual training here wouldn't yield much more. If that’s the case, it was time to move towards tomorrow.
'What happens if I survive?'
Would this just end? He pondered over it countless times. To put it simply, he didn't know. He didn't know what would happen after surviving.
'If I can move forward.'
Let's move forward.
Wasn't it a life he had lived forever? More than anything, Enkrid needed certainty. Could he truly face tomorrow with what he had gained by repeating today? It was unknown. Hence, he was challenging it. A challenger's mindset was everyday life for him. Today would be a long day. He would have to utilize everything he had accumulated.
"How did you do it?"
"Luck."
"Are you saying that it was just luck?"
As soon as he stepped out of the tent, Kraiss's eyes widened more than usual as he asked back. The dealer friend who had rolled the dice was astonished. He didn't go into a frenzy saying it was impossible. He was the one who had rolled the dice. Thanks to that, Enkrid was able to get up and walk out easily. It wasn't something to be guilty about. He had never cheated. Just like a cheap soothsayer imitating, he just knew all the numbers the dice would spit out.
"I'll buy you a beer in the village later."
A soldier who had made a profit thanks to Enkrid patted his shoulder and passed by.
"It really was luck. I have no talent for gambling."
Enkrid turned his walking direction as he spoke, and Kraiss followed closely.
"If that's being untalented, then all the talented folks must be buried underground."
"Sometimes luck follows you."
"...If luck follows you twice, your pockets won't just be full, they'll burst!"
As they walked, Enkrid handed over seventeen silver coins.
Clang.
The sound of silver coins clashing made Kraiss grab his pocket. Having received them, Kraiss moved on, saying, 'Okay, I'm not one to know.' Then suddenly, he stared intently at Enkrid with his large eyes.
"I figured it out."
What?
Enkrid asked with his eyes. Continuing with a broad smile, he said.
"Are you trying to hit on the commander coming tomorrow? With flowers? But then, wouldn't roses or lilies be better than white steed flowers?"
Gambling aside, the requested items seemed to be of a strange kind.
"...Will it work?"
What goes through this guy's head? There were rumors that a new company commander coming tomorrow was a woman. Yes, it had been said that a woman was coming. But would she fall head over heels just because of a bouquet? It wouldn't even work on a country girl. Of course, having a face like Kraiss might work. But still, would it? At best, it'd break even, and at worst, it might lead to an immediate execution for insulting a superior.
"The Squad Leader looks quite good when dressed up."
"Do you always ask so many questions when asked to fetch something?"
From now on, would he have to run till he sweat on his feet to fetch the items by lunchtime? Enkrid spoke with his eyes, and Kraiss understood. Turning his body around, Kraiss moved briskly.
He had to, or it would be trouble. Although it had been done a few times before, depending on the time Kraiss took to fetch things, Enkrid too would have to hustle.
Now was the time to rest. Enkrid leisurely ate his breakfast. A soup containing finely crushed barley and wheat, hard bread, and dried meat made up the morning meal. Meat was served only once every three days. Fortunately, today was the day. If not, in the repetitive days, he wouldn't even have seen meat. Usually, he would have dissolved the bread in saliva, but today he crumbled it into the soup. After mixing, the broth thickened just right. When he put it in his mouth and chewed, it had a chewy texture but was still bland. After tearing and mixing the dried meat, the seasoning was just right.
Enkrid chewed thoroughly. The meal became energy for movement. Regardless of skill differences, a soldier who had eaten well showed a difference in combat power compared to one who had starved for days. Warm broth went down his throat and settled in his stomach. After repeating this a few times, the bowl was empty.
"Tasty? Does exploiting the labor of a comrade taste good?"
Rem approached grumbling.
"Very."
"It's good if you're not picky. I've never seen a guy who's picky about food last long. We have such a guy in our squad, don't we?"
"It seems that friend is still doing well."
"Any moment now."
Rem, who had been spewing venom about his squadmate, soon picked up his bowl and moved on. It was time to diligently wash the bowls after filling his stomach with the soupy mix of bread and dried meat. Enkrid took out a cloth soaked in oil and carefully wiped his sword, then wiped it again with a dry cloth. The newly acquired sword was neither made of renowned steel nor crafted by a famous smith, but it was quite usable. Its balance was good, and its blade was sharp enough. It could slice through thick cloth armor or thin leather armor just fine.
After finishing the sword maintenance and stepping out of the barracks, Kraiss appeared. Turning his head from side to side, Enkrid called out to him.
"Big Eyes."
Kraiss approached with a bundle in his hand.
"Here."
The bundle was, of course, the items Enkrid had requested. As expected, it contained five poorly purified throwing knives. The quality was poor, but they were wrapped with properly oiled leather chunks and a large needle.
"I barely managed to get the deer leather gloves."
Enkrid rubbed the blade of a throwing knife with his finger as Kraiss spoke. Indeed, that was the case. There was only one glove for the left hand, not a pair.
"So here."
Kraiss returned a coin.
"The deer leather gloves were calculated as two coins."
Big Eyes was always sharp about money. It was a known fact. He could have argued and received it, but that would have taken time. It was better to focus on today's tasks. There wasn't much time for anything else. The white steed flowers he had brought were withered.
"You're not confessing with them, are you? Couldn't get the fresh ones."
Swindler. Enkrid nodded. This was within expectations. Who in the middle of a battlefield would manage to gather ten fresh flowers?
"Instead, there are twelve."
A swindler with some conscience, at least.
"And here."
Kraiss extended a small pouch. Opening it, Enkrid found rice inside. Probably, if the deal had gone sour, Kraiss would have feigned difficulty in obtaining the rice and later claimed he managed to find it just in time. Transparent trickery, but Enkrid didn't mind. He had obtained everything he needed.
"Good work."
"But what are you really going to do?"
Kraiss was quite curious about what this well-liked Squad Leader would do.
"Sew and maybe brew some alcohol."
That was why Kraiss could only tilt his head in confusion. Suddenly sewing? And why brew alcohol?
"Well, okay."
Kraiss asked no further and left. Enkrid securely placed the knives at his waist and threw the rest into the tent. Then, he strode forward. His destination was already set. Walking non-stop towards the outskirts of the barracks, a soldier saw Enkrid walking and shouted at him.
"Hey there, what's up? The Squad Leader? If you're going to relieve yourself, don't go there."
"Why?"
"Some guy peed there yesterday and got bitten by a snake. A viper. It's not a very venomous one, but he's been scratching his body all day."
"I'm in a hurry. I'll be quick."
"I've said my piece."
It wasn't something to actively discourage. The soldier just let Enkrid go.
'Unless he's incredibly unlucky, he should be fine.'
The soldier thought this as he turned away from Enkrid. Enkrid walked at a moderate pace, looking around. The outskirts of the barracks, designated for relieving oneself. Several pits emitting a foul smell were among the large trees, thick with dry leaves. Enkrid avoided the stinky area and scattered the rice. Then he squatted in a spot without grass and picked up a fallen branch nearby, whittling the end with a throwing knife. Using the blade like a saw, he repeatedly scraped the branch and forcefully pushed the blade outwards, shaping the end of the branch. After several cuts, the end of the branch split into two, resembling a spear.
To an outsider, it might look like he was just passing time, but his intentions were different. While working on the branch, Enkrid kept an eye on the dry grass. It wasn't long before the rustling of the grass signified movement. Snakes dislike rice. It was natural for the snake to avoid the area where he had scattered the rice. Snake hunting had been an occasional activity for him. A decent viper could be sold for a good price. Once, when he sold a snake to a drunkard in the city, he had asked what it was used for, and the lush had laughed heartily.
"Haven't you ever drunk snake alcohol? If you haven't, don't talk."
A hearty drunkard he was.
Sh-sh-sh.
A creature wriggled through the dry leaves. It had a brown body with a suitably angular head. Enkrid pressed down on the neck area with the end of the branch.
Poke.
He mixed in a stabbing motion he had learned. The snake couldn't escape. He then smacked the back of the snake's head with the knife handle to knock it out.
'One down.'
He repeated the process several times After scattering the remaining rice, he continued until no more snakes appeared. It didn't take long. The job was done before the sun had fully crossed the sky.
Enkrid had caught five snakes.
One by one, he grabbed the mouths of the snakes and pressed them against a thin leather pouch. The frightened snakes dripped venom from their venom glands. He repeated this five times and then stuffed the remaining snakes into a thick leather bag.
"Constipated? I was about to check if you really got bitten by a snake because you weren't coming out."
It was the same soldier who had warned him earlier. He looked serious. He seemed genuinely concerned.
"Thanks to you, it was a quick job."
Enkrid said and walked briskly.
Right behind Enkrid's barracks, the Squad Leader of that section had been doing piecework sewing since childhood. This buddy had decent craftsmanship, having learned sewing over his mother's shoulder, and his skills were not bad.
Thinking he couldn't live by sewing alone, he enlisted. Moreover,
'He terribly loves alcohol.'
That's what Enkrid knew about the sewing Squad Leader. Enkrid threw the chunk of leather in front of the hungover Squad Leader.
"Got a moment?"
His complexion wasn't great, but his sewing was really useful. He had done it a few times before. Even if he threatened to report to the company commander about his drinking, he would do it, but then the sewing would be sloppy.
"Make some hand, knee, and elbow guards with this."
"Why should I?"
The Squad Leader scowled. A natural reaction, given they usually had little interaction. It was too urgent to spend time persuading. Even if he started right away, it would be a close call to get it before the battle.
"Want some hidden booze, right?"
At those words, his complexion changed, and his eyebrows twitched.
He looked like an angry boar. In fact, his appearance did remind one of a wild boar. With such an appearance, having delicate sewing skills.
"This will make for a killer drink."
Saying so, he casually dropped the bag of snakes he had caught. The snakes danced wildly on the leather. A frenzied dance.
"It's snakes."
He said without even looking inside.
"Ever tried snake alcohol?"
At that, the Squad Leader nodded as if it was obvious.
"Did you know that it's fucking good?"
Enkrid hadn't tried it. but thanks to a hearty drunkard, he knew.
"If you haven't tried it, you don't know the taste, right?"
He reiterated, and the Squad Leader vigorously nodded.
"I'll give you the snakes. Just make this for me."
"How did you know I'm good at sewing?"
"I heard the company commander talking the other day."
There was no such incident. The buddy had told him himself when drunk.
Well, it wasn't important.
"Damn, blabbermouth."
Even as he grumbled, he grabbed the needle. It was a fair trade.
"Then, please."
"Shit. Okay, got it."
The fellow soldier's eyes didn't leave the squirming snake pouch. He really liked snake alcohol. Enkrid returned inside the barrack, gathered the remaining items, and moved to the place where he had sparred with Rem. No one spoke to him. It was times like these that being in the Troublemaker Squad was advantageous. It also helped make them ostracized, residing behind a small hill where few people passed.
Enkrid, wearing deer leather gloves, crushed the white steed flowers with a stone until their white petals turned dark green. He repeated this until the mixture was right, then added the snake venom.
Originally, the venom of this snake only caused itching. However, mixed with white steed flowers, it was different.
It was the 77th 'today' when he had been paralyzed by this venom, and the enemy soldier who had giggled in front of paralyzed Enkrid had spilled the beans on how to make it.
What's so good about making this, he had thought. So he had made it a few times, and it was pretty decent. After crushing the flowers and mixing the venom, he smeared the sticky green liquid on a flat stone over the blades of his throwing knives. The knife gleamed in the sunlight, reflecting a dull dark-green light.
'The preparation is done.'
Bang! Bang!
"Squad, assemble!"
Just then, a loud call came from within the barracks. It was a well-known routine to Enkrid, repeated many times.
It was the assembly call for battle orders.
Chapter 9: A Different Man Every Day
Battle orders didn't mean there would be a detailed strategic explanation. All they had to do was prepare. As soon as Enkrid heard the orders, he headed to the barracks in the back.
By now, the sewing master, who had sent a squad member to the squad leader meeting claiming he was sick, must have finished making the items.
"You didn't give me any thread."
Indeed, he had.
The hand, knee, and elbow guards made from sturdy leather greeted Enkrid, looking quite impressive.
"Thread?"
Feigning ignorance, the liquor-loving squad leader snorted.
"What am I supposed to do if you only bring the leather?"
What indeed.
'You'll unravel the blanket thread and twist it properly to make it.'
This was something that had been done several times. Even without giving him any thread, the friend who received a wriggling gift did a good job on his own.
"I forgot."
"You don't look like you forgot at all."
Despite his hangover, he still had some wits about him.
"No, I really forgot."
"Tsk."
He didn't seem to believe it, but what did it matter? Enkrid gathered up the leather guards. The stitching was meticulous. Though Enkrid had made some himself before, his comrade's work was definitely of better quality. He was satisfied.
"I feel like I've been tricked."
"Thanks for your hard work."
He patted his shoulder once and returned to the barracks. As soon as Enkrid came back, he simply said there would be a battle in the afternoon and sat down to work busily.
Srrrng.
Enkrid drew his sword and cut the deer leather gloves he held in both hands, slicing them back and forth smoothly. After cutting the leather roughly in half, he elongated it and swiftly made sheaths for the throwing knives. Finally, he cut the ends of the leather into several long strips, creating ties and fastening them like a belt.
It wasn't his first time doing this. Having done it dozens of times, Enkrid was familiar with it. His hands moved smoothly. Seeing this, Rem poked his head over his shoulder and asked.
"What are you doing? You have small knives, why are you using those?"
"Just testing if the blade is sharp."
"Nice hand skills. Hope your sword skills are just as good."
This guy always had a jab for everyone, but they weren't hurtful. Even when there was no progress, it wasn't a big deal. Enkrid ignored him.
"I went to all that trouble to get them, and you just tear them up to make knife sheaths?"
Kraiss poked his head over the other shoulder.
'Why are these guys so interested in me?'
Were their heads broken and they saw him as their actual mother?
'That's kind of disturbing.'
"I used them all up."
"I don't understand what you're thinking. Did you eat something bad somewhere?"
"Come to think of it, you've been running around all day. What's up?"
"Nothing."
He brushed it off. After wiping the blade once more, Enkrid sat quietly and closed his eyes. Then he recalled the countless battlefields he had experienced. Events flashed by like a panorama. It was the battlefield he had repeated 125 times.
Enkrid reflected on it. All this preparation was to survive, not to improve his swordsmanship.
'The battlefield is not a swordsmanship training ground.'
Even if his swordsmanship wasn't great, his long experience of surviving wouldn't disappear. Was it really the sword that kept Enkrid alive all this time?
No. It was the situation, luck, preparation, and composure. He survived by combining all these factors. So, 'today' as well...
'The same.'
He would do his best to survive. Enkrid decided to move past today.
"Charge!"
The cry of his allies was heard. Enkrid was soon pushed into the heart of the battlefield.
He wasn't flustered. He didn't run in excitement. He lifted his head, observing the battlefield with his eyes and regulating his breathing with his mouth.
Hoo.
A short but calm breath. Enemies came into view. Allies came into view. Charging enemies, retreating allies.
Srrrng.
He drew his sword.
And then a flying blade came into sight. Enkrid struck the spearhead with the shield in his left hand.
Thud!
It was a process he had repeated countless times. There were no mistakes. He struck away the spearhead and took a step forward.
"Hiyah!"
He thrust his right foot under the heel of the startled enemy and bent his knee, bracing for impact. It all happened in one breath. Like a pre-arranged sparring session, the enemy, naturally tripped, fell backward.
Thud!
The opponent, who fell headfirst, blinked in confusion. He probably had no idea what had happened. He had tried to stab and retreat but had tripped and fallen.
It had all happened in an instant. As Enkrid passed the fallen enemy, he kicked his chin with his toe.
Crack!
With a crisp sound, pieces of teeth and blood dripped from his mouth. He was knocked out.
There was no need to kill him. Moving forward, Enkrid raised his left arm.
Bang! Crack-crack-crack!
A club aimed at his shield glanced off, grazing his elbow.
Crrrk!
It was a spiked club.
No injuries. The leather armor wrapped around his elbow had done its job.
"Damn it!"
The enemy gritted his teeth. The muscles in his jaw were visibly tensed under his half-covering helmet. This one would be a hassle to handle properly. Many of Enkrid's today's had involved taking hits from this guy on his left arm.
He gripped the hilt and stepped forward with his left foot. It was Vallen Style swordsmanship. Their eyes met. If he drew his sword, there would be a fight.
Both the enemy and Enkrid knew this. Their eyes met, and an implicit agreement was made. They would fight, crossing sword and club.
The enemy's eyes were fixed on Enkrid's right hand.
Srrrng.
Before the sword could even be fully drawn, Enkrid's left hand moved first. A throwing knife strapped to his waist flew through the air. The enemy, flustered, raised his arm.
Thud—
The blade embedded in the enemy's arm.
Even after wearing a cloth armor, the arm couldn't be thickly padded. Otherwise, it would restrict movement. Thus, the blade must have reached and pierced the skin.
"You coward!"
The enemy shouted. There was no such thing as cowardice or dishonor in a fight. Enkrid silently re-sheathed his sword. Vallen Style swordsmanship involved pretending to draw the sword while throwing a knife or stone.
"You bastard!"
The enraged spiked club enemy had veins popping on his forehead. That would only make the poison work faster. The enemy, starting to charge, suddenly fell forward. The paralyzing venom had worked. Thud, he fell face-first into the ground.
He then gasped and sputtered. Enkrid calmly passed by.
The next enemy, he kicked in the groin, then pushed aside.
The next, he quietly approached and shoved from behind.
A confused enemy's head was then struck by an ally's hammer.
Thud!
Even with a helmet, a blunt weapon could crack a head. Moreover, it wasn't a metal helmet but a leather one. Enkrid hadn't done anything particularly remarkable. He just performed the necessary movements and actions at each moment. Of course, all these actions contributed to minor victories for his surrounding allies.
"Thanks for saving me."
A stranger said. Enkrid nodded roughly and passed by. It wasn't anything significant.
"You saved me."
"Fourth-fourth squad leader? Luck or skill? Either way, let's have a drink later."
"Damn, I almost died."
There were more than a few such people. The growth compared to his first death was incomparable. At the core of it was, naturally, the Heart of the Beast.
'Calmly.'
And again, calmly. The Heart of the Beast did not beat recklessly. With a wild nature, it calmly observed everything. In the midst of the battlefield, Enkrid felt the beat of his heart and walked again. A battlefield he had repeated dozens of times. However, that didn't mean he wasn't tense.
'The more familiar it gets, the more vulnerable you are to variables.'
Just because today was repeated didn't mean everyone did the same things. The enemy's actions changed depending on how Enkrid responded. Thus, he walked slowly, prioritizing taking in the surrounding situation.
'Here.'
Swish.
Someone swung a dagger from below. A novel attack aiming at his leg during a fall.
'This has happened before.'
He had tried to dodge it a few times. Then he found an easier way. It's like blocking arrows. If you can't avoid it, block it.
Thud.
The dagger that struck the leather greave did not cut Enkrid's shin. It was natural.
"Huh?"
The enemy's single word of surprise became his final words. Enkrid struck the back of the prone enemy with the iron rim of his shield.
Crack!
"Ugh!"
The scream was short and quiet.
"Waaah!"
Instead, the roar of the battlefield echoed. Enkrid's efforts did not change the course of the battle. It just made things a bit easier for those around him.
'Can't save them all.'
This was a battlefield, a place where dozens or even hundreds died. Trying to save everyone here was foolish and stupid.
"Come on! You bastards!"
The shout belonged to a spearman from another squad. He could tell without seeing the face. Enkrid had taken down over five enemies while walking. That confident shouter had actually died dozens of times. If Enkrid hadn't intervened, he would have died today as well. Usually, he would have bled to death from a leg wound, rolling on the ground. He straightened up and took a deep breath.
'This is the first.'
A battle he had repeated countless times. Enkrid had set his own standards. The first goal was to join the front lines without getting injured.
'No injuries.'
He had just achieved that goal.
The second goal was...
'Finding familiar faces amidst the chaos.'
Of course, even in the chaos, avoiding injury was crucial. Only then could he properly face the sadistic stabbing enemy. Having rolled on the battlefield over a hundred times, he had one thought.
'I want to fight in top condition.'
Would the skills he had honed and learned by repeating today be effective? Could he win against the sadistic enemy who preferred stabbings? Could his efforts allow him to pass today?
Thump.
His heart raced. Apart from the courage the Heart of the Beast gave him.
'I'll surpass today.'
With a clear goal, a clear purpose.
Enkrid's heart beat faster. He walked the battlefield again. Sometimes he ran.
"Uwaaah!"
"Damn, spare me."
"Yeaaaah!"
"Bastards!"
Amidst the chorus of curses and shouts. Enkrid turned his head sharply in all directions.
'The one crouching and being cautious.'
That was who he was looking for. He spotted him without difficulty. He saw a figure sneaking around among the enemies.
'First task.'
Before facing the stabbing enemy, there was a task to be dealt with.
'The backstabbing clubber.'
He even gave him a nickname. If left alive, this guy always bashed Enkrid's head from behind. Was it fate? Of course, Enkrid didn't believe in fate.
'Everything is predetermined from birth? That's bullshit.'
If the sword broke, he would use the broken blade. If there were no weapons, he would use his fists. If there were no teeth, he would use his gums. He would do anything if talent didn't suffice.
'I'll climb up like this.'
What are knights?
What is the power to change the tide of battle?
An unachievable wish becomes a delusion, but if he could get closer, that would become a dream. Enkrid never gave up on his dream.
"Hoo."
He exhaled.
Tuk.
He pulled out a dagger and drew his arm back forcefully. In the middle of the murky battlefield. He felt the weight of the dagger on his fingertips. He focused on the target, drawing an imaginary line. A throwing technique taught by a bar's knife-throwing champion one day. This, too, was practiced dozens of times by repeating today. He slightly lifted his left foot, then lowered it, rotating his waist and extending his right hand forward. Lastly, he focused on the sensation at his fingertips, adding a wrist snap.
Swoosh!
The dagger flew along the imaginary line Enkrid had drawn.
"Ouch!"
The flying dagger embedded itself in the shoulder of the clubber. The armor was poor, so it wasn't a difficult task.
"Which bastard did that?"
The enemy cursed, looking around. There was no need to make eye contact. Without an antidote, he would have to lie down quietly. Soon the enemy fell, and Enkrid calmly began searching for the second target. This time, it was the enemy who was good at throwing axes. This guy always threw axes to disrupt. Taking him out beforehand would prevent interference in the duel.
"God!"
A devout ally soldier shouted. Swearing and menacing words echoed everywhere. Enkrid walked, precisely seeking what he wanted while observing his surroundings. He blocked minor attacks with his shield. If he saw an opening, he tripped them.
He struck their heads with the flat of his sword. Those who stupidly wore helmets, he slashed from above. This made it much easier for the allies around Enkrid.
'Three throwing knives left.'
The enemy who threw axes was nowhere to be seen.
'His position changes every time.'
But this general area was correct.
'Let's start with Bell.'
He had to save the ally who might get his head pierced by that eagle-eyed guy.
'To the right from here.'
He walked, watching the allies' movements. Walking, he blocked a few attacks, then discarded the broken shield. Despite having repeated this countless times, the shield always broke.
'Around here.'
A battlefield repeated over a hundred times, even if it changed every time, some things were naturally ingrained in his eyes and body.
A rolling shield.
Enkrid stepped on the edge of the shield. The shield, wedged on a stone, shot up into the air with a thud. He caught it in a swift motion. It was closer to a trick, but after countless repetitions, it was easier than bending down to pick it up.
"...You've got skills."
A voice of an ally who happened to see it.
"Enemy behind."
A comrade who had died several times watched him, dumbfounded. He turned his body sharply. He faced an enemy charging with a spear.
"Damn, a sneaky bastard."
The two fought for their lives. The ally won. He had watched this fight about twenty times. So there was no need to see more. The battlefield was not only familiar but ingrained in his body. Enkrid mentally divided the area, drawing a map.
'Let's go to Bell first.'
He moved.
"Argh!"
Bell fell.
Thud.
An arrow-blocking shield.
"Whoa, I'm alive?"
"Don't lift your head. Crawl back. More arrows coming."
Bell followed his advice faithfully. In many of todays, the second arrow had pierced Bell's head dozens of times. Crawling back was the correct move.
"...What? Are you secretly fucking Lady Luck?"
It was Rem. Damn that was savage. He said things that would make a devout believer of the goddess flinch without a care.
"Not a scratch?"
Facing the stabbing guy in perfect condition. That was Enkrid's ultimate goal today.
"Go do your job."
"I will. But you seem different today."
"I'm a different man every day."
There wasn't a single same day among the repeated todays. Each day was a da
y of growth.
"...You should take some medicine, squad leader."
With that, Rem left.
'Was I too unlucky earlier?'
Maybe, but what could he do? The truth was the truth. Just then, Enkrid saw the guy who enjoyed throwing axes. It was an enemy with an axe dangling from his waist. What was the point in waiting?
Enkrid drew a dagger coated with poison.
Chapter 10: He Stabbed
"Gurk."
The man hit by the dagger let out a death rattle. A poisoned dagger was embedded in his side, and a spearhead pierced his throat.
"Gurgle."
Foam bubbled at his mouth as the light faded from his eyes. That was the end. Enkrid looked into the man's eyes before stepping back.
"Waaaah!"
An ally right next to him screamed. The enemy in front of them also screamed.
"Raaaargh!"
Both were large men. When they clashed, it was like two carriages colliding. They grabbed each other and started spinning around. Seeing this, Enkrid stepped back.
What must one do to preserve their life? After over a hundred and twenty times of risking his life, Enkrid had learned many lessons. Preserving his life meant fighting as little as possible. Enkrid took care of himself.
"Die!"
"You fucker."
Instead of shouting battle cries, they cursed as they swung swords, spears, axes, and clubs.
"Don't mess with my brother, you bastard."
A dying soldier left his last words.
"Doesn't matter what you say; I won't take responsibility for your brother."
A soldier pretended to be unfazed by the death of a comrade.
"Die! Die!"
A rookie lost his sanity in the heat of battle.
"That crazy bastard."
"Leave him. He's just pretending to be a berserker."
A veteran cared for his squadmate while watching the rampaging rookie.
"My name is Bar-"
An enemy trying to announce his name died mid-sentence. An ally laughed while pulling out the spear that had killed him.
Stomp.
A foot hit the ground, sending up a cloud of dust. In the sunlight, the dust floated lazily. Beside it, an enemy spat blood. Nearby, a comrade lay with his head smashed. Flesh scattered on the ground, blood soaking the earth. Even if one tried to stay out of the fray, it was impossible to survive in the heart of the battlefield without doing anything.
'Huff, hoo...'
Enkrid inhaled shortly and exhaled long. He controlled his breathing. As soon as he steadied his breath, he saw a spearhead flying through the dust. Enkrid loosely held his shield, blocking the spear.
Thunk.
The spearhead bounced off the shield. By holding the handle loosely, he could absorb the impact. At the same time, a club swung diagonally from the side. Enkrid ducked forward, dodging the club, and lunged at the attacker.
Thud.
He slammed his shoulder into the enemy's chest. As they fell, he drew a dagger and stabbed their thigh.
Crunch!
The blade tore through the thick cloth, making a deep cut in the enemy's thigh.
"You bastard!"
The enemy shouted, shoving Enkrid away. Using the force to steady himself, Enkrid drew his sword and slashed horizontally. The thigh injury hindered the enemy’s movement. The staggered enemy couldn't avoid the blade and was struck on the neck.
Slash!
The blade half-embedded itself. Enkrid pulled it out with force.
Crunch.
The blade tore through muscle, nerves, tendons, and bone as it came out. Blood gushed as the soldier tried to cover his neck with his hand. Of course, such a wound couldn't be stopped with a hand. Enkrid didn't look back. He knew an ally would deal with the spearman who had attacked him.
"You bastard!"
It was Bell. He hadn't saved him for nothing. Once saved, Bell stayed close and watched his back. He was a loyal friend.
Clang! Clang!
The sound of metal clashing echoed. Enkrid lost interest in the fallen enemy and picked up a stone from the ground. Then he turned and threw it immediately. The enemy, who was evenly matched with an ally, paused when hit by the stone.
Smash!
Bell swung his spear and struck the enemy's head. It was an excellent hit.
"I think I've repaid my debt."
Bell panted as he spoke.
"Do you really think so?"
Did he think repaying a life debt was that simple?
"Maybe I've only repaid half."
Bell scratched his helmet with his bloody hand. Not that it would make him feel any better. Bell stepped back slightly. After falling once, he had learned to be more cautious. Following the flow of the battle, Enkrid moved slowly.
"Save me. Gurgle."
A soldier begging for his life foamed at the mouth. He recognized the face. A gambler who had died countless times.
"I can't save you."
Enkrid said calmly. He had tried many times, but saving him was impossible. Thus, he stepped into the battlefield. Among the approaching enemies, he searched for the sadistic attacker. It wasn't hard to find him. The moment he found him, Enkrid drew his last remaining dagger and threw it in rhythm with his steps.
Thud, whoosh, whizz!
A perfectly timed throw that few could dodge traced a thin line through the air.
Thunk!
The enemy twisted and caught the dagger on his shoulder. The slanted dagger struck his scapula and bounced off. A reflexive action, yet an almost perfect defense. Enkrid felt the enemy's gaze on him. Blocking the dagger and immediately identifying its source? He had thought it many times, but this sadistic attacker was no ordinary person.
The enemy charged. With each step, blood-soaked dirt flew backward. It wasn't far. So, it was time to test everything he had learned from repeating today. His condition was better than ever.
Thus, he was ready.
The enemy brought his sword down vertically. Enkrid raised his shield.
Thud!
The blade striking the oiled wood felt heavy.
"The basics of swordsmanship? It's strength."
One of the swordsmanship instructors had said.
"Beat strength with skill? Hah, that's laughable. Try beating a giant with just skill."
"Do you know how many died trying to deflect against giants?"
"The basics of swordsmanship are strength. Strength. So train hard."
Thanks to that teacher, he had built his body well. Holding the shield, Enkrid didn't easily get pushed back. His strength was on par with the enemy's.
"Hmph!"
The sadistic attacker sneered. While Enkrid's vision was obscured by the shield, the enemy kicked his ankle. Enkrid blocked it with his greave. Steel-plated boots were weapons themselves.
Thud.
A sharp pain shot up his shin, but it didn't break.
That was enough. He pushed his shield out and drew his sword, swinging it upward.
Whoosh!
The sadistic attacker had anticipated it, already stepping out of the sword's range. Then he jumped forward, deeper than the distance he had retreated. It was a charge timed with Enkrid's sword swing.
"Hah!"
Enkrid shouted, putting all his strength into swinging his shield like a club. The sadistic attacker tucked his chin.
Thwack!
The enemy was hit in the head and fell to the side. Enkrid, about to swing his sword again, stepped back.
Whoosh.
The enemy, still on the ground, drew a dagger and slashed diagonally. If he had charged, the dagger would have hit above the greave. In a short moment, the enemy saw the position of the guard and found the gap. People would call that talent. Enkrid had to die and die again, learning the Heart of the Beast to achieve that.
The enemy had none of that. He had no experience of rolling on the battlefield countless times.
Enkrid could see it. The enemy was either a rookie or had little battle experience. Otherwise, he wouldn't charge so recklessly.
It had been the same when they first met. He had almost fallen for the enemy's stab. No experience but brilliant talent. But he wasn't envious.
'I can catch him.'
He could do it. Confidence built up. He intuitively knew today's efforts weren't in vain. It was time for the efforts made with death to pay off.
"You bastard."
A venomous look showed in his eyes. The enemy got up, and in that moment, another ally stepped between Enkrid and him. The sadistic attacker crouched without hesitation and struck the ally's shin with his sword hand.
Crack.
The sound of a bone breaking.
Whenever an ally stepped in, this was the pattern. The next move was always to stab the ally's neck with a dagger. A fluid attack pattern. It was a known pattern. The sadistic attacker drew his dagger and stabbed. The shocked ally couldn't do anything, his eyes wide open. Just before the blade pierced his neck...
Whoosh, the ally's body was pulled back.
Slash, crunch.
The blade slashed his cheek, grazed his temple, and scratched his helmet.
"Huh!"
The surprised ally fell back, speechless, gasping for air as he sat on the ground. Enkrid stood before the soldier, clenching and unclenching the hand that had grabbed the ally's neck instead of a sword.
"Back off."
This was his fight. That was his opponent. He had to confirm his achievements.
Thump.
His heart raced. Enkrid felt a mix of emotions. Whether surpassing today was the right thing. Whether he could defeat the enemy. An inexplicable sense of competitiveness. The baseless intuition that overcoming this opponent would lead to the next step.
"I won't hold back."
The sadistic attacker said. Look at that, how ridiculous. A lack of experience, despite talent, was evident if he were truly serious.
'He should've shown a gap instead of talking.'
If he wanted to win, he should have done that. So, Enkrid did it instead.
"Huff, huff."
He deliberately breathed heavily. He flinched at every gesture from the enemy. At one point, the enemy's eyes, which had seemed red, were now a dull brown. Those brown eyes sparkled. The sadistic attacker stepped closer, slashing his sword.
Whoosh!
It was a different speed from before.
Thump.
His heart raced. There was no panic or closing of his eyes. The Heart of the Beast remained calm.
"Watch closely and just dodge."
Rem always said that. He had thought it was just teasing. But it wasn't. He saw it. He tensed his ankle and twisted his body.
Whoosh, the blade grazed his shoulder.
Right after dodging, he slashed horizontally.
Ting.
The enemy raised his dagger. Enkrid's sword and the enemy's dagger formed a cross.
Ting-ting-ting!
Pressing down with force, the blades clashed, sending sparks flying. The enemy twisted his dagger, deflecting the sword sideways. Enkrid stopped his thrust and pulled his shield close.
Clang!
The blade struck the edge of the shield. Sparks flew again. The sadistic attacker had already pulled back and swung his sword. He had experienced this pattern before. He knew it well. Turning his head quickly, the enemy was already out of sight. Enkrid didn't hesitate and drove his sword vertically into the ground. The enemy, who had charged low, stopped.
Thunk.
The blood-soaked ground swallowed the blade. The enemy, bent over, lifted his head. Murderous intent gleamed in his eyes.
"Tricks."
He clenched his teeth. Tricks were skills too, you bastard. Enkrid didn't respond. Instead, he kicked dirt at the enemy.
Thud!
"Ugh!"
The enemy blocked his face with his arm. Blocking with reflexes again. It wasn't the first time he had seen this. It was no big deal.
"You bastard!"
When he had the upper hand, he boasted and spoke of mercy. He reveled in despicable joy in his eyes. When cornered, he quickly got excited. His personality was clear. As he stood up, the enemy charged again.
Clang! Clang! Clang!
Blocking the relentless sword strikes with his shield, it began to creak. Closing the distance, the enemy thrust a dagger at his side. Before, he had been stabbed like this and died, gasping. Enkrid raised his elbow.
Thud!
The blade struck the tough leather guard. At the same time, Enkrid pushed his forehead forward. It was a Vallen Style close combat technique.
A headbutt.
Thwack!
"Ugh!"
He headbutted with all his might, making his head spin. Usually, there would be someone swinging a club from behind at this moment. But not today. There was no one throwing an axe either.
Instead, there was Bell.
"Fuck, I'm helping!"
Bell shouted.
"Just block anyone who interferes."
'This is my fight.'
Suppressing the nausea and regaining his balance, he heard the enemy muttering.
"You crazy bastard."
'If my head is spinning, so is yours.'
The dizziness quickly faded.
"I'll watch you struggle and die."
The sadistic attacker took a stance. One foot forward, the other back. A stance like a charging cavalryman. From that stance came a thrust as fast as an arrow. Tension gripped his heart. He exhaled to release the tension.
'Stay calm.'
Could he overcome the wall of talent with repetition of today? It was time to find out.
The enemy moved. He was just a dot. That's how he appeared. Despite having experienced it many times, it was still the same. The dot became light, then a blade that pierced Enkrid's body. No, he barely dodged it.
Whoosh.
The blade grazed his side. Predicting the target and dodging according to the blade's movement. Enkrid's body followed his thoughts faithfully. The burning pain followed the graze on his side. He ignored it. Instead, he stepped forward with his left foot, drawing his sword hand back. Pulling his right elbow tight. Like an arrow on a string.
He shifted his weight onto his left foot. He had watched and learned. He had learned through being stabbed. Completed through sparring with Rem.
Thud.
When advancing, focus on balance over strength. Imbue the blade with his will.
'Stab.'
Firm will infused the sword. Releasing the tensioned muscles, he thrust his sword.
Thunk!
The sharpened blade stabbed at the enemy's heart. It pierced through the leather and thick cloth armor reaching the heart.
It felt as if the sword, hand, and arm had become one. A moment to savor the satisfaction of achievement as a reward for his efforts.
"Hey!"
Someone shouted. Enkrid didn't even register the shout. Before he could bask in the joy of victory.
Thwack!
An immense impact struck his left side, lifting him off the ground.
'Huh?'
What was this?
It was a situation he had never encountered in the 125 times of repeating today.
"It’s a damn frog!"
Whether it was Bell or someone else shouting, he didn't know. That was Enkrid's last memory.
He fainted.
Chapter 11: The Frog
"Damn it."
Rem spat on the ground, twirling his axe like a toy.
He had just lost track of the guy they called Hawk’s Eye.
It felt as uncomfortable as not wiping after taking a shit.
'How long has it been since I last failed on a hunt?'
The archer was quick-witted and fast-footed. As soon as he sensed Rem's presence, he bolted. Even the arrow he fired while escaping was sharp. Rem rubbed the spot near his left side where the arrow had grazed him. There was no wound. He had just failed to dodge it perfectly.
Annoyance aside, he charged in, slicing through the enemy ranks at an angle. Rem started heading back to where he had been.
"Who the hell is this guy?"
"Kill him!"
There were a few allies around him. He had gone in too deep, but it didn't bother him much. Instead of grumbling or cursing, Rem swung the axes in his hands. He had picked up the axe in his right hand from an enemy, but its balance was terrible. However, that wasn't something to worry about. If he wasn't going to use it, he could just throw it away.
Whoosh, thud!
He slashed the jaw and neck of an enemy blocking his path with the axe in his left hand, causing a fountain of blood to gush out. Rem swiftly avoided the blood spray and swung his right hand forcefully. The axe sliced through the air.
Whoosh—
Even though it wasn't a throwing axe, it flew fiercely and hit its target.
Thunk!
The axe split an enemy's head in half. After causing chaos among the enemy, Rem returned to his allies' ranks.
'I wonder if our squad leader is still alive.'
He wasn't someone who would die easily. Rem had never met such a tenacious person before.
'Even among my tribe, there was no one like him.'
He was probably holding out, being careful and hanging on. It would be a waste for him to die here. Although, he wasn't exactly fit for the battlefield either.
'The Heart of the Beast would suit him well, but his talent is truly unfortunate.'
Feeling sorry, he had taught some of his tribe's secret techniques to Enkrid. It wasn't out of a desire to be a mentor. There are just some people you don't want to see die in front of you. It can't be helped if they die out of your sight. That's how he returned to his usual position.
"You caused a mess and have nothing to show for it."
It was Jaxon. One of the key members of the 4-4-4 Squad. Apart from the squad leader Enkrid, nobody got along well. It was amazing that the squad even functioned at all, which pointed to Enkrid's inexplicable charisma.
"Oh? Are you asking to die? Do you want your head split by an axe?"
"The archer you missed has made a mess of the battlefield."
This was clearly picking a fight. You didn't need to look far to see the impact on the battlefield. It wasn't the archer's fault; it was because of the frog.
The frog had suddenly appeared and disrupted the battlefield. Whether it was due to his luck being good or bad, he hadn't crossed paths with Rem yet.
"Shut up. If you don't want to die, don't talk to me."
"Crazy barbarian."
They both turned away from each other. They had just happened to cross paths. Criticizing each other was part of their routine.
The Fourth-Fourth Squad didn't maintain formations. Everyone fought their own battles. Even without formation or gathering, they stood out.
'Except for big eyes.'
Even Rem had probably drawn some attention by slicing through the enemy ranks. Jaxon's specialty was appearing silently out of nowhere. Far away, he saw a few other squad members. They were all making their own marks. One was lazily swinging his sword. Another was methodically beating people to death. None of them were ordinary. Of course, the standout was the squad leader. Despite lacking talent, he had survived through sheer determination. Who would call that 'ordinary'?
'Just in case.'
Rem decided to find and protect the squad leader. He planned to watch his back without him noticing. He still thought Enkrid was too valuable to die.
'He's the first person on this continent to learn my tribe's secrets.'
With various reasons in mind, he moved. Soon, he spotted Enkrid.
'Hmm?'
While he was distracted, an enemy charged. Instinctively, Rem tripped the charging enemy and struck his jaw with the axe handle. The enemy spat out broken teeth. Rem spun around, elbowing the enemy's helmet.
Crack. Thud!
The sound was similar to thick firewood breaking. It had broken the enemy's neck in one blow. Rem twirled his right arm, but his gaze remained fixed. Despite dealing with the charging enemy, his eyes had been on the squad leader the whole time.
'Skilled?'
It was a sight he hadn't seen before. That skillfulness made him watch instead of stepping in to help. He didn't seem like he would lose. It was a reality close to intuition. Enkrid was fighting a fairly skilled enemy. There was an unprecedented calmness and boldness in his actions.
'How?'
How could a person change so much overnight?
"I'm surprised too."
Beside him, Jaxon appeared again. It seemed their paths kept crossing. Had this guy also come to watch the squad leader's back?
"I've been watching all day. While you were messing around."
"So?"
"I thought he must be living together with the goddess of luck."
"What?"
"He got lucky."
Just luck? It didn't seem like luck alone could explain his current state.
"His skills have also improved remarkably."
Jaxon got along well with other squads but had a bad relationship with Rem. Well, that was true for everyone in this squad. In fact, the conversation they just had was the longest and most ordinary one since Rem joined this squad. That meant Jaxon was equally surprised. Rem was just as shocked.
Moreover, Rem saw two even more surprising things.
The first was Enkrid dodging an enemy's thrust and countering with an almost perfect sword strike.
"Nice!"
Rem muttered involuntarily. Jaxon nodded slightly.
Persistent effort. Knowing how hard the squad leader worked, he couldn't help but cheer for him.
Talent is funny.
Sometimes it lets you leap several steps at once. Both Rem and Jaxon had experienced that, so Enkrid's current state didn't feel alien to them. He seemed to have leaped several steps in an instant.
'He won.'
The opponent wasn't easy. Rem could have beaten him with a few axe swings. The squad leader, however, who would have lost ten out of ten times against this enemy, ended up winning. It didn't look like an easy victory.
He bore minor wounds. The shield in his left hand was a broken piece of junk. His hand and knee guards were torn and tattered. He was panting heavily, his breath labored.
'The Heart of the Beast.'
Rem quickly assessed the squad leader's state. Calmness and composure. The foundation for that was the secrets Rem had taught him.
'But to this extent?'
It was astonishingly refined. Rem felt a sense of pride.
"Frog!"
Just then, someone shouted. It was another soldier behind the squad leader. What was his name? Bell? He remembered because the name sounded similar to his own. Just as Bell had said, the frog darted forward like a shadow.
Frog, the frog-man. His face resembled a frog's. So did his skin. His skin was slick, like it was coated with oil, causing all blades and blunt weapons to slide off. To kill him, you had to pierce his heart or burn them with magic or sorcery. That was no easy task.
Frog had superior strength and combat instincts, being part of a natural warrior race. As a combat-specialized species, they could master any weapon in just days. Frog sprinted, his body parallel to the ground, and kicked Enkrid's side with his foot. It didn't seem like he intended to finish him off with that one kick.
Seeing Enkrid fly sideways, Frog landed and assumed a stance. He reached back, grasping a spear. Leave him alone, and he would die. He would definitely die. As soon as Rem saw the black shadow, he sprang forward.
Bang.
The ground caved in with a boom. His forceful step sent the earth up like a small fountain. In a flash, Rem was beside Frog.
Whoosh!
Without a word, he swung his axe in a long arc. It curved down like a whip, transferring force from his shoulder and arm to the axe blade.
Frog, instead of throwing the spear, performed an incredible trick. Mid-throw, he sidestepped with his right foot and swung the spear shaft upward like a wooden stick. It all happened in an instant.
Clang!
The axe and spear collided. A shockwave radiated from the impact.
"Grr, an intruder? An ugly human?"
"Damn frog, that's our squad leader."
"The squad leader is weaker than the squad members?"
Frog instantly assessed Rem's skills. Dash, axe swing, judgment.
Frog were a natural warrior race. If anything matched their combat skills, it was their insight. Their bulging eyes assessed an opponent's strength in an instant. They were a species born with the talent to discern talent. Frog's eyes rolled, and he stepped back.
"Fine. I've calmed down."
"What the hell?"
"Ugly human, that man has pierced 'it' of a person I know. I got excited for a moment. But I taught him, so... fine, fighting to the death here isn't worth it."
Frog's insight wasn't limited to assessing people's talents. Their combat instincts instantly determined the odds. Rem didn't think the situation was entirely unfavorable, but if he could avoid a fight, that was good.
Being paid peanuts to fight Frog was a losing battle. He fully understood what Frog was saying. As long as their heart wasn't pierced, frogs regenerated their limbs. They were sensitive about the word 'heart.'
They didn't use the word 'heart' at all. Seeing someone die from a pierced heart could make them lose their minds. A berserk frog exuded a truly savage aura. An undertrained frog wouldn't even step onto the battlefield.
Rem reflected on what he knew.
'Damn, I guess I'm getting used to this place.'
Reciting details about frogs so smoothly meant life on this continent had become ingrained in him. Frog tapped his heart armor. A piece of armor designed solely to protect the heart, called "Heart Armor." It was a certification of sorts.
Their city would rather break an unrefined blade than send it out. The Heart Armor was a badge of identity for frogs.
"See you again, ugly human."
Why did he keep calling him ugly? Frogs liked jewels and had unique aesthetics. They preferred attractive humans.
"That face is too good to kill."
Frog flicked his tongue. It shot out and snapped back like a frog catching a fly. That was his smile. He glanced at the squad leader and slowly retreated. Females liked handsome men. Males liked pretty women. That was the Frog way. Their criteria for mating were different from how they judged humans. But they liked attractive humans for some reason. Well, that wasn't Rem's concern.
"Are you alive?"
Rem saw Jaxon holding the squad leader.
"His ribs cracked from a kick. But in that short moment..."
"Yeah, he blocked with his arm."
Impressive. Worth teaching. Blocking at the moment of impact showed he had learned well thanks to the Heart of the Beast. Rem felt a sense of pride.
"The impact seems to have shaken his head. He might not die, but if left like this, he could."
"The battle is cooling down. Carry him. Let's go."
"You carry him. I'll clear the way."
"You'll get an axe to the head someday."
"You better watch out for a knife in your back."
Rem huffed but didn't escalate it. Fine, the squad leader had performed well.
That was enough.
Rem carried Enkrid. Jaxon led the way with his sword and shield. From a glance, he didn't seem exceptionally skilled. But close observation revealed he was clearing the way with less than half his ability.
'Sneaky wildcat bastard.'
Rem cursed Jaxon inwardly as he walked. The squad leader on his back breathed softly, as if asleep.
Chapter 12: Two Days
Frog recalled the scene he had witnessed.
"I thought he would win."
He had even taught the guy. He had quite a bit of talent. Frog didn't like his personality at all, but that wasn't his concern. A soldier trained mainly in stabbing. A guy with considerable talent. He wasn't someone who should die on such a trivial battlefield. If left alone, he could have at least reached the level of a company commander.
Frog thought about why the soldier had died.
"Lack of experience?"
No, this wasn't the first soldier raised in this manner. He wasn't someone who would die so easily.
"Bad opponent?"
So, it was just bad luck. He had been abandoned by the goddess of fortune. Frog chuckled, making a grating sound.
"Luck is also a skill."
As he entered his camp, his lieutenant approached.
"I've been looking for you, general."
"Oh, really?"
"Did you go to the enemy's territory?"
"I just went out for a stroll."
"You seem to be in a good mood."
"I saw a guy die from a stab wound in 'that place.'"
For Frog, the heart was a forbidden word. He loathed seeing it pierced, even from a distance. Yet here was Frog, talking about it and laughing. The lieutenant should have suspected something was wrong with the general's mind, but he didn't.
The experienced frogs occasionally mentioned the word heart. And the Frog before him was a seasoned soldier. He could mention the word heart if he chose to. So, seeing someone die from a pierced heart could make him laugh.
To be precise, Frog could laugh when he saw something more interesting than someone dying from a pierced heart.
"You must have seen something amusing."
"Well, just a strangely interesting guy."
He couldn't be an ally. If he were, Frog would have brought him back already, he said nonchalantly as he walked on. Frog had thick soles. He didn't even need boots. In fact, some frogs occasionally embedded nails in their soles because they were too slippery.
But General Frog disapproved of those who embedded nails in their soles. With excellent senses and proper training, slippery soles could also become a weapon.
"He imitated the stabbing perfectly."
It wasn't a matter of talent. Frog could gauge the level of the technique the opponent had mastered. General Frog had seen the enemy soldier stabbing. He knew because he had seen it.
