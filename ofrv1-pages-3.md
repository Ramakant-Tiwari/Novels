「**An echo of a knight I met before… The dark knight who reaped hundreds of lives. I called him forth from his blood and weaved his plating from the shadows. Your task is to face him**」

“Can I destroy him?”

「**If you are capable**」

The vampire continued to talk, sounding rather prideful of her creation.

「**However, it will not be so simple. It may be an echo of the past, but it shares the same blood of the original knight. His armor that I’ve made from the shadows bears a toughness harder than steel. He is as close to perfect —**」

- *Fwoosh.*

The darkness was suddenly cleaved in two. Along the trail of the blade, the world was split. It was a swing that cut through space itself. The Aerial Blossom was a pair of scissors that severed the world. Even the black mist, supposedly stronger than steel, gave way to the Regressor’s lone strike.

***She said earlier that she could cut light itself. I don’t doubt it anymore. After all, she had no trouble cutting the darkness.***

「**…Not bad**」

The vampire expressed amusement as she witnessed the swordsmanship. However, her real thoughts showed a little more shock than that.

「**Huh…? Even if he wields a special sword… A single strike? That echo should’ve been almost impenetrable to anyone besides paladins…**」

‘You’re surprised, aren’t you?’

The creation of the knight wasn’t the true extent of the vampire’s power, but it should’ve been more than enough for a skinny ‘boy’like the Regressor. She had recreated the once-infamous black knight, and the Regressor had taken it out in a single strike.

「**At that age? Has there been some gigantic development to humanity while I was asleep…?**」

***I hope you don’t take her as the standard. The Regressor has gathered all kinds of secrets and abilities over the numerous lives she’s lived. Even if she hasn’t regained her true power, some of it is still intact. And to add on to that, she has that ridiculous blade.***

***It’s not that humanity made large developments. She stole humanity’s future for herself.***

The vampire quelled her surprise.

「**You don’t even seem to be twenty years old yet. Your talent is quite impressive. For someone of your caliber, you would be more than capable of forging your own path**」

“Well? I’m not too talented. I just got lucky and found some secrets that quickly let me get stronger. There are plenty of people in the world with more talent than I have. I’m nothing more than a copycat who follows their tracks, imitating their journeys.”

The Regressor meant what she said. To her, who walked amongst monsters every life, any weakness was a reminder of her inferiority.

It may have sounded like she was being overly modest, or even boasting, but she was truly nothing compared to the enemies she had to face.

「**You really are too modest**」

“It’s not modesty. Look.”

The Regressor pointed the blade at me. I almost jumped in surprise.

*Fuck. Why does she need to point at people with a weapon? Does she have no manners? Considering the fact that people think even pointing a finger at a person can be rude, a sword is completely out of the question.*

The Regressor smirked at my response.

“Even he deflected my strike.”

「**That blade of yours?**」

“Yeah. This Chun-aeng. With a single finger too.” 「**That brat?**」

‘Well, it’s true… but I don’t think I could do it again even if I tried.’

「**If he deflected this boy’s strike with a single finger, he must be at least several stages stronger. Is that normal for youngsters these days? Can children cut steel now?**」

‘The Regressor… And now me, who has been placed above the Regressor. The vampire made the mistake of overestimating the average of the entire world after looking at the wrong samples.’

***Don’t calculate the average based off the Regressor! How will everyone else feel? You need to apologize to the majority of the world that you just deemed less than average!***

***And especially me! My score is too inflated!***

「**When he said bloodcraft was outdated, was he not just being rude…? Has time really pushed the world that far ahead?**」

After having unintentionally induced another misconception… “…So, I’ll try my best to learn.”

「**If that is so…**」

「**I, too, shall try my hardest so this boy can defeat that insolent brat over there**」

…The vampire decided to give it her all.

Tyrkanzyaka extended her finger towards Shei. The tip of her finger developed a slight crack. From the newly formed opening, red blood began to flow. It was a little different from the blood that the vampire typically controlled.

The blood was normally controlled by the vampire through her authority as the Progenitor glistened and wavered with a deep red magical energy, as if it was ready to infect the world.

However, the blood that the vampire was releasing now was just like any normal blood… it was to the point where it felt strange.

The blood shone a normal shade of red, not emitting energy, with a slight scent of iron. It seemed to propose the hypothesis that the same blood flowed in vampires as the rest of humanity. However, its aura was large enough to fill up all of Tantalus. Even the darkness itself seemed to be retreating in awe.

The string of blood slowly flew towards the Regressor and circled around her.

「**With great strength comes great sacrifice. However, you have more than enough potential to compensate for that**」

“This is…”

「**My original blood**」

The original blood of the Progenitor.

If one were to present this to the church, they would instantly receive the position of a paladin and be showered with the highest of blessings.

If one were to offer it to another vampire, they would promise great fortune and power.

And if one was willing to take a bigger risk, they could put the blood within themselves. If they were to successfully eliminate the hyenas that lusted for the blood of the Progenitor, an extra seat would be added to the Table of Twelve Elders.

In any case, it was something that could completely change a person’s life.

“What’s this for? Do you want me to become a vampire? I don’t really know if I want to do that.”

Facing such a treasure, the Regressor—past being uninterested—had an

expression of dislike on her face. The vampire was shocked once more.

「**But it’s… my original blood…? The blood that shook the world with merely its existence? He doesn’t want it at all?**」

With a quivering voice, the vampire continued, trying her best to hide her emotions.

「**…No. I do not wish to make you a vampire either. I cannot make the same mistake again**」

“Then…?”

「**I shall engrave the original blood onto your heart. The blood of a predator. With it, your instincts in controlling blood would become honed to their maximum potential**」

“Oh, like that? Then sure!”

The Regressor spread her arms wide open. It was clear that she wasn’t interested in the blood itself, but was willing to use it as a supplement to aid her in getting stronger.

The vampire was upset by how little the Regressor had wanted her blood.

「**It was originally supposed to be just a test. If he had wanted to become a vampire, he would not have been worthy of receiving my teachings… But I did not expect such a cold-hearted response. Are vampires no longer idolized by humans?**」

The vampire stretched out her hand. The original blood headed to the Regressor’s chest and formed a red gear-shaped symbol above her heart.

「**…If you do end up mastering bloodcraft, you should be able to remove my blood yourself. You can return it to me then**」

“Alright. You sound a little tired though. Did giving me that blood tire you out that much?”

「**…I am alright. Do not worry…**」

「**But it was my original blood… Have vampires been pushed out of the center of the stage already? I guess I *have* been asleep for three hundred years…**」

It was a cold-hearted world. The vampire sighed, dejected at the idea. 「**Now I shall bestow upon you my teachings**」

While the vampire was explaining things to the Regressor, I stayed somewhat close to them. The reason was simple. The original blood. The blood heralded in legends for the last thousand years. The blood that could afford me a fortune… The blood that would allow me to live like royalty for the rest of my life. That blood that had engraved itself onto the Regressor. It was a tattoo more valuable than gold.

However, I had already refused to become the vampire’s disciple. I couldn’t even dream of asking her for her original blood. She wouldn’t have given it to me in the first place. That much was clear after reading her thoughts. She only used it so that the Regressor would be able to master bloodcraft because I had aggravated her.

‘Tsk. The vampire was overthinking things. If she wanted me under her wing, all she needed was to give me some original blood as well. If she had ordered me to kneel, I would’ve bowed down and licked her feet like a dog.’

However, I still had a chance. The vampire was still confused from the passage of time during her long slumber. As evident by her thoughts, she was still adjusting to the current world.

***And if that were the case?***

***Maybe, if I talk things through well, I might get something.***

「**Hm…? What are you trying to do? Did you not say that you were uninterested?**」

I withstood her hostile gaze. For some reason, she seemed to have taken a dislike towards me.

“I am an official of the Military State, and Tantalus is a place of disciplinary correction. I have a responsibility to oversee the actions of the trainees.”

「**Observe for my sake? Someone like you will oversee me?**」

“Responsibility doesn’t always fall in line with one’s ability, as you know. As much as I trust in you, I still have a duty to watch and observe what you are doing.”

「**Responsibility and ability… I guess that could be a form of chivalry in these times. If he says so, I guess it is understandable**」

The vampire seemed to accept my explanation filled with false confidence. ***Phew.***

***Who knew claiming to be from the Military State would help out so much?*** Despite that, the vampire still had some qualms.

「**However, I am in the middle of teaching a disciple. The secrets of such crafts need to be shared privately, do they not?**」

“Just how long ago are you talking about? These days, a single teacher teaches as many as fifty students. A different teacher is chosen for each subject ranging from combat and magic to strategy. Students themselves pick the classes they want to take and learn together in public environments.”

「**Lies. What idiot would share their precious secrets so easily?**」

“The State. The country collects and controls all knowledge. They sort it out and distribute it to the people for no cost.”

All knowledge was power—be it swordsmanship, magic, or strategy. At least, that was how it had been in the vampire’s times. There was a reason why the system of masters and disciples existed. The master was clearly above the disciple, and the disciple would work like a slave for the master, hoping that they could gain some of the former’s knowledge one day.

Yet, to think of a time when such secrets would be open to everyone, the

vampire couldn’t even close her mouth at the revelation. 「**Unbelievable**」

“Students also have many teachers. They go to private academies and take classes from top of the line, State-managed schools. The teachers don’t think badly of them for doing so either. It’s now the age of enlightenment. Knowledge is no longer transferred secretly. It awaits objective judgement, open to the rest of the world.”

The vampire asked the Regressor if I was telling the truth. 「**Shei, is that true?**」

“Yep. It’s the sole good thing the Military State has done.” 「**I see…**」

After staring at the vampire, who was still in shock because of the change brought about by time, the Regressor turned back to me with a pout.

“It’s not like you need to listen to that bastard. He’s just worried we might be plotting something.”

「**No, if the world has chosen its path, then I too must conform. Resistance to that flow is meaningless. I should not stop him from watching us**」

The Regressor’s face soured. After throwing her a light, teasing grin, I settled down nearby, ready to see if I could gain anything from their training.

The vampire continued her lesson after giving me permission to stay and watch.

「**…So, blood is life. It gives you energy as it flows through your body and allows you to draw out your power. You need to become aware of every single drop of blood in your body. You need to be able to sense where every vein flows**」

The session continued with the vampire’s droning voice. I’d have fallen asleep already, but the sight of the Regressor completely focused on the vampire’s words made me think otherwise.

‘Does this even help? She sounds like she’s just talking out of her ass. Should I try concentrating too?’

I focused on Tyrkanzyaka’s words and the thoughts that formed the words.

「**You have so many powers hidden in your body. Understanding your body is the first step to wielding that power. Feel the pulsing hot streams that branch out throughout your body**」

‘I am a mind reader. Nobody is capable of understanding the words of people better than me. Even the worst teachers can be the best references to me because I understand the intention behind the words. All I require is for the teacher to be knowledgeable in their own field.’

I closed my eyes and concentrated. I could feel the beating sensation of my heart and the pulsing of my arteries.

‘I can feel it! Is this the power of blood?’

「**Blood is like a river. Rivers may seem like they flow elegantly, but water seeps into even the tiniest holes within the earth. The water the earth absorbs would moisturize the soil and eventually make its way back to the ocean. What you need to feel is not the river that everyone can easily feel. The blood that seeps into every part of your body. You need to understand that power**」

‘Or, maybe not. Well, even if I am a great learner, things such as talent and compatibility certainly exists. It’s not like someone can do everything they read in a book. It’s not like I’m an idiot or anything either. Bloodcraft just isn’t for me. Good thing I didn’t learn it. The most I would’ve been able to do is stop a cut from bleeding anyway.’

「**The biggest obstacle to bloodcraft is the heart. The heart is what binds your soul to the world, and yet, under normal circumstances, it moves blood regardless of your intentions. That is why… only the dead can truly master bloodcraft**」

The Regressor seemed to realize something.

“So that’s why vampires are considered undead.”

「**Indeed. Vampires learn to move their bodies solely through bloodcraft. In order to become a vampire, you need to die. You made the right choice in refusing my offer. Your beating heart is proof of your existence as well as the essential ingredient in going even beyond. The heart after all, is a privilege of the living…**」

As if she was reminiscing about something, the vampire paused briefly between her words.

「**I lost myself for a second. Moving on, in order to learn bloodcraft, you need to control your heart. You need to make it stop momentarily or cause it to beat even faster. Do you understand?**」

“Vaguely. You’re asking me to control the pace of my heart when I can control my blood a little, right?”

「**You’re a fast learner. Remember, the heart is the root of your existence. It moves your blood, purifies it, and draws magic energy from its very essence. It is the core of your body, so always…**」

‘Moves blood, purifies, and draws out magic…? Wait. That’s not right.’ “Hold on, Trainee Tyrkanzyaka.”

I stood up. The vampire seemed annoyed at my disruption.

「**…What is it?**」

“Sorry, but the heart isn’t the magic core.”

It was probably because she was from older times.

“Most vampires turned their hearts into their magical cores, so you may think that’s the norm. However, using the heart is actually extremely inefficient and dangerous. Additionally, in order to properly use the heart as a magical core, you need to calm down your breathing as well. These days, people make their magical cores elsewhere.”

「**…**」

“That was how it used to be, but ever since the magical revolution four centuries ago, people stopped doing that. We have found ways to draw out magic without linking it directly to an organ in our bodies. This is the most basic lesson you learn in middle school these days, so it’d be useful to have some knowledge about it… Oh, sorry. Did I interrupt too much? You can continue.”

‘*Phew.* Another good deed done. With that, she’ll probably be much fonder of me—’

「**Is he actually crazy?**」

Contrary to my beliefs, the Regressor was glaring daggers at me. ‘Huh? What happened? I just corrected a mistake.’

「**You think I don’t know that? Why would you interrupt someone in the middle of their explanation without waiting to listen to the whole thing?**」

It was infuriating to see the Regressor acting as if she was the sensible one. It was a given that you should always correct mistakes. The vampire was ancient after all. It was best if we could communicate to our elders properly.

「**…Anyway**」

Trying her best to ignore me, the vampire continued speaking.

「**Even if the heart stops, the blood inside must continue to flow. Blood that stays still pools and rots. Blood that makes its way through the body eventually loses its magic… I mean, this is in the case that the heart is the magical core. Moreover, impure blood purifies itself at the heart, so it is imperative that blood constantly flows to prevent the tainting of your internal body**」

“Hold on. Actually, it’s not at the heart. It’s in the lungs.”

There were a lot of holes in her knowledge probably because of how old- fashioned she was.

This would undoubtedly cause problems if you tried to interpret it directly.

“Actually, what people considered impure blood was just blood that lacked oxygen. Oxygen is inhaled into our body and burns the energy we have to keep our body moving. This process isn’t a matter of purity, but rather consider it more like a fire burning. Just as a burning log stops burning when you cover it with a blanket, the fire of the body stops burning if you close the passageway to the lungs. That’s called dying.”

「**W-Wait, that’s how it works? I never knew that…**」

‘I get why the vampire wouldn’t know, but how do you not know this? You learn this in middle school. …Oh, wait. You’re an orphan. You didn’t go to middle school. My bad. Then… is it possible that I am the most educated person in Tantalus right now?’

The thought made me feel a little better about myself.

“Anyways, now that you know. You may continue your—AAAAAHHHHH!”

A surge of goosebumps raced across my skin, warning me of impending danger. Without hesitation, I immediately leaped to the side. Moments later, the sanguine steed’s hoof obliterated the ground I was standing on.

The concrete floor shattered as though it was glass. Chunks of stone hammered my back.

The horse trampled the floor once again, as if it were disappointed that it missed. The concrete ground gave way like sand each time the hooves reached it. I screamed out.

“Hey! I almost died!”

「**Stop making such a fuss!**」

“I’m not making a fuss! Any normal person would’ve been annihilated from that attack!”

「**Good thing you are not any normal person, then**」

‘If I couldn’t read minds, you’d have been a murderer! Murder is a death sentence here, you know?!’

「**Yes! I am old! I have never been able to fit in with the rest of the world! So what?!**」

“Huh? When have I ever said you’re old?”

「**Like that! Your attitude! You think of me as some ancient crone!**」 “I never said that!”

「**So you’ve thought so?**」

***Oopsie. She caught on.***

***She appeared to have caught on to the fact that I had become aware of her realization.***

Blood boiled. I felt an ineffable emotion surge up from the vampire’s heart. ‘W-Wait. Is this emotion that I sense now… perhaps…?’

I asked carefully.

“A-Are you perhaps slightly angr—AAAAAHHHHH!”

- *Psk.*

A crimson orb hurtled towards me with great speed. I rolled along the floor in an attempt to dodge it. After narrowly missing by a hair’s breadth, the orb decimated the concrete floor behind me.

「**You think you would be any different? You were just lucky that you were born in such nice times! Should I make you a vampire? Do you want me to trap you in my immortal display case that nobody will visit for the rest of your life?**」

The attacks continued. Multiple crimson orbs were hurled at me. They didn’t have any desire to kill. The emotion attached to them was as though the progenitor was a child throwing around her toys.

The problem was that the things Tyrkanzyaka was tossing around, were not toys. Toys would just sting if you get hit by them, but these crimson orbs would mean

certain death at a single touch.

‘I’ll actually die at this rate. I need to draw her attention somehow, but how?’ 「**If you are so smart, why don’t you teach her yourself?!**」

“Alright!”

At my exclamation, the barrage of attacks momentarily ceased. Relieved at the sudden respite, I raised my body back up.

“Trainee Tyrkanzyaka. I have seen your social potential that exists deep within.” 「**Are those your final words?**」

‘I’ll really die if I chicken out of here.’

I ignored the vampire and continued to explain.

“What really matters in rehabilitation is the desire to live and integrate with other people in a society. I see that desire is prevalent within you. That is definitely an ideal that matches the flow of current times.”

‘First thing’s first…’

I spat out random words I had glimpsed from the vampire’s mind. ***Hopefully one of them would calm her down.***

「**Mesh with the times?**」

Thankfully, she calmed herself down and began listening more carefully to my words.

“So, I’ve come to a conclusion today. That you all have the potential of reintegrating back to society.”

「**…And who are you to judge that?**」

“You are all currently being held in the re-education facility, Tantalus. You are all trainees, and I am your trainer. I lead all of you in this small society.”

The vampire probably didn’t even know about the re-education part of this facility. I pointed towards myself with my thumb.

“I shall teach you all! Teach all of you how to fulfill that desire to live normally so that you may all become respected members of society again!”

‘So please don’t kill me.’

Hiding my true thoughts, I finished my speech. 「**…Ha**」

The vampire lowered her hand. The dozens of crimson orbs that had been floating in midair, all dropped to the ground. The orbs that had destroyed the concrete floor so easily, melted back into blood and seeped into the ground.

‘*Phew.* I’m alive!’

As I was about to bask in my relief, the vampire muttered under her breath.

「**I wondered what you might say, but it was just words you would not be able to take responsibility for**」

‘How’d she know?’

A depressed voice crawled out from within the coffin.

It was the voice that had given up hope many times. The type of hope that this time would be different.

「**I am a vampire. A predator who lives off of human blood. Humans either avoid me in fear or wish to be me. Regardless of my desire, our very existence can never mesh properly. A wolf cannot live in a herd of sheep, can it?**」

‘The way she keeps making metaphors really reminds me of old people. Wolves and sheep, huh? So what if she’s a wolf? There’s barely any wolves around these days.’

***But she’d freak out again if I mentioned that, so I decided to respond with***

***another metaphor of my own.***

“Of course, they can.”

「**That is something easier said than done**」

“Should I show you proof?”

「**Try it if you will**」

The vampire thought in a rather pessimistic manner.

Reading that thought, I pulled out the bell from my pocket and rang it.

Now, with a familiar roar, something burst through the second floor kitchen window and ran outside.

- *Crash!*

After having torn through the steel bars of the windows like candy, Azzy landed on the floor and dashed towards me.

“This here is a wolf that can live with a herd of sheep.”

Azzy skidded to a stop next to me. With a mouthful of saliva, she looked at me with anticipation in her eyes.

I extended my arm and petted her head. With a satisfactory bark, Azzy closed her eyes as she enjoyed my touch.

“Dogs used to be wolves. Even the dogs that are raised to ward off wolves from livestock used to be wolves a long time ago. But sheep are not scared of dogs. Dogs do not eat sheep either. Well, they might gnaw on a sheep bone the farmer tosses them from time to time, but that’s about it.”

Both predators and prey could change. Beasts have become tamed by humans. Dogs, for example, is a case where an entire species was tamed.

The vampire was now lost in her thoughts. It didn’t seem like she’d respond for some time.

‘Now’s the time.’

“Woof? Food, where?”

“I’ll give it to you in a bit. Let’s head to the kitchen.” “Woof-woof!”

“Didn’t you eat earlier? And you want to eat again already? Are you sure you’re not the Pig King?”

“Bark! No! Not pig!”

***Dogs and pigs, what’s the difference anyway? But because of how strongly Azzy responded, I needed to let her have her way here*.**

“A-Alright, alright. Don’t bite me!”

Naturally leaving the scene, I headed back to the building with Azzy, leaving the vampire alone with the Regressor.

「**That bastard…**」

After I was decently far away, I heard the Regressor’s thoughts at maximum range.

「**He left me alone to deal with her after causing this entire mess?!**」 ‘Oops, she caught on. Let’s run.’

“Azzy! Run!”

“Woof!”

I sprinted towards the building with Azzy trailing behind.

Meanwhile, the black coffin floated in place unflinchingly.

- **Humans Use Tools  **
- *Riiiiiiiing!*

The alarm felt more like a persistent ache rather than just a mere loud noise.

***Would a cricket made of steel make a noise like this? It felt like a razor-thin blade was chopping away at my ears.***

Unable to resist, I lurched out of the bed and silenced the clock. Waking up with a throbbing headache every day was hardly a pleasant routine, and I gritted my teeth, trying to dampen the ringing in my ears.

“Ugh. That fucking alarm clock.”

The State allowed setting the alarm earlier, but never later than 8 o’clock. No matter how late you tried to set it after that, the piercing screech that always followed suit was almost like an attack.

It was said that the fastest way to find a corpse was to look for a house with an alarm that didn’t turn off. Only the dead could bear that noise.

The only way to guarantee a peaceful slumber was to smash the alarm clock to bits, but the consequences of oversleeping were just as dire. In the Military State where everyday life needed to tick perfectly like a cog in a machine, being late was almost a crime.

“You bastards. At least wake us up more peacefully.”

After stretching my body, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror above the sink. The broken mirror reflected my face, distorted from the cracks.

I was wearing a standard shirt. It was the same clothes I had been given before being strapped in a straitjacket. The shirt was already heavily creased from having worn it for several days.

“I need to wash my clothes soon. I can’t keep wearing the same clothes every day.”

There must be some clean clothes left somewhere. After washing my face, I headed out, looking for anything else I could wear—

“Woof.”

And then immediately closed the door again.

I held the handle tight and pressed my back against the door.

‘Why is that furball waiting outside my door? Does it plan to drag me along on a morning walk?’

“Woof, woof.”

‘Nope. Absolutely not. I have so many things on my plate already. I need to cook for Azzy since nobody else will. Now I need to walk her on top of that? At this rate, I wouldn’t have any personal time to do what I need to do.’

***What’s wrong with just a little walk? That’s the Dog King. They take walks like a king as well.***

“Woof, woof, woof.”

I could hear her front paws scratching on the door. The residence for workers had no locks, so the door rattled alongside my body every time her paws touched the door.

Although Azzy wasn’t trying to break the door yet, it felt as though a battering ram was smashing its horns against the door. I would tire out before the door could break at this rate.

In times of siege, the defenders often charged out of the castle, even if their forces were much weaker than their attackers. They didn’t do this because they were stupid. Instead, they would rather try to do something before they starved to death.

I had the same mindset as I clutched the door handle. “It’s time, you damned beast.”

I was scared.

Who wouldn’t be scared to fight a monster that could tear flesh from bone with a single bite?

However, dogs were loyal to humans. The Dog King had infinite loyalty towards humans and would likely not attack me. There was a possibility that she might bite me in her rebellious struggle, but she wouldn’t tear me to shreds.

***I treated her well until now to gain her trust, but no more. Humanity will no longer kneel.***

***We shall not meet the demands of mere animals.***

***I will fight. Even if it means death.***

With a newfound determination rooted firmly in my heart, I opened the door to see Azzy staring up at me from the floor.

“What have you come here for, foul beast?!” “Woof?”

‘If she even dares to ask me for a morning walk, I’ll collar her up. If she wants food like a pig, I’ll add in extra spices she can’t handle. It doesn’t matter that I can’t fight her head-on. It’s about the mindset. The thought that makes you want to fight! It’s time, mutt!’

“Woof.”

Azzy crawled to my feet. She then fell to the floor again, yawning. ‘Huh? She doesn’t want… a walk? Not even whining for food either?’ I waited for a minute, but all Azzy did was wag her tail against my legs. “She’s just here. *Phew.*”

The Dog King was still a dog at the end of the day. They required interaction with humans. However, the other humans here weren’t exactly suitable for giving Azzy what she needed. The Regressor was too busy, and the vampire wasn’t even alive. The only person Azzy could really interact with was me.

I relaxed and lowered my hand in front of Azzy. Yawning, Azzy rubbed her face into my palm.

“Now this is more like a pet. You’ve finally realized your place.”

The rulers of this world was humanity. That was precisely why the Beast Kings adopted human form and spoke the human language. As the representatives of their respective races, they needed to be able to communicate with the rulers of the lands.

Azzy was just like any other dog in how active and energetic she was, but at least you could always communicate with her. My lips twisted into a sly grin as I patted her.

“Hehehe. Yes, good girl. I don’t even need to use my hands to communicate with you!”

‘Nothing is better than an obedient dog. Well, I think I can make this work. It’s acceptable.’

“Follow me, Azzy! Your nose will be useful in searching the offices.”

“Arf!”

I headed to the management offices, and Azzy got right back up to follow me.

If this were a normal prison, a towering watchtower would be built next to the facility. That tower would rise about two stories higher than the rooftop of the prison, watching over the inmates like they were ants in a colony.. If even a single prisoner was unable to be located, they would whip out their glaring searchlights and figure out a way to locate them anyhow.

Regardless, Tantalus was full of prisoners that the State couldn’t handle.

In order to continue properly maintaining the facility, the State needed to make the corresponding investment. Tantalus needed an army or someone with the combat skills of a general to keep the prisoners in check.

Of course, that was impossible. Spending that many resources on a prison warden was something nonsensically wasteful as far as the State was concerned.

Realizing that abandonment was cheaper than trying to find out some way to control it, they dropped the prison into the abyss and cut off all support. They had essentially left the prisoners to their own devices down here.

Instead of a watchtower, Tantalus had a square building that resembled a storage unit. It was a container building that was separated by a small concrete fence.

The building was in a state of disrepair, and as I climbed over the fence, I winced.

“*Phew.* The insides are completely a mess, huh?”

One wall had completely collapsed. Evidenced by the gigantic palm-shaped indentation in the rubble, it seemed that someone had toppled the wall down by slamming it with their palm. On the steel plates reinforcing the outer walls were many small holes, as if someone had done target practice on it. The holes had traces of having melted.

***Just what were they shooting? Even fire arrows can’t do something like this.***

The roof had collapsed halfway down. The reason was obvious. A gigantic metal beam, similar to the ones you’d find at construction sites, had been smashed through the roof. One of the corners of the building had also completely disappeared, leaving teeth marks in its trace, as if something had bitten it.

***But there’s no creature that has a mouth that big… right?*** ‘Just what happened?’

As I crouched down, advancing carefully, the ground suddenly shook. Looking down, I saw that someone had cleanly cut the concrete floor as though it was cake. This was likely the work of the Regressor.

Something clearly must’ve happened, but all I could do was read minds. I couldn’t tell what happened here in the past. All I could guess was that some massive wave of violence and chaos swept through this place.

I scratched my chin as I turned back to Azzy. “Azzy, do you remember what happened?” “Woof! Everyone fought!”

“Uh, so who? Why did they fight? Can you tell me exactly what happened from start to finish?”

“Arf?”

“Never mind. I shouldn’t have asked you.”

Azzy probably hadn’t picked a side. Her loyalty to all humans meant that she was equally ignorant of all humans. Even if I gained her trust, she probably wouldn’t help me out if I fought against someone else.

The thought pissed me off.

***What was I doing all of this for?***

“Ugh. All my efforts are worthless. No matter how many times I feed you and take you out for walks… A dog is just a dog.”

“I like walks!”

“I know. But *I* don’t.” “Arf?!”

Azzy widened her eyes in shock. Had the fact that someone doesn’t like walks been that much of a surprise for her?

As if she had become worried about her future walks, she hopped up and down, speaking with remarkable fluency.

“Woof! Walks are great! You see so many cool things! It’s so fun!”

“Yeah, yeah.”

“Walks are really, really good. It’s wide open everywhere! You can run all you

want!”

‘So what if it is? Is she trying to convince me? Even if I have become a prisoner, do you think I’d be so easily convinced by a mere dog?’

As Azzy used some ‘high-level’vocabulary skills to convince me about the positive aspects of walks, she looked at me expectantly, with shining eyes.

“You don’t like walks?” “I don’t mind them.” “Woof!”

Unfortunately for her, it was too early to rejoice. Watching her spin around in joy, I added to my previous statement.

“But I prefer laying down and taking a nap.” “W-Woof?!”

“We’ve wasted too much time. Let’s get going.” ‘Haaa… I’ll have to figure things out on my own.’

After indulging Azzy for a while, I walked past the broken door and into the control room.

***Just what did they do to rip through this door as though it was paper? It was still a metal door.***

***Should I head back?***

The building was completely dark due to the lack of lighting. If the roof had been intact and the walls still standing, it would’ve been too dark to see. Fortunately, the newly added gaping holes in the walls allowed enough light to seep in to illuminate the outlines of objects.

As expected of a control room, I saw many things that used to be parts of different machines. The reason I said ‘used to be’was because they were broken to the point where I could barely recognize them.

Scattered bolts and nuts. Split gears. Half of a control panel. A golem missing most of its limbs.

The machines and magic golems that had resided here were completely eliminated during the raid on the building.

“They must’ve broken everything during the jailbreak. I understand that sentiment.”

I agreed with their mindset of revenge. Muttering meaningless words, I rummaged through the mountain of scraps in front of me. I hoped to find something useful that the State hadn’t retrieved from the heap already.

The room was shrouded in darkness, and the piles of rubble were overwhelming. I wasn’t sure where to start, and I ended up sweating as I dug through the piles. The weight of the rubble made it even more challenging, and I struggled to lift it, letting out groans of exertion.

Even if there was a treasure hidden in the trash, I wasn’t really capable of finding it.

“*Tsk.* Nothing.”

As I was about to head back, Azzy perked up and dove into the pile.

As she dug with her bare hands, gigantic scraps of debris flew everywhere, causing me to retreat to a safe distance behind the sunken roof. After tossing aside a concrete block impaled by a steel beam and a large antenna, Azzy pointed to a small cabinet.

Realizing what it was, I forced my body back up. “This is the valuables cabinet, right? Nice job, Azzy.” “I did good?”

“Yeah, good girl. You’re the best doggy.”

“Woof!”

After appeasing Azzy with the compliment, I pulled the cabinet’s handle as she hopped around it in circles. However, the cabinet had a deep indentation in its side, and it refused to budge. It seemed like something inside had broken or bent the wrong way. It was definitely not because I wasn’t strong enough.

***But who am I? A human with wisdom. And human wisdom shines in their tools.***

“First, second, and third-class. What type of lever do we need here?”

“Woof! Walks!”

“First-class, idiot.”

“Woof?! I’m not an idiot!”

I shoved the metal beam into the bent opening of the door and pushed hard.

***…It didn’t work.***

***Hm. But who am I? A human with wits. And when my strength isn’t enough…*** “Azzy, can you help me out?”

“Woof? I’m not an idiot!”

“Yeah, yeah, alright. Just doggy punch this.”

“Doggy?”

“Yeah, just slam this part with your paw. Hard.”

“Woof? Like this?”

As soon as I saw Azzy raise her arm, I turned and ran. Her arm swept through the air.

- *BOOOOM!*

With a gigantic noise, the cabinet flew three meters into the air. The tight door flew off, spinning in the air until it lodged itself into the ceiling. The metal beam

that had been used as a lever was now in the shape of a ‘V’.

The cabinet landed headfirst on the ground.

***That doggy punch was strong.***

“Aw, good girl. You’re the best dog in the world.”

“Best?”

“Yep, the best.”

“Woof! Me, best!”

Leaving Azzy behind, I looked inside the cabinet.

There were a few crystal orbs, likely made as spares, and some paperwork. ‘Is that all?’

Continuing to search, I saw a lead-colored round object in the corner of the cabinet. I had missed it initially because of the darkness.

I shoved my hand in and took it out.

Then I let out a gasp.

“Holy—This is still here?”

***Now this… this was something I could use.***

- **A Fragment of the Apocalypse  **

Hunting and gathering were some of mankind’s oldest instincts. The sensation of reward that was gained from finding something was a primal instinct that had been passed down through generations of human history.

I felt the same way. Having found something useful from my expedition, I felt as if I could sprout wings and fly. Even the fact that this was the abyss, the furthest place from the sky, could not deter my joy.

Fortunately, it wasn’t even *much work.* It was quite literally akin to a dog finding a bone on a morning walk.

‘Thank god this is still around. Under normal circumstances, this is subject for immediate disposal as a classified level 3 national secret.’

In a good mood, I dug my fingers through Azzy’s hair and pet her. “You’re sooo cute! How can you be this good?”

“Woof! Woof!”

A normal person would probably be wary if someone suddenly hugged them and called them cute. However, Azzy was a dog who knew nothing of doubt or suspicion. She felt happy even at empty compliments.

Barking happily, Azzy turned back towards me and asked a question. “Do you like walks now?”

“Just for today. I love walks.”

“Woof? Love?”

“It means you really like something.”

“Woof! Me too! I love walks!”

「**Love…?**」

They said that a full belly was usually a cause for generosity. I felt even more benevolent with my heavy pockets. Even this good-for-nothing dog looked rather adorable today. Smiling happily together, we walked out of the ruins.

“Yeah. Keep acting nice like this in the future too.” “I’m always nice!”

“Don’t lie. Every time you do not like something, you would bare your teeth and growl.”

“Growl?”

Acting as if she had never done so, Azzy pretended not to know what I was talking about.

***No, she might have actually deleted her memory of doing so. Dogs are shameless animals after all.***

‘Hah, it’s a good thing that there is a human like me who remembers everything clearly.’

I showed my teeth at Azzy and made a growling noise. Azzy cocked her head and raised her tail, and followed my actions.

“G-Grrr?”

“Yeah. Don’t growl like that from now on. And don’t use your teeth either. Don’t try to bite me as well. Even if you have a problem, use your tongue. Got it?”

“Woof!”

“I’ll take that as a yes.”

「**Don’t use teeth… Only use your tongue…? Is he…?**」

As I was having a serious conversation with Azzy, I felt a rush of bloodlust directed towards me.

「**Light clothing. Has he already…? No, I followed them as soon as I knew, so there mustn’t have been enough time**」

The Regressor was glaring at me with murderous intent. ‘Huh? Bloodlust? Why?’

As I was in shock and unable to react, the Regressor clutched the blade behind her.

「**Anyway, he attempted it, right? Yeah. I’ll kill him**」 “Wait-wait-wait-wait!”

I grabbed Azzy’s shoulders and thrust her forward, placing her between me and the Regressor. Ignorant to the fact that I had just used her as a shield, Azzy just blankly stared at the Regressor. Cowering behind Azzy, I shouted out in a panic.

“I don’t know what you’re thinking, but it’s all a big misunderstanding!” “What’s the misunderstanding?”

“Everything! Starting with your dirty mind! Everything is a misunderstanding!” “Dirty? I’m the dirty one? Not you?”

“Yes! You’re a pervert who thinks everything is about weird stuff like that!” ***Ah, she took out her blade.***

I stood behind Azzy as best as I could and continued shouting.

“People who are perverts, think everyone else is a pervert just like they are! Just what kind of a person do you think I am?!”

With a cold gaze, the Regressor replied. “An animal.”

“That’s just not true!”

The Regressor was having some really weird thoughts right now. The accusation she was throwing at me was so outrageous that I felt more confused than angry. ***I mean, I’ve been framed for a lot of things in my life, but all my years, I had never been accused of bestiality. Regardless, she’s immediately going to kill me for that? She’s even worse than the Military State!***

As the Regressor slowly approached me, I screamed with all my heart.

“With a dog? Don’t be so weird. What kind of sick individual would even consider having a sexual relationship with a dog?”

The Regressor delved into her memories, recalling a couple of people in her mind. They were probably people who had attempted such vile acts.

‘Fuck, I guess the end of the world *will* erode human sanity. You shameful subhumans of humanity.’

I put my palm to my head and retorted.

“I know. There are people in the world who have twisted desires that cannot be understood with the normal human mind. But not me! I’m a normal guy with normal tastes!”

“…You keep treating Azzy like a dog.”

The Regressor pointed at Azzy whose shoulders I was still holding on to. “Are you doing that on purpose, or do you actually think so?”

“What?”

“Azzy isn’t a dog. She’s the Dog King. A Beast King who adopted the form of a human.”

Azzy looked towards me and the Regressor with an empty look on her face; her large shining eyes and a face full of curiosity, panting as if she had just finished a race. She was a girl with luscious blonde locks.

She resembled a healthy girl who was a little hyperactive. ***At least that’s how she looks.***

***However—***

“Trainee Shei.”

“Do you understand now? You kept treating her like a dog, but she’s actually the —”

“Are you crazy?”

As the Regressor flinched at my outburst, I shoved Azzy right in front of her. Azzy had her eyes wide open as I moved her around.

“Why don’t you say it, Trainee Shei? Is Azzy a human?!” “What? What are you…”

“Answer me! Is Azzy a human? Is she beautiful?”

“Uhh, uhmm…”

At my relentless interrogation, the Regressor started murmuring in a defensive manner.

“Sh-She has the form of a human, doesn’t she?”

“Did I ask you that? So what if she has the form of a human? Do you get horny when you look at Azzy or something?”

“No! O-Of course not!”

“If you think that way, then why do you think I would be any different? Are you disregarding my basic morals and dignity that much?”

“W-Well…”

「**Y-You’re overly close to her and also the only guy here…**」 ‘So you’re accusing me because I’m a guy?’

I was at a loss for words.

***Before Azzy is considered a female, please remember that fundamentally, she is a dog!***

***Wait, you’re supposed to be pretending to be a guy as well!***

It was so outrageous that I couldn’t even get mad. I usually tolerated insults, but to disregard my basic human dignity was going too far.

“Trainee Shei, listen closely.”

I found myself at a point where anger had turned into tranquility. After letting out a deep sigh, I directed my sermon at the Regressor.

“Let’s say there’s a person who tries to play fetch with another human, and another person who asks how their day has been. Who is the normal person here?”

“Th-That’s… The person who asks how they’ve been.”

“So you know. Now, between a person who tries to play fetch with a dog and another person who tries to ask a dog how its day was, who do you think is the normal person here?”

“W-Well…”

「**She’s a dog, but—**」

‘So you’ve admitted it yourself. Why are you getting mad when you know the answer yourself?’

I glared at the Regressor.

“Yes, exactly! It’s normal to treat a dog like a dog! You don’t ask a dog, ‘Hello, how was your breakfast?’”

“B-But—”

“Is it because Azzy has the form of a human? Oh, so that means I can assume you think of Azzy as a human, right? With your perverted eyes, you’re pretending to treat Azzy like another human, trying to get to her body?”

“N-No! I’m—”

“You’re a man as well! Just like me! Actually, you’re even more suspicious than

I am! Why are you always talking to dogs like they’re people and stalking me? Are you getting jealous? Is that it?!”

“Of course not!”

“Anyone can say that. Have you seen your own actions?!” 「**Ugh, if only I wasn’t cross-dressing…!**」

The Regressor who was currently pretending to be a man, was not able to come up with a rebuttal. I took a step forward, confident of my victory. Azzy, whose shoulders I was still holding on to, just seemed to think of the whole thing as a funny occurrence.

“Do you understand? You’re the weird one here!”

Logic always professed the truth. Even the Regressor knew it. She knew that I was right. That I was the normal one here. Faced with my attacks involving facts and logic, the Regressor had no choice but to take a step back.

“Woof?”

Of course, Azzy, who couldn’t understand sentences which were longer than two phrases, was just staring between me and the Regressor. However, even that just proved she was innately a dog.

Dogs were dogs at the end of the day. To the Regressor who had forgotten such a simple fact, I let out a finishing blow.

“You’re the weird one for thinking so much about the small talk you have with a dog! Do you understand now? I could tell Azzy a hundred, or even a thousand times that I love her! Even if I don’t actually have emotions like that towards her!”

However, at that moment, I had forgotten a very important fact.

Azzy was not only a dog, but the Dog King that the world itself had appointed as a representative of their species to communicate with humans. She didn’t really understand what I really meant, but she could still hear my words.

“Arf?! You don’t like me?!” “Huh?”

With suspicion swarming in her bubbly eyes, Azzy stared up at me from the ground. Her usually playful tail was now lying limp, and her perky ears were drooping downwards.

“You… hate me then?”

“Oh, Azzy, that’s not what I meant. It’s hard to explain—” “Woof?”

‘Wait. Hm. Let’s think about my next course of action. The Dog King is a dog. I can’t use any complex words. Even if I try to push this off for later, she wouldn’t accept that answer. So, whatever I say to the Regressor as a part of my argument, Azzy will consider it my actual thoughts.

‘With all that in mind, I had a few options. Do I push the Regressor even further so I can tease her at the risk of Azzy liking me less? Or do I retain a nice relationship with Azzy and let the Regressor go?’

***…Well, the answer was quite obvious. I am not stupid enough to give up on the future for a moment of fun.***

Making my decision, I opened my arms wide and made a huge smile at Azzy. “Of course, it’s a lie. I like Azzy a lot.”

“A lot?”

“Yes. A lot. You’re the nicest and cutest girl around.”

I wasn’t lying. With the scary vampire and the bloodthirsty Regressor around, Azzy was infinitely more helpful. If she could read the mood better and had a little bit more self-control… it’d be optimal.

But dogs were dogs. Her behaviour was something that I would need to accept. “You… like me?”

“I do like you.”

‘I don’t know if she’s just naive or stupid, but her mood changes so easily with a few words. Oh, it’s probably both. And yet humans loved dogs exactly for their purity and stupidity, so it was a little ironic to berate her for it.’

While I was still grinning… “Woof! Do you love me?” 「**…Love?**」

***Why did you have to ask me this now when someone is watching? Did someone do something to you? In the first place, who taught a dog a word as meaningless as love?***

***Oh, they’re both because of me.***

***Shit. I’m suddenly being pressured by my past actions.***

Trying to ignore the cold gaze that the Regressor had suddenly regained, I slowly nodded and answered Azzy’s question.

“Yeah… I do.”

I could tell a dog that I loved it a hundred times.

***I mean, some people love their dogs more than they love other human beings. However… it was something hard to do in front of the Regressor’s cold, judgmental eyes…***

But it was inevitable. I gulped as I sensed the suddenly rather serious mood and opened my lips once again.

“I love you…”

Hearing that made Azzy’s tail wag. People said that words held no weight, but Azzy took even the smallest things with no prejudice. She smiled and thrust her arms towards me. Leaning onto me, she allowed me to support her weight. It was an indication of trust that dogs only showed to people they were really close

to.

Pure happiness filled her face. Grinning like an idiot, Azzy’s eyes were smiling as well.

“Woof! I like you too! I love you!”

“Yeah…”

***I never thought I’d end up whispering words of love to a dog in my life.*** Azzy hopped into my arms. With a trembling hand, I stroked Azzy’s head. And like always—

「**I… need to keep my guard up against that man**」

The Regressor’s wariness had only intensified.

***Man, stop. Stop looking at me with those judgemental eyes. And stop fidgeting with the handle of your blade. I’m not that kind of person.***

***I just like her as a pet.***

「**If he is an official of the Military State and volunteered to come to Tantalus… it would certainly explain his strength. That’s why I need to stay conscious of him**」

‘Oh. I mean, I can relate to those feelings. If I heard someone bragging about how they had intercourse with an animal, I’d be disgusted too. And although I don’t have the power to do so, I wouldn’t immediately try to kill them even if it were true. Don’t you think executing someone for loving an animal was a bit too harsh?’

「**…An organization in the Special Forces of the Military State. The secret society that tried to control the Beast Kings and bring them under the Military State’s will in order to topple nearby countries**」

‘Wait, what? A secret society?’

「**The Human Regime. Experts in training beasts, and racists who despised**

**beastmen more than anything else. He’s likely one of them**」 A series of images flashed through the Regressor’s head.

In a past that had not been recorded, the Regressor stood in a vast plain. Her blade was lighter than a feather as she held it in her hands, yet her heart felt as heavy as stone.

The guilt that she wasn’t able to stop the apocalypse weighed heavily on her. The feeling of helplessness that she wasn’t able to change anything. She had failed in this life as well. Everyone around her would perish yet again. And she alone would open her eyes once again…so that she could go forth to find another future.

Next to the Regressor, dozens of people had been lined up, cowering in fear. Cold sweat dripped from their hands, and their eyes rattled from fear, but they couldn’t even dream of escaping what awaited them.

If their adversary was human, they could beg for mercy, plead for their families’ safety even if they themselves perished…

However, what they were facing now was not bound by human rules. They had the form of a human, but they were not humans in essence.

The horizon quaked. A rampage of frenzy, led by a couple of stray leaders, were the harbingers to thousands of beasts—enough to be described as a layer that coated the earth.

They had some differences. Some were two-legged, while others had four. Some of them were closer to humans, but had ears or tails of different animals. Beastmen. They were the offspring of a sin committed long ago by humanity. The offsprings of beasts—born as humans yet treated as outcasts—used everything they received to try and annihilate humanity.

In front of them, human figures that produced an extraordinary aura led the charge.

The Beast Kings.

The leaders who each represented an entire race.

The Beast Kings were mighty, but they did not seek violence. They were ultimately those who reflected the will of their whole race; diplomats who were meant to convey the will of their people to humans.

However, if the species they represented had decided to rebel against humanity, if the will of the species was clear enough…

Then the Kings would enact the will of their people.

Those who could no longer bear the persecution and hatred, driven by their fierce instincts, stood at the front lines.

Blood, fire, cinder.

The Beasts armed themselves with steel and fire to attack humanity… The combination of their wild instincts and weapons was almost like a calamity.

Furthermore, those who made up the majority of the beastmen that had revolted against humanity were—

The Beast King who had gathered the largest army to slaughter humanity was—

The creaking past then faded away, and I was brought back to reality. What I had just seen was so vivid that I could still see traces of it in my mind’s eye.

The event that I had witnessed was the future, and at the same time, it was the past as well. The same past that the Regressor had experienced, and the same one I would go through if nothing were to change.

I rested my trembling hand on Azzy’s head as she leaned into me. Her ears fluttered like the wings of a butterfly as they raised slightly at my touch.

The Dog King who had her mouth shut as she embraced me—the leader of the trusty, lovely dogs—was smiling while covered in blood in a future that would arrive soon.

「**The existence of Beast Kings is preordained by the world. Even if I killed her here, another one would be born elsewhere**」

***Why did I overlook the Regressor’s worries?***

***There is no way the concerns of someone who had experienced so much would be overboard.***

「**As long as Azzy seems emotionally dependent on that man, I can’t remove him. And it’s also hard to verify if he’s part of the Human Regime. But right now, he’s the most likely candidate to cause some rampage. I’ll need to keep my eye on him**」

***Makes sense**.*

Azzy’s body was warm to the touch and soft. Her hands which had slightly bent backwards to prevent her claws from hurting me provided insight into her desire to not hurt anyone. She definitely didn’t do that consciously, so that desire to be nice was likely just deeply ingrained into her very instincts.

***Just what caused that thoughtful hand to lead the way towards bloodshed?*** It seems the future was much harsher than I had initially expected.

- **Necessity Is the Mother of Invention  **

Despite the Regressor’s cold gaze, I managed to convince her using all sorts of words. She was still wary of me, but it seemed like she had decided to wait for now seeing as how she loosened her grip around her sword.

After heaving a sigh of relief, I suddenly became curious about something. “By the way Trainee Shei…”

“What?”

“What are you here for? Did you follow us?”

“I didn’t follow you! I just… happened to come here looking for you.”

The Regressor tilted her head to the side with her arms crossed while Chun-aeng floated above her head.

“Tyrkanzyaka asked me about what you said. That thing you said about teaching her about the times. What time it would be at.”

“Huh? We’re actually doing that?”

「**You suggested it?!**」

The Regressor looked bewildered. I felt guilty so I nodded along. “Alright, alright. I’ll go prepare for it now.”

“Try your best. I hope it goes well.”

As she turned away from me, the Regressor added one more thing. “Of course, I’ll be listening in as well.”

‘Me, teach? I’ve been living off the streets. I don’t have the knowledge to teach someone.

‘I may be one of the most educated people here, but at best I’m a graduate from

a standard public elementary school and dropped out of military middle school. I did get more education than a typical security level one citizen the moment I entered military middle school, but that was only because I read the mind of the kid with the second-best scores. If it wasn’t for my mind-reading cheat ability, my education would’ve ended at elementary school.’

***Oh, by the way. The reason I read the mind of the kid with the second-best scores instead of the first was because I was the person who had the highest scores in the school.***

***It wasn’t done with my own studying of course. I just borrowed a little help from everyone during tests.***

***O students, lend me your strength.***

***I’d like to thank and apologize to every student who had their rank pushed back by one because of me.***

However, because of my insanely high test scores, all of my instructors thought that I would be the genius to drive the Military State forward by an entire generation. But I completely failed the practical portion of the entrance exams to military high school, so I dropped out, trying to run away. And now, I ended up like this.

As any person who wasted their life often did, I reminisce about my school days. “Maybe those days were the golden age of my life.”

I missed the days when I lived so freely just with the ability to read minds.

***Albeit the issue is that I still can’t think of what I’m going to teach Tyrkanzyaka.***

As I unconsciously fidgeted with my pockets, I realized something.

“Oh! I’ll just use this!”

‘This will do.’

The first three floors of Tantalus were the cells meant to hold the prisoners.

Typically, those words would remind you of an atmosphere that felt confining and cramped.

However, as a prison with prisoners but no guards, Tantalus was a little different from the typical stereotype of prisons, in the sense that the stone walls were broken and the metal bars were bent in all kinds of directions.

Walls and bars didn’t suffice as an obstruction for the prisoners that were sent here. The metal door was now in the shape of a metal croissant, and the bars that were bent whichever way reminded me of wet pasta. One of the walls had an intricately made spear—three metal bars twisted together—embedded into it, and another cell had a perfectly smooth square hole cut out of it.

‘Fuck. It seems that the prison was nothing more than a bunch of toys to the criminals placed here. That’s terrifying. Just how did the workers that had to live amongst these criminals survive? Oh, right, they didn’t!’

Having solved the mystery, I made my way up the stairs.

The fourth floor was where the workers resided. It was also where I was staying since I had nowhere else to go. The doors didn’t lock, but they opened and closed properly, and there were still a few amenities like a kitchen and a place to do laundry.

I headed to the worker training room at the end of the fourth-floor hallway. “Welcome!”

There, the ‘trainees’were waiting for me.

A coffin, having pushed aside the chairs to make room, was floating in the air. The Regressor was hunched over on a chair, while she crossed her arms and legs. She glared at me the moment I walked in. Azzy was lying down on the floor playing around. I doubted she actually came to learn.

With everyone’s focus on me, I headed to the lectern. It was a small class consisting of a dog, a corpse, and a person, but I couldn’t help but be a little nervous as I stood in front of them. I took a deep breath before I began to talk.

‘It’s fine. I’ve done this plenty of times. It’s not any different from swindling

people into buying worthless things.’

“I’ll start by establishing the goals of this class. From what I’ve seen the past two days, all you superhuman beings severely lack some common sense. If we were to release you as you are into society, you’ll have a hard time fitting in. And if that happens, you’ll end up back here again. So…”

｢**Just a moment.**｣

An eerie voice creeped out from within the coffin. The vampire seemed rather annoyed.

｢**…Why do you wear such casual clothes when you’ve come to teach?**｣ “Huh? What’s wrong with my clothes?”

The standard supplied button-up shirt and a pair of shorts that had built-in underwear. I was casually dressed, but this was fairly common.

However, to a thousand-year-old boomer like the vampire, even that was not formal enough.

｢**Teaching is like a river. It flows from a high place to be received at the bottom. So the one who teaches must always maintain a certain air of authority and dignity. How can anyone be inclined to learn from someone so poorly dressed?**｣

“This is ridiculous, I can’t believe I’m being criticized for my attire by someone who lives in a coffin.”

｢**…That is—**｣

“I know, I know. It’s like your wheelchair. I get it, I’m not going to berate you for that.”

- *Cough! Cough!*

The Regressor’s face grew red as she violently coughed in reaction to my statement.

「**…A ‘wheel-chair’? You’re saying something I don’t understand again… but what is this ‘wheel-chair’? I feel as if I am being insulted**」

‘Alright. Note to self: never explain what a wheelchair is.’

I gripped the lectern with both arms and shouted towards the coffin.

“And Trainee Tyrkanzyaka, there’s a clear reason as to why I came here dressed like this. Please do not doubt the teacher when the class hasn’t even begun yet.”

｢**Alright. Show me. I hope your words serve more purpose than just excuses.**｣

“Don’t get too surprised.”

‘I’ll show this outdated vampire the greatness of modern technology.’ I stretched out my left arm.

“Citizens of the Military State undergo a recording of their biological statistics when they reach the age of eighteen. Height, weight, body shape, bone structure, and even the length and width of our limbs. All of these things are recorded and engraved into our bodies.”

I turned my wrist to face the class. A peculiar hole was in my left wrist. The dip made from digging out flesh looked as if it were meant to hold something.

“Because of this, the Military State has the most advanced identification system. Utilizing it, they’ve made a few useful inventions.”

I dug out the object Azzy and I had found in the control room. The small dark- blue marble was just the right size to perfectly fit the hole in my wrist.

I hooked most of them by now. The Regressor who already knew what it was, and the vampire who had questioned the strange hole in my wrist.

They had a rough idea of how to use this marble.

“The Military State’s science is the best in the world. This is the pinnacle of alchemic technology, the clothing technology of the Military State.”

With those words, I fit the small marble into my wrist with a resounding click. Instantly, blue filaments began to cover my body.

Along my skin, firm, strong fibers made the base structure. Thin blue strands weaved together to form layers in between. A garment was instantly tailored based on an alchemic pattern. Strands became fabric, and fabric became a clothing material that piled ontop of itself, step by step.

I did a quick twirl in place because I felt like I needed to. On my third way around, a warden’s uniform perfectly tailored to my body had covered my entire body.

Quickly taking the form of a trained warden, I saluted, according to the State standard.

“The Clothing Packet.”

It only took ten seconds for the stiffly ironed suit to cover my entire body. The invention of the century used the information recorded in your own biological data to transform into perfectly fitting clothes. Even if it ripped or got messy, all you needed to do was change it back into a marble and wipe it clean.

It was one of the best inventions, even among the seven great inventions of the Military State.

I boasted as I lifted up the collar of my brand-new clothes.

“With the invention of the Clothing Packet, citizens of the Military State were freed from the curse of laundry. Also, they spent less money on buying new clothes. A person only really needed a couple clothing packets, and they could keep reusing them.”

｢**Interesting.**｣

“Now, do you understand why I came so lightly dressed? I wanted to show you the Clothing Packet in action. It’s better to just wear the standard underwear beneath.”

Hums of amusement echoed from the coffin, but I could hear the vampire’s

thoughts clearly.

「**That’s amazing…! The world really has changed so much!**」 ***I knew she’d love it.***

It was a stereotype that old people disliked new technology. In reality, they were often willing to spend more time exploring it. Curiosity was something that existed within everyone, regardless of age.

The only issue was that, for some reason, old people tended to revert back to analog ways, saying ‘It had a nicer feel to it.’

However, the vampire’s attention was now solely focused on the Clothing Packet.

“A warden’s uniform… Hmph.”

Shei’s expression soured after seeing my outfit. Then, the vampire asked the Regressor.

｢**Child, you didn’t have any hole like that on your wrist.**｣ “I won’t ever get that kind of stuff.”

The Regressor shot back in a moody manner.

“That’s for surveillance. It’s a product of authoritarianism, made by the desire to track and control every single citizen.”

｢**Authoritarianism?**｣

“It means they monitor every citizen. You need a Bio-receptor to enter major roads or buildings. And if someone goes into the wrong place, the authorities can use it to arrest them immediately.”

｢**…What is the issue with that?**｣

The Regressor—who had only experienced the future—probably didn’t understand, but the vampire was from a totally different time. One with absolute monarchy.

‘Do you think human rights were a thing back then? If they were, the vampire probably wouldn’t have died at such a young age when she was alive.’

After the Regressor realized that, she clicked her tongue. “Besides, there’s an even bigger issue with the Bio-receptor.”

- **Out of Necessity, Did the Mother Invent  **

The Regressor continued speaking as she glared at me.

“Once you carve the Bio-receptor into yourself, your body becomes tied to the State regardless of your will. They will be able to monitor your every move, and the other nations will be extra cautious of you. When going into nations that are hostile to the State, like the Empire or the Federation, you could be put under constant surveillance.”

“I don’t think that really matters unless you’re about to defect to another country.”

I replied while glaring back.

The Regressor kept glaring daggers at me.

It’s alright to throw shade at the State because it’s a place where the innocent are thrown into the abyss by baseless accusations.

***But I won’t stand having my Bio-receptor talked down like that! I don’t use the Bio-receptor and Clothing Packet because I’m patriotic to the State. I only use them because they’re convenient!***

“…And the Bio-receptor in itself is a liability. A magical device that can affect my whole body is no different than branding a slave in the past.”

***What? Are you trying to say that I’m a slave? That ticks me off. I’m a guy who also wants the State to perish.***

Countless curses directed at the State were plastered onto my lips as soon as I was chucked into Tantalus.

***If I counted up the number of laws I’ve broken just from living in the back alleys, it would be way more than the number of laws you’ve broken. Scamming, gambling, embezzlement, blackmailing, bribery, etcetera!***

***Yet you treat me like a slave of the State? No, I’m the State’s number one***

***criminal! My crimes might be slightly different from yours, but I’ve got the quantity on you!***

I snapped at the Regressor and started ranting.

“That’s a bit too much. If you say it like that, nothing in this world is truly safe. You could say that a tight suit is a suffocating prison or that a necktie is a leash on my neck. If you can say things like that, then we should also confiscate every fountain pen in the world because ‘the pen is mightier than the sword’.”

The Regressor settled back down in her chair and just glared daggers at me.

Her scorching animosity stabbed me. It was an unchangeable disdain; an annoying but ever-present shadow that hung over thirteen deaths. The stains of living in the darkness of the State could never be washed away.

“…You should *know*.”

The Regressor shot an icy gaze filled with the emotions of her many regressions. Her heart was so cold that it seemed as if it would never warm up again.

Her gaze scared the life out of me that I mumbled inwardly.

‘Oi, State. What on earth did you do that the Regressor would hate your very existence? You should be careful. It’s a big world out there, and you could meet an individual capable enough to single-handedly destroy countries. For example, a Regressor with infinite lives.’

‘You should try to not torture everyone too hard and be nicer to them in the future…’

“The first thing the State did with the Bio-receptor was… torturing people.”

A faint trace, a short but bold flashback. I read her mind as she reminisced about her past. Once upon a time, on her first regression. The fragmented memory of those times was recalled.

All that could be felt were fragmented moments of suffering.

The only thing in her mind were two words: ‘It hurts’. It covered the last page of

her memories like a nasty piece of performance art. Along with an old and weathered scar.

I gulped.

‘Hey, State? I think it’s too late for you.’

***I should get out of this country ASAP. Adios. See you never.***

“The Bio-receptor is an archaic avatar that was forcefully opened via alchemy and magic. It’s a clone of my body. If you forcefully open the Bio-receptor and insert specialized poisons… Heh, then you could stimulate the feeling of pain without any drawbacks. When electricity touches your body, it flows all throughout it. The metal rod was definitely placed on my wrist, but my foot would start convulsing. *Hmph*. The State didn’t just invent a plain old convenient item. With haste, they first and foremost invented weapons… and torture devices.”

The air felt extremely heavy. To the point where the vampire forgot what she was about to say, and even the dimwitted dog Azzy looked up and raised her tail.

The vampire stayed silent.

However, it was clear where her thoughts were. If one’s mind were like a compass, hers would be pointing at the Regressor.

The Regressor, feeling dejected, laid out her painful thoughts.

「**Everyone who’s been through that has died. Even I couldn’t handle it and took my own life. After that day, I’ve always carried around poison so that I could die a painless death every time. I’ll never forgive the State…**」

I fucked up.

If I had known this earlier, I would have never impersonated a warden. I didn’t read such painful thoughts like this before!

‘I was wondering why she swung first and asked questions later. I should be thankful that I’m still alive.’

The Regressor clenched her fist to the point of having her hands tremble, she clenched them hard enough for her hand to start leaking blood.

“You still think the Bio-receptor is useful?”

「**If this man is fully aware of the State’s evil but still sides with them, it would only be a matter of time before we clashed**」

The Regressor was assessing me right now. If I made any hasty decisions, I could be confirmed as an ‘enemy’and receive the suffering for all of eternity. After all, this wasn’t her last life.

She wouldn’t believe me if I said I was only acting as a warden all this time now, would she.

***If that’s the case…***

‘I’m putting on a voice. I’ll change my current cheery voice in an instant like I’m flipping personalities.’

Through the rapid change, I reset my mindset.

With a snap, I forcefully cut the conversation off just like that. If conversations were ‘living beings’one would be dead right about now. I’ll pretend that the previous conversation just didn’t happen.

Thus, I ended the conversation and started another. After preparing myself, I started from the top.

“When the Bio-receptor and Clothing Packet were first created, they weren’t in the list of considerations.”

I said with a confident but calm voice.

I told an old story that I made it sound as profound as possible.

“The first person to come up with the Clothing Packet was an old woman with a daughter-in-law. The old woman, who was trying to run a small clothing shop, looked upon her clumsy daughter-in-law with pity as she did the laundry and sewed till she started getting blisters. The daughter-in-law’s bright smile always carried some concerns. But to help her son continue on with the family business, she had to sew and do the laundry. The old woman tried to think of a way for her daughter-in-law to get used to all the housework, but couldn’t think of any decisive ideas. In the meantime, the old woman got a clothing request from a noble.”

From a distance, even steep hills and sharp rocks were small details that built a grand and beautiful scenery. No story could capture all the suffering and tears shed.

However, by capturing just some of the emotions, any story could be moving.

“The noble ordered the fanciest and most beautiful clothes the old woman could make. The old lady was dumbfounded by the order, as the clothes they wanted her to make were so full of different ornaments and embellishments that you wouldn’t be able to say that it was something you could wear. She knelt down and answered.”

“I am not skilled enough to create something like that.” “Make it.”

“The cloth and threads will tangle like that of dogs in a fight. Because of this, you wouldn’t be able to take it on and off.”

“Not a problem. Make it.”

“The threads of the cloth are so fine that, if it got damaged, even a child wouldn’t be able to fit their hands in between to fix it.”

“Not a problem. Make it.”

“The different silks and cloth are intertwined into one that, if it were soiled, you wouldn’t be able to wash it with water nor can you wash it away with a wet brush.”

“Not a problem. Make it.”

“So you would want clothes that you could not fix, wash, nor wear again?”

“Only once. It’s to be worn only once. After that, it will be taken off, torn, and soiled. Your concerns are unnecessary.”

“That is not clothing. It is a sewn abomination.” “Not a problem. Make it.”

“It was a fickle nobel’s crazy order. A difficult order for anyone in the world. It could have been rejected because it was too bizarre or because it was impossible to fulfill. But the old woman who was thinking about her daughter-in-law saw this as a golden opportunity of inspiration.”

At first glance the clumsy daughter-in-law had no aptitude for laundry or sewing. However, the old woman held back tears as she looked at the bloodstained cuffs.

“If the clothes are disposable, then neither laundry nor sewing would be required.”

It was the perfect solution.

“It was impossible, right? A new pair of clothes made every time you needed to wear something; having to take them off when you needed through alchemy. That is absurd. It can’t be easy. It would be way too difficult. The old woman would have had to spend the rest of her life developing it. She would have had to keep sewing until her sight blurred out. Even with her talented hands, her age was catching up. Her shaking and weakening hands were full of needle holes. She was no longer in her prime. There was no time for even the blood to dry.”

I intentionally took a breath and looked again at the hole in my wrist. To tell the story of this tiny hole.

“The essence of the Bio-receptor. It’s the wound from the needle. The Clothing Packet is the one invented for the daughter-in-law. It’s just that the State… engineered it into a magic tool.”

All evils of the world were created by the State.

However, such evils in the past were from a much smaller but precious heart.

I walked towards the Regressor and took off the Clothing Packet. It broke apart and was sucked into my left hand as if someone had pulled apart all the fibers from the clothes. Just as larvae created cocoons or spiders wrapped their prey, the slender fibers came together to form a small marble.

After a couple of steps, I was back to my standard shirt and shorts.

The Clothing Packet popped out of my Bio-receptor. I took it and stood next to the Regressor’s desk.

“I can’t represent the State, and you wouldn’t be able to speak for all who were tortured. But even so, I would like to ask for your forgiveness.”

‘I didn’t do the deed, but I am a part of it. I will apologize for the things I have done.’

In that sentiment, I grasped the Regressor’s hand to find her Bio-receptor. The Regressor sat in silence as she watched my every move.

“For the world’s noblest of deeds, borne of boundless compassion. For the committed sins that are set aflame in the scorching depths of hell.”

With that, I got her finger where her Bio-receptor would be—

***Huh, there’s nothing there. There’s no hole. Only her smooth skin.*** Puzzled I asked.

“Hey. You don’t even have a Bio-receptor.”

‘Why isn’t it there? That’s strange. I thought for sure I saw her getting tortured in her memories.’

As I was wondering, the Regressor pulled her hand back in a panic. “N-No, wait.”

「**I only got tortured on my second regression, when I didn’t know a thing… I didn’t even get one this time around**」
