It was ridiculous, yet somehow it had happened.

But because of that, a clear divide had formed between the top students and the rest.

Some felt unworthy to approach them, some were scared, and others had their own reasons.

The top students, for their part, hadn't approached anyone else either, adding to the awkward atmosphere.

Even though it was only the second day, it was clear that if things continued like this, the class would end up divided.

It was technically the Apex's responsibility to handle such things... Not that Azriel seemed to notice or care.

"Alright! I'm going to talk to them!"

One student suddenly declared, standing up with his fists clenched in determination.

The others looked at him with admiration.

"You can do it!"

"Yeah, we believe in you!"

The girls cheered him on, boosting his confidence.

Just as he was about to take his first step...

"Everyone, take your seats. Class is starting."

Instructor Salvator walked in.

*****

Azriel watched Instructor Salvator approach the desk at the front of the class and take a seat, holding a stack of papers.

Salvator dropped the papers onto the desk with a decisive thud.

To his left, Azriel noticed Celestina finally sitting up properly, though she still looked exhausted.

"You good?"

Celestina attempted a smile but failed. She shook her head lightly.

"...I'll be fine in a few hours."

Azriel nodded in understanding. Unlike Azriel and Lumine, who were both Grade 3 intermediates, Celestina didn't have the same physical stamina.

Despite this, she had performed better than most students, even though physical activities weren't her strength.

'Maybe I should buy her a bottle of water later.'

It would be a good excuse to spend some time together.

"Ahem!"

Instructor Salvator cleared his throat, drawing the students' attention.

"You can be relieved that I'm not like Instructor Ranni, throwing void worms to scare you, or like Instructor Solomon, who probably drained every ounce of energy from you. Instead..."

Instructor Salvator picked up the bundle of papers he had brought with him and smiled kindly.

"We'll start this class with a test!"

A collective groan rose from the students, their spirits deflating further.

"I... I can't lift my hands!"

"I can't feel them... I think I need to see a doctor!"

Instructor Salvator ignored their complaints and began distributing the papers.

His eyes briefly met Azriel's, and he nodded slightly.

Azriel returned the nod.

'I guess that's his way of congratulating me on becoming the Apex?'

After handing out the papers, Instructor Salvator returned to his desk.

"You have the entire class period for this test. If you finish early, you may leave until your next class."

Suddenly, Salvator's eyes locked onto Azriel's.

"Except for you, Cadet Azriel. I need you to stay behind and follow me to the headmistress's office after class."

Murmurs spread through the classroom at Salvator's announcement.

Azriel looked confused but nodded in acknowledgment.

"Silence." Salvator warned. "If I catch anyone talking or trying to cheat, I will send you to Instructor Solomon."

At that, the classmates paled and hurriedly focused on their papers.

"Azriel... Do you know why Headmistress Freya wants to see you?"

Celestina's voice was a quiet murmur beside him.

Azriel's lips twitched at the question.

He glanced subtly around, noting that it seemed Instructor Salvator was either pretending not to notice or genuinely didn't hear.

"It must be because of the... incident with Lumine yesterday."

Azriel replied quietly.

Celestina didn't respond, instead focusing intently on her test.

The education system had advanced significantly in this world compared to Azriel's previous one, but he wasn't behind. As Leo, he had excelled in academics, and as Azriel, he hadn't slacked off either.

Knowledge was power—a belief Azriel held firmly.

He scanned through the test and saw that it was straightforward.

What does "mana stabilization" refer to?

a) The process of increasing mana flow

b) The process of balancing mana to prevent fluctuations

c) The act of storing mana in a physical object

d) The ability to generate mana from external sources

'The answer is B.'

Define "mana flux."

Mana flux refers to the variation in mana flow or concentration within a given area over time. It can occur due to natural events, changes in the environment, or other factors.

After 20 minutes, Azriel completed the test.

He sighed and dropped his pen, glancing up to see Instructor Salvator watching him.

Azriel managed a wry smile.

'Yeah... I'll wait.'

It didn't seem like the meeting with the headmistress would be about what happened yesterday.

Chapter 60: Mission
The cafeteria was fairly empty when Celestina, Yelena, and Lumine arrived after finishing their test before the class ended.

As they sat down, Celestina took a seat opposite the two, watching as they both eagerly dug into their food.

Celestina smiled slightly.

She had already interacted with a few people at the academy.

Thanks to Azriel, she was grateful to count Lumine and Yelena—along with Azriel himself—as her friends.

Azriel's presence had made it easier for her to grow closer to them.

Normally, most people would want to befriend her for their own gain, something Celestina understood well.

She, too, had made connections to potentially bring allies to the Frost Clan in the future.

But Lumine and Yelena were different—they didn't seem to care about using her or Azriel for their own purposes.

'Though I should do something about the other classmates...'

She mused, noticing the distance between herself, Azriel, and the rest of the class.

If Azriel wasn't going to address it, she felt she should at least try, especially if the situation remained unresolved after their trip to the Void Dungeon.

She didn't blame Azriel for not trying to unite the class; if he didn't want to, that was fine with her.

"Hey, do you think Azriel will be alright?"

Lumine's voice interrupted her thoughts, his tone tinged with concern.

'What a good friend Azriel has found...'

"He told me it's probably because of everything that happened in the Celestial Arena,"

Yelena frowned slightly.

"But then, shouldn't Lumine have been called as well? Besides, we followed the academy's rules, didn't we?"

Even if on the first day, they hadn't broken any rules since everything had happened within the Celestial Arena.

'She's right.'

Even though Lumine hadn't fought, he was still heavily involved, and in a way, Yelena was too.

It made sense that they should have been called to the Headmistress's office as well.

'Is Cadet Vergil there too?'

Celestina wondered.

After Azriel left, Vergil had also disappeared, and no one had asked what happened between them.

She was a bit worried that Vergil might try something to get revenge on Azriel.

'Azriel should be able to handle it though...'

She doubted that anyone among the first years could gain an advantage over him.

"Maybe it's not academy-related?"

Lumine suggested, breaking into her thoughts.

Before Celestina could respond, a voice cut through the air.

"Master isn't with you guys?"

A silver-haired boy approached their table, glancing around as if searching for Azriel.

'His name was Nol.'

Celestina recalled. Yesterday, Nol had disappeared the moment Azriel did, without them noticing.

"He had to stay in class, waiting for Instructor Salvator since he was called by the Headmistress, apparently." Lumine informed him.

"Oh..."

Nol's shoulders slumped in disappointment as he stood in front of their table.

"Did you get to leave class early as well?" Yelena asked curiously.

Nol shrugged. "No, I was about to fall asleep, so I asked to go to the bathroom."

"I see..." Yelena murmured, unsure how to respond.

"Your name is Nol, right?"

Nol turned his head towards Celestina and nodded with a small smile.

"Master spoke a lot about you, Princess Celestina."

"O-Oh, is that so?"

Celestina didn't know how to respond to that.

'What did he tell him?'

She wondered, curiosity piqued.

But she quickly cleared her throat, pushing the thought aside.

"Cadet Nol... can I ask what your ranking is?"

After the academy session yesterday, she had tried to find someone named Nol in the top 100 but had no luck.

"Me? I'm ranked 237th."

"I see..."

'So I was wrong...'

Celestina felt a bit disappointed.

She assumed Nol was hiding his rank, especially recalling how Azriel didn't dismiss his words lightly and how confidently Nol had spoken about taking on Kai.

"...You're ranked 237th?"

Lumine asked quietly, seeming doubtful for some reason, causing Celestina and Yelena to frown.

Nol turned towards him, still smiling but with his eyes slightly narrowed.

"That's correct. Oh, and—"

Suddenly, Nol bowed his head slightly.

"I would like to thank you for being friends with Master. It seems that Master cares about you a lot, Lumine."

Lumine got flustered at the sudden gesture and Nol's words.

"P-Please stop bowing! I should be the one thanking him for wanting to be friends with me."

Nol laughed, while Yelena giggled. Celestina, however, narrowed her eyes.

'He diverted the topic...'

"I didn't think Master would have any friends at the academy, knowing him."

Celestina tilted her head, while Lumine and Yelena looked on curiously.

"Cadet Nol, how did you meet Azriel?"

Nol's smile widened at Celestina's question.

"Please, just call me Nol."

Celestina nodded.

"As for how I met Master? That was in the Void Realm."

""!!""

Their eyes widened in surprise at his words.

Celestina knew Azriel had been in the Void Realm, unlike Yelena and Lumine, but she hadn't known that the boy in front of her had been there too.

'He... he was with Azriel there?'

"So the rumors are true... he was actually in the Void Realm?"

"And you were with him?" Yelena added, drawing in a sharp breath.

Nol merely nodded.

"Well, I don't think it's right for me to speak about that time unless Master gives permission. Anyway, I should probably go before Instructor Juliet gives me another scolding."

With that, Nol grinned and walked away, leaving the three of them to process what they had just heard.

'If he was with Azriel there... there's no way he's just ranked 237th.'

Celestina was certain of that.

But how strong was Nol?

She didn't know.

*****

After class, Azriel followed Instructor Salvator towards Headmistress Freya's office. Neither spoke as they made their way inside.

Behind her desk sat Freya herself, but what caught Azriel's attention was the presence of others in the room.

Solomon was leaning against the wall, Ranni was there as well, and Juliet stood next to Freya on her right.

All except Freya turned toward him—Ranni smiling, Solomon grinning, and Juliet narrowing her eyes.

Azriel walked forward and, without waiting for an invitation, sat in the chair across from Freya.

Instructor Salvator closed the door behind them and took his place on Freya's left.

Freya stopped writing on the paper before her and met Azriel's gaze with a blank expression.

"Do you know why I called you here?"

Azriel cracked a small smile.

"I don't."

Freya narrowed her eyes, remaining silent for a few seconds before speaking again.

"...You're lying." She said, a sigh escaping her lips.

"Not that it matters anymore."

Azriel showed no reaction, maintaining his composure as he continued to look at her.

'She should smile more... I'm sure she'd find someone with a face as pretty as hers.'

He mused, though he wisely kept that thought to himself.

Freya's tone shifted to one of formal authority as she addressed him.

"Cadet Azriel Crimson, I, Freya Selene, Headmistress of the Hero Academy, have called you here to personally assign you a mission during your upcoming trip to the Void Dungeon."

Chapter 61: High-risk, High-reward
A deafening silence followed Freya's words.

Everyone except Solomon and Azriel looked shocked at her.

It was understandable—assigning missions to students was something that normally only happened in the second year, not the first.

"What is the meaning of this, Freya?"

Juliet was the first to break the silence, scowling.

"It's exactly as I said, Juliet. I'm personally assigning Azriel a mission when he goes to the Void Dungeon. We have reason to believe that Neo Genesis will attempt an attack then."

"...!"

Juliet, Salvator, and Ranni all reacted to the news.

"So, they've finally decided to make their move...!"

Salvator furrowed his brows.

"But why Cadet Azriel!? Even if he is the Apex of the first years, the reason missions are only given to second years is because they've already built up enough..."

Juliet trailed off, realizing what she was about to say.

Experience.

Something everyone in the room knew Azriel already had.

"Still... even then, wouldn't a third-year or someone else be more suitable for the mission?"

Juliet wasn't convinced, and Azriel understood her hesitation.

Freya shook her head.

"Unfortunately, I can only trust the people in this room for this mission..."

Ranni narrowed her eyes slightly.

"By trust, do you mean...?"

Freya nodded.

"Yes. There's a high possibility that Neo Genesis has infiltrated the Academy itself."

Freya continued,

"At the Void Dungeon, only Ranni will go with a few other instructors I consider the least suspicious. Solomon, you'll be secretly trailing behind. Make sure no one notices you."

The other instructors seemed displeased, and Salvator spoke up.

"What about our classes? If an attack is imminent, I'd rather be there to prevent any tragedy from happening."

Freya shook her head.

"No. I'll need you and Juliet with me when the attack occurs, to ensure we can eliminate the threat completely."

They seemed reluctant but nodded nonetheless.

The possibility of infiltration within the Academy was extremely dangerous and needed to be addressed when the enemy's guard was down.

"As for you, Cadet Azriel..."

Freya turned her attention to him, who had been listening quietly the entire time.

"You will be responsible for handling the situation inside the Void Dungeon, ensuring the safety of the students until Solomon and Ranni deal with the situation on the surface."

Azriel raised an eyebrow slightly.

"Quite the heavy responsibility on my shoulders, don't you think?"

Though, in truth, it was something he had expected.

Juliet nodded in agreement.

"I concur. What if they encounter a situation that Azriel cannot handle on his own?"

Freya didn't respond immediately, only meeting Azriel's gaze.

He sighed.

"I've already taken measures. As long as Instructor Solomon and Instructor Ranni ensure that no advanced or higher-level threats enter the Void Dungeon during the attack, I should be able to manage."

Juliet furrowed her brows.

"Already taken measures? So you knew about the attack, like Freya... how?"

Azriel smiled slightly.

"That information is classified, Instructor Juliet. If you have an issue with that, you'll have to take it up with the head of the Crimson Clan."

In other words, his father. A challenge she obviously couldn't accept.

She could only click her tongue in frustration, while Solomon stifled a laugh.

"This will be dangerous, but it's also a good opportunity for the students to grow. Cadet Azriel, I expect you to lead them to the fifth floor with the help of the other instructors when the attack happens," Freya continued.

The fifth floor was different from the first four floors—it was a safe zone, meaning no Void creatures would spawn there.

It was also a place where humans had established a town for trade and business.

"This still seems too reckless to me... A lot could go wrong in the Void Dungeon. Even if they come out stronger, they could just as easily lose their lives," Salvator said, still unconvinced.

Freya sighed.

"We don't have a choice. We need to protect the students and civilians both on the surface and within the Void Dungeon. Our resources are stretched thin, and we can't fully trust anyone outside this room. The only advantage we have is that we're prepared—we'll stop their blades mid-swing."

Salvator eventually nodded, though with a solemn expression.

"If that's your decision, I'll follow your orders."

"Gods! The both of you seriously need to calm down! We have the upper hand here, knowing beforehand that they'll attack. Nothing will go wrong."

Solomon urged, trying to ease the tension in Salvator and Juliet, who were visibly on edge.

Ranni, who had been listening quietly, finally spoke up.

"Freya, you mentioned that I'll be dealing with them on the surface alongside Solomon, which means I won't be able to assist the students in the Void Dungeon during the attack, correct?"

Freya didn't respond, but her silence was answer enough, making Ranni bite her lip.

If Azriel and the other instructors could hold off the enemy long enough, either by Salvator, Freya and Juliet clearing up the Academy or by Solomon and Ranni finishing the fight on the surface, they could secure a victory.

But...

How long could they hold out?

Ranni, like Salvator and Juliet, seemed uneasy about the plan.

"Haa... If you three are going to act more afraid than the kid in front of us, who should be the most concerned but isn't... we might as well throw in the towel,"

Solomon said suddenly, causing everyone to snap their heads toward him as he clicked his tongue.

"What? It's not a terrible idea. We could put an end to this right now—eliminate the spies in the Academy, cancel the trip to the Void Dungeon, and prevent any student deaths. We could also alert the four great clans and the government to tighten security around the capital. But doing this would, of course, tip off Neo Genesis that we've discovered their plan.

But hey, at least no one would die, even if we sacrifice our advantage in capturing them."

A tense silence followed Solomon's words. It was clear that he was in a foul mood, frustrated by the others' reluctance to fully embrace the plan.

"Instructor Solomon is right, you know?" Azriel finally broke the silence.

"We won't get another opportunity like this with Neo Genesis. Can we fully trust the instructors who'll be with us in the Void Dungeon? Probably not. Do we have another choice? Yes, we do..."

Juliet and the others looked confused.

"What do you mean by another choice?" Juliet asked.

Azriel smiled slightly.

"Trust your students... instructors."

Their eyes widened slightly at Azriel's words.

"Cadet Lumine, Cadet Vergil, Cadet Kai, Cadet Celestina, Cadet Anastasia, Cadet Yelena... and even the other first-year students. Have you seen so many first years capable of rivaling second-year students? Do you think this happened by some stroke of luck? No, it didn't. They've all reached this point through their own skills.

Time is finally about to move forward again... but it won't if we're too afraid to take risks."

A high-risk, high-reward plan.

Trusting the students and instructors in the Void Dungeon to handle themselves.

Surviving until one of the instructors in this room could reach them.

'Diamonds are formed under pressure... and so will they.'

Freya nodded.

"Azriel is right. We're assuming the worst—that the instructors might betray us—but I highly doubt that. It's just that no one outside this room can be fully trusted like you all here. The Void creatures on the first four floors should be manageable for this year's students, something that any other first-year students wouldn't be able to handle.

Perhaps it's better that this attack happens, to give them a real challenge."

Solomon grinned broadly, pleased by Azriel's and Freya's words, while the others sighed and nodded in agreement.

Azriel smiled slightly as well.

'...A bunch of crazy people here,' he thought, putting the lives of students at risk. But everyone knew that this might be necessary—to show them the true cruelty of the world.

With everyone finally convinced, they began meticulously planning the details, ensuring there were no gaps, no oversights, and that every contingency was accounted for.

If this worked...

They might deliver a devastating blow to Neo Genesis.

Chapter 62: Laughter
Ever since arriving in this world, Azriel had accomplished many things—most of which he was proud of.

Yet, there were still countless goals he needed to achieve, challenges that lay ahead.

Some would be difficult, but none so pressing as the one task he had neglected since his arrival...

Training.

It wasn't that he was weak.

With the combined memories of Leo and Azriel, he was a formidable fighter.

He was strong.

But not strong enough.

And so...

Bam—!

Bam—!

Bam—!

The sound of Azriel's fists slamming into a heavy bag echoed through one of the Academy's gym rooms.

Red lightning crackled around his knuckles, intensifying the force of each strike.

He was dressed in black pants and a matching black t-shirt, both soaked with sweat.

It was 4 a.m., and the room was empty, save for him.

Unable to sleep, Azriel had decided it was time to train—really train—for once.

And what exactly was he working on?

Bam—!

Bam—!

His speed.

One of the first things he noticed upon arriving in this world was that he was faster than most of his peers.

He could even keep pace with Caleus, who also relied on his speed and was stronger than Azriel.

As long as it was a contest of skill, that is.

But if there was one thing Azriel wanted to improve, it was his speed.

Even in his previous life, when he played games with Nathan, the first thing he'd always upgrade was his speed stat.

It was a childish thought, perhaps, but wouldn't it be cool to defeat an enemy before they even realized what happened?

He had tried to do just that with Cadet Kai back at the Celestial Arena, but he wasn't fast enough.

He wanted to be faster.

Bam—!

Bam—!

He kept punching and kicking the bag, each strike aimed at increasing his speed.

'Faster... I'm not fast enough.'

And so, the only sound that filled the room was the relentless pounding of Azriel's fists against the punching bag, driven by an unyielding desire to become faster.

*****

The entire night, Jasmine had been buried in work required of her as the student council president.

With the new school year, she also needed to recruit new members from the first-year batch.

It was now 5 a.m., and she finally decided to take a break.

It wasn't that being the student council president was so demanding that Jasmine couldn't even sleep.

It was just that… she procrastinated.

Too much.

Now, she had to sacrifice her sleep to actually get some work done.

Realizing that it was too late to go to bed, she decided to head to one of the gym rooms. If she wasn't going to sleep, she might as well train.

And since it was still early in the morning, no one would be there.

The corridors were empty and dimly lit as she arrived in front of a familiar gym room. Reaching the door, she opened it and stepped inside.

Bam—!

Bam—!

"Huh?"

As soon as she entered, she heard the sound of something heavy being struck.

Curiosity piqued, Jasmine walked toward the source of the sound.

When she found it, her eyes widened in shock.

Bam—!

"Not"

Bam—!

"Fast"

Bam—!

"Enough"

Bam—!

At the far end of the boxing area stood a familiar figure she instantly recognized.

His back was hunched, and a pool of sweat had formed around his feet.

Drip... Drip...!

But it wasn't just sweat.

Blood was seeping from his knuckles, which crackled with red lightning.

Bam—!

Bam—!

Bam—!

Ever since his return, Jasmine had noticed how much Azriel had changed. Whether that was for better or worse, she wasn't sure.

He smiled, he laughed, he sighed.

"More."

Bam—!

But she had never seen him like this before.

His face was filled with determination, frustration, and… anger.

Such a raw expression made everything else he'd shown her seem almost unreal.

Her feet felt rooted to the spot as she watched him punch and kick the bag faster and faster.

'Why isn't he getting tired? How long has he been here? What about his mana—hasn't it depleted yet? …Why is he pushing himself so hard?'

Nothing made sense.

There was something about him that made Jasmine unable to tear her gaze away.

The longer she watched, the more she began to realize what he was doing.

He wasn't just punching the bag.

No.

The tips of his hair were…

White.

It was incredibly hard to notice, but when Jasmine did…

Her blood ran cold.

'He's… he's crazy!'

Cra...Crackle—!

There.

She saw it.

Only for a few seconds.

The red lightning… turned white.

It was just for a moment, but in that moment, she felt like she was dreaming.

'He… he's merging his affinities!?'

It was such an absurd thing to witness.

And yet…

She couldn't move a single step forward.

All she could do was one thing.

Watch.

.

.

bam—!

.

.

Ten minutes.

.

.

Bam—!

.

.

Twenty minutes.

.

.

Bam—!

.

.

Thirty minutes.

.

.

Bam—!

.

.

Forty minutes.

.

.

Bam—!

.

.

One hour.

.

.

At exactly one hour, it happened.

Bam—!

The entire punching bag… turned into ice.

Jasmine's mind went blank.

At the same moment, Azriel collapsed onto the floor, breathing heavily and coughing.

Jasmine snapped out of her daze and moved toward him, but then...

"Hahaha!"

Azriel laughed, ignoring his own state and sitting amid the pool of blood and sweat.

No.

He just kept laughing.

He watched as the punching bag turned to ice upon contact with his lightning.

Azriel's eyes shone brightly, his laughter echoing through the room.

Jasmine's mind froze once again.

The expression on his face…

She had never seen such joy from him before.

It was the first time since his return that she had seen him so... happy.

"I did it! I actually fucking did it...!"

He continued to laugh, like a child discovering something wondrous for the first time.

Jasmine could only blink, unable to comprehend what to do.

When his laughter finally subsided, he fell back, still breathing heavily.

Yet the smile never left his face.

Noticing Jasmine's gaze, Azriel turned his head towards her.

The air between them instantly grew awkward.

Azriel's mouth moved as if he were struggling to find words.

"..."

"...H-how long have you been watching?"

Jasmine wanted to lie and say she hadn't seen anything, but...

She couldn't bring herself to lie.

She attempted a smile, but it faltered instantly.

So, she told the truth.

"An hour."

Chapter 63: The Crimson Siblings
After the unexpected turn of events, Azriel and Jasmine decided to head back to his room. Azriel took a shower, freshened up, and brewed some tea for both of them. Now, they sat side by side on the couch, sipping their tea in silence.

It was awkward.

Both were at the top of their respective years—Azriel ruling the first, Jasmine the second.

The Crimson Siblings.

Yet...

'...Dammit. I really messed up.'

He never imagined Jasmine would be there, watching him the entire time. He'd been so focused on getting faster while merging his affinities that he'd completely forgotten about his surroundings.

And now...

Azriel felt extremely embarrassed for the way he had acted.

But who could blame him?

What he had accomplished was thought to be impossible.

Merging affinities.

Having dual affinities was already incredibly rare—so rare that the names of those who possessed them were well-known.

The idea of merging affinities was beyond belief.

No one had even considered it...

Until Lumine, of course, but that was supposed to happen in the future.

Yet Azriel had done it now.

In the present.

And not just with any affinities, but with lightning and ice—two that were thought to be incompatible.

"...You really did something incredible, you know that?"

Jasmine finally broke the silence, causing Azriel's lips to twitch.

"Not really... It's just something anyone could achieve if they actually tried."

It wasn't a lie.

Perhaps if there were more people with dual affinities, they could have proven that merging was possible much earlier.

Still, it had taken four void generations to finally confirm it.

Jasmine, however, shook her head.

"Most aren't crazy enough to put themselves through what you did just to see if it's possible."

She smiled suddenly.

"At least I can die peacefully after seeing you accomplish it!"

Azriel averted his eyes, taking a sip of his tea.

"Please forget about my five seconds of happiness."

"Impossible."

'Tch...'

An instant denial.

"By the way... why were you using a punching bag?"

Azriel didn't look at her. In fact, he didn't dare to.

"Well, bec—"

"Don't lie."

Jasmine cut in, as if she knew he was about to.

"What? How would you even know if I was going to lie?"

"I just do."

Azriel narrowed his eyes at her before sighing and looking ahead again.

"...Multitasking."

"What?"

Jasmine gave him a puzzled look, as if she'd misheard him.

"You heard me, dammit. I said I was multitasking!"

Jasmine blinked at him.

"I haven't trained much these past months, so I was multitasking—trying to become faster while also merging my affinities. Honestly, I didn't think I'd manage to do it in just a few hours."

Azriel grumbled. Merging his affinities felt almost too easy, but he understood why it happened so quickly.

Being blessed by a god had its advantages.

"I see..."

For some reason, Jasmine looked at him gently, making him feel a little awkward.

'What is up with her...?'

But before he could think any further, his vision suddenly tilted, and he found himself staring at the ceiling.

The next second, he felt the back of his head resting against something soft.

"Huh?"

The sound of Jasmine's laughter echoed as she watched his confused expression.

"You've depleted your mana, and you're physically and mentally exhausted, Azriel. Get some sleep."

Azriel glared slightly at her.

"I'm fine. I don't need sleep. I've still got class in a few hours."

Jasmine shook her head and began combing her fingers through his hair.

"It's okay to take a break once in a while..."

Azriel looked at her, confused.

'Break? All I did was train today...'

Jasmine continued.

"You think I don't know about your nightmares?"

His eyes widened.

'Did Dad tell her?'

"My hopeless little brother, you've been doing so much that doesn't make sense to me... but it's obvious you're tired. Take a break from the academy today and spend some time with your big sister!"

Azriel narrowed his eyes slightly, murmuring.

"My dear sister, are you trying to use me as an excuse to neglect your responsibilities?"

Jasmine looked away, refusing to meet his gaze.

"N-no! Of course not. I wouldn't dare do such a thing... definitely not."

She nodded to herself, as if convincing herself, while continuing to run her fingers through his hair.

A sigh escaped Azriel's lips.

If he skipped today, he was sure Instructor Ranni would let him off.

She might think he was preparing himself for the mission or something along those lines.

"...You really are my sister, you know."

Jasmine looked confused.

"Wasn't that obvious?"

He chuckled.

"I meant that if it were anyone else messing with my hair, I would have ripped their hand off."

Her hand hesitated for a moment before she continued.

"T-then it's good that I'm not just anyone."

Ignoring her wry smile, Azriel closed his eyes, another sigh escaping his lips.

Silence settled between them, but this time it wasn't awkward. It was peaceful and comfortable as they enjoyed each other's company.

*****

Jasmine kept staring at Azriel, who had his head on her lap, a smile on her face.

She hadn't been lying when she said she was trying to neglect her duties. In truth, she had already finished almost everything.

All that was left was recruiting new members, but that could wait.

After all, what could be more important than spending time with her little brother?

Nothing!

Jasmine wanted to ask about what had happened on his first day at the academy.

She had heard the rumors about the fight he had in the Celestial Arena, where some cadet had used his name, but apparently, Azriel hadn't done anything after that.

She couldn't understand why he let it go.

Whenever she thought she had figured out that Azriel was trying to rebuild his reputation, he would let something like that slide, something that could potentially harm it.

But today...

She felt like she was beginning to understand him better.

She hadn't seen his guard down like this since he reunited with their parents.

"Jasmine."

Azriel's voice suddenly snapped her out of her thoughts. His eyes were still closed, but he had called her name.

Jasmine furrowed her brows slightly.

"What is it?"

Since his return, Azriel usually called her 'dear sister' in a playful way, which she found cute. But now, hearing him use her name, she knew it must be something important.

"...If I were to do something stupid, would you hate me?"

Jasmine's eyes widened slightly at the question. It was an unexpected one, especially coming from Azriel.

'Something stupid...'

She knew that, coming from him, 'stupid' likely meant something more dangerous.

It didn't take her long to come up with an answer.

Jasmine parted her lips.

"If you did something stupid, I'd get angry... but—"

She suddenly smiled brightly.

"I would never hate you."

For a few seconds, Azriel didn't say anything, letting the silence settle between them.

And then...

"I see..."

Azriel smiled genuinely, a small laugh escaping his lips.

"What's so funny?"

She didn't think there was anything humorous about her answer, so why did he laugh?

But Azriel merely shook his head slightly, not offering any explanation, making her even more curious and slightly annoyed.

'Ugh, and here I am being so kind to you...!'

Why would he leave her in suspense?

Just as she was mulling over this, she suddenly noticed the rhythmic breathing of Azriel, indicating that he had fallen asleep.

Forgetting about her inner turmoil, she gazed down at the sleeping Azriel.

'Hehe, I feel like I could watch your sleeping face forever...'

But she lied.

After ten minutes of gazing at his face, her own eyes grew heavy, and...

Jasmine also fell asleep.

It was safe to say that neither of the Crimson siblings attended the academy that day.

Chapter 64: 527
There are a total of 527 students in the first year of the Hero Academy.

In the second year, that number drops to 203—a decrease of more than half.

And in the third and final year...

98.

Once again, more than half of the current third-year students have dropped out.

This means that, in total, the Hero Academy has 828 students across all three years.

There are reasons why more than half of the students drop out each year.

Some realize that being a hero isn't their true dream, some find they aren't cut out for it, and some get expelled.

But for the majority, the reason is fear.

Fear of death, fear of void creatures, or fear of villains.

Of course, this doesn't mean that only 828 students across all three years are aiming to become heroes.

There are other academies in Asia and throughout the world.

But the Hero Academy in Asia is the most renowned...

For one obvious reason.

The students here must face their fears head-on to become heroes.

Currently, outside the academy gates, Azriel stood with his class and Instructor Ranni, watching the other first-year classes board the buses.

Today was the day... they would enter the Void Dungeon.

Perhaps it was better to say that Azriel was standing at the very back of the class, unnoticed by anyone, while Instructor Ranni was checking to see if everyone was present.

It wasn't that he was avoiding them; Azriel simply found it peaceful to watch from a distance, enjoying the moment without any eyes on him.

What amused him the most was that more than half of his class was talking to Celestina, Lumine, and Yelena.

It seemed that on the day he was absent due to Jasmine, the barriers between the top students in his class had started to dissolve.

They were all smiling and laughing, listening to Lumine, who appeared a bit embarrassed.

A smile unconsciously crept onto Azriel's face as he watched them.

Speaking of yesterday, when he skipped class, he had, for the first time since arriving in this world, managed to sleep for eight hours without having any nightmares.

'I can see why Nathan used to make such a fuss about lap pillows...'

They were indeed a cure for everything.

Though he wasn't planning to ask for another lap pillow from his sister anytime soon.

"Glad to see you made it, Cadet Azriel... I thought you might have chickened out, given your absence yesterday," Instructor Ranni's voice reached his ears, pulling him out of his thoughts.

He turned to see her standing next to him, also gazing at the students.

Azriel looked away uncomfortably.

"...I didn't chicken out, I just... overslept."

Instructor Ranni chuckled softly at his words.

"Well, as long as you just overslept, it's fine. There's still time before everything begins... If you need to talk about anything, I'm here."

A grateful smile appeared on Azriel's face as he shook his head.

"Thank you, Instructor Ranni, but really, there's no need to worry. I've already steeled my mind for what's to come."

"...I see," she replied, her voice tinged with sadness.

"Don't you feel like all of this is unfair? You... these students, all of you are kids, yet you're forced to train and fight because we adults are too weak to handle it ourselves. Instead of enjoying your youth, you're forced to face these horrors, all because most of us are too afraid."

Azriel turned his gaze toward her, noticing the melancholic expression on her face as she watched the students enjoying themselves.

"Instructor Ranni... you're facing these horrors too, as are countless other adults. It's true that some adults are afraid to fight, but I don't see it as unfair. Becoming a hero is a choice. Perhaps some here were dealt an unfair hand, but in the end, everyone here is willing to be a hero, not forced to."

It felt like he might be a little wrong, but the core truth remained: most heroes choose this path, fully aware that without them, humanity would fall.

Becoming a pillar of humanity wasn't something forced upon these students.

Instructor Ranni hummed in response.

"Perhaps you're right... Still, I wonder when the day will come when children can just... be children."

"That day will come."

Azriel said softly.

"But the first step to achieving that is winning the battle ahead."

Instructor Ranni laughed quietly.

"You're certainly confident in your words, Cadet Azriel..."

One of the buses filled up and departed, while another arrived.

Instructor Ranni started walking toward it, likely to speak with the driver.

"You should join your classmates and have fun with them, Cadet," she said, leaving those words behind as she walked away.

Azriel watched her go.

"...I'm good. I'd rather be an observer for today."

After about 10 minutes, Instructor Ranni ordered her class to board the bus.

The bus wasn't like the ones Azriel remembered from his previous world—it looked more modern, if he had to pick a word.

It wasn't flying or hovering in the air, but it still had wheels. The bus had tinted black windows and a sleek black body kit, with the interior being a stark snow-white.

As they walked toward the bus, Azriel's classmates finally began to notice his presence.

"Ah, Azriel, you made it!"

Lumine shouted, his voice carrying over the noise.

Unfortunately, Lumine couldn't catch up with him as he was pushed inside with the others.

Azriel could only awkwardly wave back, mouthing "later" as they were herded onto the bus.

Instructor Ranni, still outside, was glaring at them, making it clear she didn't want to wait any longer.

Though the classmates had grown more comfortable around Celestina, Lumine, and Yelena, they still kept a few steps further away from Azriel.

He sighed inwardly, not blaming them.

It wasn't like he had been the most social person, nor had he done anything to improve his reputation since entering the academy.

Instead, he'd made a mess of things on the first day, souring his standing with them.

As Azriel was about to be one of the last to enter the bus, a sudden commotion erupted among the other classes who were still waiting.

"It's really her..."

"Why is she here?"

"Will she join us?"

Furrowing his brows, he turned around and noticed a student walking toward them from the academy gates.

'They're right... What the hell is she doing here?'

His face darkened as he looked over at Instructor Ranni, meeting her gaze.

"...It seems the headmistress wanted to take some extra precautions for the students' safety. That's why she's here... as a guide."

'Freya...'

He should have seen this coming.

This must be her way of getting back at him for outsmarting her before.

Azriel turned around, coming face to face with their "guide."

"I thought we already had enough quality sibling time, my dear sister."

Jasmine chuckled.

"My little brother, there's never enough quality sibling time."

'She's enjoying this...'

His mood soured even more.

It wasn't that he didn't trust Jasmine, but naturally, he was worried about his sister being here when the attack happened.

Though she should be able to handle herself, he still couldn't help but worry and silently curse Freya.

Jasmine didn't say anything more to Azriel. Instead, she greeted Instructor Ranni and boarded the bus.

'I should have never overslept...'

In the end, he could only curse himself for what happened yesterday.

Chapter 65: Void Dungeon
"Whoa... so this is the Void Dungeon."

"I've seen videos of it online, but still..."

"It's different when you see it with your own eyes."

The students exclaimed as they stood in front of a massive, sunken hole that seemed to stretch endlessly into the abyss.

They stared down into the darkness, trying to peer through the void, but there was nothing but an eerie blackness.

Yet, all around the dark pit, there were shops, stalls, and buildings with people going about their day, enjoying themselves as if the abyss didn't exist.

And it didn't bother them at all.

They were used to it, and the presence of students in white uniforms didn't draw much attention either; it was expected.

Every year around this time, the first-year students of the Hero Academy would come to the Void Dungeon, and during this period, no one else was allowed inside for the next five weeks.

The students were scheduled to stay for five weeks, tasked with conquering the first four floors of the Void Dungeon.

Naturally, with 527 students divided into 20 classes, they wouldn't all be entering at once.

It would be impossible to send them all in together—unless they somehow intended to conquer the entire dungeon at once, which was clearly beyond the capability of any student, or likely anyone else alive.

Instead, they followed a staggered system: the first three classes would enter the dungeon first.

Two days later, two more classes would follow.

In the next week, once a few classes had conquered the first four floors, three more classes would enter in the same manner.

"Alright, everyone, be quiet now."

Instructor Ranni's voice cut through the air, commanding the attention of every student as she and the other instructors stood in front of the cadets, positioned between them and the Void Dungeon.

Instantly, all the students fell silent and straightened their backs, facing her with full attention.

Even the people nearby stopped what they were doing to listen, finding the spectacle entertaining, no matter how often it happened each year.

"You've all been briefed on how this works, so I won't waste time going over that again. Instead, I'll get straight to the point. Normally, we would have one of the instructors supervising and acting as a guide, but this year, we're changing things up. Cadet Jasmine, please step forward."

As her name was called, the students began murmuring among themselves, watching as Jasmine stepped forward to stand next to Instructor Ranni.

"Cadet Jasmine will be guiding you all to the fifth floor. Once the first class reaches the fifth floor, she will move on to guide the next class in the same way. The instructors will only be present for emergency situations, but don't rely on them."

Her eyes narrowed, and the students broke out in cold sweats, not daring to avoid her gaze.

"If you try something stupid, don't expect them to save your life."

Many of the students gulped audibly at her words, though they couldn't shake the suspicion that she was bluffing—after all, they couldn't just let students die.

"Also, don't expect Cadet Jasmine to fight for you. She will only guide and intervene if necessary. Other than that, you're on your own."

The cadets nodded solemnly, taking in every word of Instructor Ranni's warning.

"Now that this is clear, let's get started. HCS-1, HCA-1, and HCB-1—you three classes will be the first to enter the Void Dungeon today. For now, all other classes should return to the hotel. You three, be back here by 8:00 PM sharp. The instructors will be waiting. And enjoy those luxurious beds while you can—once you enter the Void Dungeon, you'll definitely miss them."

As if spurred by her last warning, the cadets hurried back to the hotel, eager to savor what might be their last moments of peace for the month.

Naturally, Cadet Jasmine followed the students as well.

*****

"My dear sister, shouldn't you be resting? We only have two hours before we have to leave."

Azriel's voice was exaggerated as he stood in front of Jasmine, who was lazily sprawled on his bed.

"Eh? But I'm resting here by soaking up my vitamin A."

Azriel blinked, puzzled by her reference to vitamin A.

He shook his head with a sigh.

Sitting down on the bed, Jasmine propped herself up and moved closer to him.

"Are you going to be okay?"

Azriel looked at her, slightly confused by the question.

A smile soon spread across his face.

"You're worried about me entering the Void Dungeon..."

Jasmine nodded.

"Yeah, I mean, the last time you faced void creatures..."

"Was when I was in the Void Realm and Europe."

Azriel finished her sentence, and she reluctantly nodded in agreement.

She must be worried about the scars from his time in the Void Realm and Europe—experiences that would understandably leave anyone traumatized.

Azriel gave her a reassuring look.

"Thanks, but I'll be fine. Besides, you aren't going to let anything happen to me, right?"

Jasmine nodded firmly.

"Of course, your dear big sister will protect you from any danger!"

Her bright expression was cheerful, and Azriel chuckled.

'I'll do the same for you then.'

Suddenly, without warning, obsidian-like panels flashed in front of his vision, causing him to open his eyes slightly.

"...."

"Is something wrong, Azriel?"

Azriel shook his head, smiling at her.

"It's nothing. I was just a little disappointed that I still can't merge my affinities for a longer period of time."

Jasmine nodded in understanding.

"You need to practice more. Besides, using both affinities at the same time consumes a lot of mana."

"You're right."

Azriel nodded absentmindedly.

His focus was no longer on her; instead...

it was on the quest right in front of his eyes.

[• Main Event: Birth of Genesis]

[• Main Quest: Defeat and capture the leader]

[• Side Quest: Defeat and capture the leader's allies]

[• Side Quest: Prevent any cadets from dying in the Void Dungeon]

[• Event Experience: Gainable]

[• Quest Reward: Gainable]

-> [Mask of Deceit]

Azriel glanced at the panels in front of him, a disappointed sigh escaping inwardly as he refrained from smiling sadly.

He had anticipated this and was beginning to wonder when the system would make its appearance.

He started to think the system might be malfunctioning.

'Well, better late than never...'

The quest rewards were tempting, but only if he completed the main quest.

And the main quest was an audacious one, even for him.

'So a piece of soul armor instead of a skill this time...'

The side quests appeared to be as challenging as the main quest.

Azriel had prepared beforehand, but the system likely anticipated that, which was why it assigned such difficult tasks.

'At least I'll gain a lot of event experience from this.'

If all went according to plan, he should be able to complete at least the side quests.

Even though the deaths of students would contribute to the protagonist's development, Azriel needed to delay that type of character development for now.

From the book, he knew that the deaths here would do more harm than good.

It wouldn't benefit anyone.

The world didn't revolve around Lumine, even though the God of Life favored him.

The more people who survived, the better.

What was crucial right now was thwarting Neo Genesis's plan.

'Still... it's not the same main quest Lumine had in the book.'

He was curious if Lumine had a similar main quest now.

Not that it mattered much.

''ll trust you to complete the side quests for me, oh hero.'

Chapter 66: Drowning
"Lumine, are you all right? You've seemed out of it ever since we arrived at the hotel," Yelena asked, her concern evident as they stood in front of the Void Dungeon.

There were still 30 minutes remaining until 8:00 PM, but even now, she could see that most of the cadets from the three classes were already gathered, including Cadets Nol, Vergil, and Kai.

The last two didn't appear to be causing any trouble.

Cadet Kai was chatting with a group of his friends—the same ones who had confronted Yelena and Lumine on the first day—while Cadet Vergil sat alone on the ground, eyes closed.

No one dared to approach him.

Celestina was nearby, engaging with other classmates and seemingly becoming more popular by the second.

"Lumine? Are you listening?" Yelena asked again, tapping his shoulder.

Startled, Lumine snapped his head towards her.

"Huh? Oh! Yeah, sorry. I was just a little nervous about the Void Dungeon."

Yelena nodded, offering him a reassuring smile.

"If it's just the first four floors, I doubt anything will really be a challenge. Besides, we have Azriel and Celestina in our class."

Lumine nodded, trying to smile back.

"Y-yeah, you're right. Nothing will go wrong."

But despite his words, his mind kept drifting back to the system notification that had appeared the moment he stepped into the hotel.

When he checked the [Quest] tab, he found it.

The problem was... the quest wasn't anything like he had expected.

Lumine had assumed it would involve killing Void creatures or defeating the floor boss, but no. The quest was surprisingly straightforward, yet unsettling.

All it said was that he had to prevent any cadets from dying in the Void Dungeon.

If he accomplished that, he would be awarded 5,000 SP—System Points, which could be used to purchase a lot from the [Shop].

It was a ridiculous amount of points, which meant the quest was likely just as difficult.

The vagueness of the quest only added to his anxiety.

It was the first time he had received such an ambiguous task.

All he knew was that he had to save the cadets from dying.

But from what?

Lumine found it impossible to concentrate any longer.

Yelena didn't bother Lumine anymore as they stood together in silence for the next 20 minutes until...

"Yo, Lumine, Yelena! How have you two been?"

Both of them snapped their heads around to see Azriel approaching with Jasmine by his side.

"Ah, Azriel! I've been good, thanks," Lumine replied.

"Mm, me too. Thanks for asking," Yelena added.

Azriel wasn't alone, and next to him stood Jasmine. Lumine didn't dare to look directly at her, though.

For some reason, he could feel both Yelena and Azriel's sharp gazes whenever he glanced at her on the bus earlier.

His instincts screamed at him that making eye contact with her wouldn't end well, so he didn't take any chances.

Luckily—or perhaps not—Jasmine didn't seem to share that hesitation.

"It's nice to meet you, Cadet Lumine, Cadet Yelena. My name is Jasmine Crimson. Thanks for being friends with my little brother."

"A-ah, yes..." Lumine stammered.

"We should be the ones thanking him," Yelena added, a bit flustered by Jasmine's smile and politeness.

Azriel, however, furrowed his brows. "How did you know I was friends with them?"

Jasmine looked at him, confused.

"Why else would you greet them?"

"Because I'm a nice person?"

Jasmine stared blankly at him.

Azriel clicked his tongue.

"Fine, don't look at me like I'm some sort of monster."

Yelena and Lumine could only exchange wry smiles at the siblings' interaction.

Clap—!

Suddenly, a loud sound reverberated through the area, drawing all the students' attention toward the Void Dungeon.

Standing in front of it was Instructor Ranni, flanked by three other instructors.

Seeing them, everyone stopped talking and straightened their backs, adopting serious expressions.

"Now that everyone is here, I hope that means you're all prepared to enter the gates of hell," Instructor Ranni said with a smile.

Not many seemed to share her enthusiasm.

"Instructor Benson, Instructor Alicia, and Instructor Kevin will be responsible for supervising your three classes during the Void Dungeon, while Cadet Jasmine over there will be guiding you."

The cadets nodded, and Instructor Ranni looked pleased.

"Alright, I wish you all the best of luck."

Without warning, she suddenly disappeared before everyone's eyes, leaving many students surprised.

"All cadets, follow my lead. This will be the only time we instructors will talk to you. After that, remove us from your minds."

Instructor Benson warned.

The cadets looked at him wide-eyed as he suddenly stepped onto the black hole... yet he didn't fall. His feet were firmly planted on it.

The other two instructors followed, standing beside him.

Then, black light shot out from the hole, enveloping the instructors until they disappeared.

"What the hell...?"

"I swear I thought we'd have to jump down."

"Good..."

The students looked amazed and relieved.

"Alright then, let's do what the instructors said," Jasmine said, taking the first step onto the black hole.

Like a signal, all the other cadets—though some hesitated—started following her lead.

And then... they were all consumed into the Void Dungeon.

*****

It was strange.

If Azriel had to describe it, it felt like drowning—like being submerged in the deepest ocean, where the only sound that reached him was the echo of his own thoughts.

He was alone.

Utterly alone, with no one to talk to, no one to see.

The world around him had faded into an abyss of silence and darkness.

He couldn't breathe.

He couldn't see.

He couldn't speak.

He couldn't even move.

Yet...

It felt strangely peaceful.

As if staying in this suspended state, adrift between life and death, wouldn't bother him at all.

'Is this how death feels?'

He wondered, his mind drifting like a leaf on a still pond.

But then, suddenly, a force tugged at him, pulling him upward with a startling velocity.

It was like being shot out of the depths of the ocean, propelled by some unseen force—like a torpedo racing toward the surface.

In the next breathless moment, he found himself blinking, disoriented but standing above the same ominous black hole.

Only now, he wasn't on the surface anymore.

"Welcome inside the Void Dungeon, little brother."

Jasmine stood there, her excitement radiating through a bright smile.

Her eyes sparkled with a strange thrill that Azriel couldn't quite understand.

Around them, other students were scattered across the ground, some disoriented, others sick or paralyzed by fear.

The expressions of shock and terror were painted across their faces. Yet, amidst the chaos, a few, like Lumine, stood steady, their composure not as unshaken.

The instructors, nodded in approval at those who had managed to remain standing.

Their eyes missed nothing.

But Azriel didn't care about their judgment.

His focus was elsewhere.

His gaze swept across the vast expanse of the dungeon.

It was...

"Beautiful..."
