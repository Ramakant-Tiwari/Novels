It was clearly different from usual. Enkrid’s ears distinguished the subtle difference. The moment he heard it, he rolled to the side without hesitation.
‘I dodged it.’
The initial plan was to roll away and then shout. Enkrid couldn’t do that.
Swooosh.
He heard the sound of air being sliced behind him. There was no time to draw the dagger hidden in his bosom. He rolled forward again.
Swish, swoosh, swoosh.
Indescribable small noises kept coming. By distinguishing the direction of the sound, Enkrid barely, really narrowly, avoided the attacks. The blade tip grazed his thigh.
‘That was lucky.’
If he had made a mistake, his thigh would have been cut. Even a scratch was dangerous with this opponent. Would someone using poisoned darts not coat their blades? Rolling repeatedly, he dodged and bounced his body. The Heart of the Beast shone.
Despite the continuous dangerous moments, his heart cooled and settled. There was no need to get excited if it was just listening and dodging.
‘It’s okay. I can handle this.’
If he gave up on counterattacking, he could avoid it. The blade targeted his back, drawing a long vertical line. The opponent’s intent was clear.
To at least make it graze.
Enkrid rolled towards Vengeance’s bed, who still didn’t seem to wake up from this commotion. As he rolled, he pushed the bed with his shoulder.
Thunk.
A heavy impact returned to his shoulder muscles. Even though he rammed it with all his might, Vengeance didn’t wake up.
‘Poisoned dart.’
He wouldn’t wake up. It must be a paralyzing or sleeping poison, he thought.
“Persistent bastard.”
This time, perhaps in a hurry, the assassin muttered and kicked the ground. Enkrid, breathing heavily, gasped for air. The assassin, sensing his opponent’s labored breathing, thrust the knife in his right hand while throwing a poisoned dart with his left.
It was almost a deadly move. Despite his heavy breathing, Enkrid responded swiftly. He dodged the knife and blocked the poisoned dart by raising Vengeance’s arm as a shield.
Thunk, the poisoned dart embedded itself in Vengeance’s forearm. Seeing it blocked, the assassin hesitated, and Enkrid rolled towards the tent entrance. His heavy breathing was a ruse.
‘This is the Vallen Style Mercenary Sword, the feigned breath.’
It was a trick to create an opportunity by appearing to give an easy finish to the fight and exploiting the response.
It worked perfectly.
Rolling, Enkrid used the momentum to half rise and dashed towards the tent exit. The assassin lunged forward.
That too was a feint.
Enkrid headed for the tent wall instead. Drawing a dagger from his bosom, he aimed to slash the tent wall. Winning the fight meant tearing through and escaping.
Rip.
The tent wall tore before he could. Beyond the torn tent wall,
“You’re a bit late.”
A voice accompanied by glowing green eyes.
It was the elf company commander, the mastermind behind the assassination. Instinctively, Enkrid attempted a thrust. Although it was a dagger in his hand, it was a technique he had repeated countless times, ingrained in his body. Pivoting on his left foot, he twisted his body and thrust at the opponent in one swift motion. His right arm extended like a spear.
The elf company commander, with glowing eyes, stepped inside and swung her right hand from inside to outside.
Thunk, swoosh.
With that gesture, the trajectory of the thrust was diverted. At the same time, the commander kicked Enkrid’s supporting leg.
The world spun, and Enkrid soon rolled to the ground.
Then, the elf company commander displayed an incomprehensible move.
Tinkle.
Enkrid turned away, grabbing his cloak and flinging it in front of him.
Thud, thud, thud, something embedded into the cloak.
Poisoned darts.
“Are you alright?”
In a dazed state, he saw Crang crouched outside the tent.
“Was there a guard?”
The assassin’s voice was evidently shaken.
“Assassination makes me nauseous.”
The elf company commander said, letting the cloak fall. Enkrid’s mind raced to understand the situation.
‘There wasn’t an assassin?’
Was he on the defense? So, the one he saw when dying was not the one who killed him but someone who arrived late?
“You don’t seem hurt?”
“I’m just startled.”
Enkrid replied to Crang’s question and turned his body.
The assassin, upon seeing the elf company commander, seemed to have decided to escape, and his center of gravity shifted backward. The commander didn’t seem to intend to stop him.
Soon, the assassin backed away, then bolted out of the tent entrance and fled. Even while running, his footsteps were almost silent.
“Well then.”
Crang chuckled awkwardly and stepped into the tent. The commander approached the tent entrance, grabbed the shoulder of the seemingly unconscious freckled soldier, and dragged him inside.
After a glance at Vengeance, the commander turned around. Her green eyes met Enkrid’s.
A brief silence.
After a moment, the commander tilted her head and spoke.
“You’re alive?”
That question carried a note of surprise.
Chapter 19: Fire
He endured today. The cycle of training and practice. Enkrid did just that. And for the first time in his repeated today, he had reached this point.
‘Will I die?’
That was his first thought in response to the company commander’s reaction. Enkrid quickly corrected himself.
‘If she intended to kill me, she would have done it earlier.’
When did Crang slip away? He hadn’t even noticed his presence.
‘Tsk.’
Despite this situation,
‘I’m still lacking.’
Enkrid felt the inadequacy of his trained hearing. It was in his nature. As a result, he missed the timing to respond. The newly appointed company commander, an elf woman, was staring at him intently.
Didn’t she ask, “You’re alive?”
What should he say?
Enkrid opened his mouth.
“...Should I have died?”
“Hm, no.”
The company commander replied, moving only her lips. She stared at Enkrid for a long time before turning away. Then she picked up the fallen poisoned darts, checked Vengeance and the guard she had brought along, rolling their eyes back to check their condition.
‘Is she checking to see if the soldiers are dead?’
Then she brought the poisoned dart to her lips and lightly touched it with her tongue.
‘Is she knowledgeable in herbal medicine too?’
He had seen mercenaries do such things occasionally. Elves were often close to nature, so it wasn’t surprising they were knowledgeable about poisons and medicines.
Enkrid just sat and watched. He wasn’t in the mood to get up. Of course, if someone aimed for his neck right now, he would roll or dodge, but it was still exhausting.
Although not as draining as the first repeated day, it was still tiring. If the first repetition was physically exhausting, this time it felt like he had used up all his mental energy. He had evaded numerous repeated attacks by sound alone. In the process, he hadn’t sustained a single scratch.
It wasn’t mere coincidence. How many times had he been attacked?
Sometimes without any signs, but he had narrowly dodged the first attack several times. Repeated patterns became learned behavior. Even assassins had patterns in their actions. Enkrid instinctively learned them.
‘Having experienced it once helps.’
Would the second time be easier?
No.
It was never easy.
If someone who had seen Enkrid’s repeated today had been there with him, they would never say such a thing.
But no one could. In the isolated today, he was always alone.
Enkrid pressed his temples with his fingers. His excitement hadn’t subsided, and his head throbbed. In time, it would turn into a headache. He instinctively sensed this.
Sss.
Someone was near, the presence of something close to his neck made Enkrid reflexively twist his body and extend his palm. There he saw Crang pretending to strike Enkrid’s neck with the edge of his hand.
“Do you really have eyes on the back of your head?”
Crang said, seemingly amazed.
“It’s not the time for jokes.”
What’s with this irresponsible guy?
Crang chuckled and spoke casually.
“Ah, sorry.”
Was it really an assassin targeting this guy?
‘Then why didn’t they just kill him, instead of coming after me first?’
Was it just bad luck? Could it be as simple as bad luck?
No way. The assassin must have targeted Crang.
It didn’t make sense for an assassin to come after Vengeance and him.
‘If it were Vengeance and me, it would be easier to frame us and kill us.’
Sending an assassin to handle two powerless soldiers? There’s no need.
Why send an assassin? To eliminate quietly and discreetly. Take care of it without causing a commotion.
What to do with the corpses after killing them? Burn the tent.
Who would care about the wounds on a body burned to death? Even if not that, there were many ways to dispose of bodies. Wipe the blood and traces, and dump them in a secluded place. People would think it was a desertion, not kidnapping and murder. Especially since this was an outlying medical tent. It was an improvised medical tent for soldiers, not officers. No one paid much attention to it.
Of course, this wasn’t a place one could just come to if they wanted to.
“They probably targeted me.”
It was when the company commander roughly surveyed the inside and peeked outside the tent. Crang, crouched next to him, spoke abruptly.
“Hm, why?”
“You don’t seem very surprised.”
“I am surprised, plenty.”
“You’re good at keeping a straight face.”
Is now the time to focus on that?
Enkrid was about to snap but held back. He knew from experience. Crang was easygoing.
‘Of course, he knows when to be serious.’
It was a repeated today, so Crang wouldn’t remember, but Enkrid had a vivid image of Crang speaking as if he was absorbing everything around him.
“You don’t intend to reveal who you are, do you?”
The company commander, who had approached silently, spoke. Crang nodded slightly and spoke again.
“Anyway, I’m sorry.”
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Crang stood up and looked around, making eye contact with the company commander.
“I’m not in a position to order anyone, so I’m asking for a favor.”
Crang addressed not only Vengeance but also the company commander casually. Unless he was a high-ranking noble, this was impossible. Otherwise, he’d be risking death by the sword. He wasn’t just speaking casually.
He took a step.
Just one step forward.
It was like that time. When he asked who he was, it was a similar atmosphere. Crang quietly accepted the gaze.
Two spectators, one actor.
But the actor was like a vortex. An entity that absorbed and swallowed everything around it.
“Can I ask for a favor? Consider it a debt I will repay.”
“Please.”
The company commander answered humbly. Crang spoke with a gentle smile.
“I hope no one dies today.”
Small but firm, calm but storm-like.
If a voice had magic, it would be like this.
It made one want to fulfill his request. The tone and manner induced that thought.
How could one make someone feel this way?
Enkrid felt a strange sense of déjà vu. It was because he had experienced it once. The vortex that absorbed everything around it soon subsided. Crang spoke and extended his hand to Enkrid.
“Are your legs weak?”
“No, it’s not that bad.”
Enkrid took his hand with a complicated feeling.
“...Is this the reason you changed your mind?”
Seeing them, the company commander asked.
“Let’s say it is.”
Crang replied. Enkrid couldn’t understand their conversation at all, nor did he want to ask.
‘Not like they would tell me.’
The company commander let out a small sigh and spoke to Enkrid.
“Can you keep today’s events a secret?”
“Yes, of course.”
There was no other answer to give when she asked, seemingly ready to put a hole in his neck if he refused. He had seen the new company commander’s skill earlier.
Just one move, but,
‘Could she really deflect it like that?’
One move to push away with the back of her hand.
With one gesture, Enkrid had lost his balance and fallen. He wanted to see that again.
If not, he would just die and repeat the day again.
If he refused to keep quiet?
Would she kill him?
No. That wouldn’t work.
There were many ways to make him silent without killing him. It was useless to resist. He had no desire to commit suicide either.
“I ask you.”
More than anything, Crang spoke like this. Though only for a few days, just a few conversations, Enkrid felt a strong bond with Crang. Their relationship was peculiarly intimate despite the short time.
“Keeping secrets is my specialty.”
It wasn’t an empty statement. How many secrets did he know within the squad? Some were important, some were not. He had never spoken of any of them.
“Then, we just need to resolve this situation.”
The company commander said, looking at the torn tent and the two fallen soldiers.
“That wish of no more deaths includes those two.”
Crang said, and the company commander nodded nonchalantly. No one knew what had happened here.
But if they found out?
Judging by the look, revealing Crang’s identity seemed difficult. The company commander was deep in thought.
“If the guard wakes up, will he realize he was attacked?”
Enkrid asked, brushing dirt off his bottom.
“I guess not. Even if he did, he wouldn’t have seen anything.”
The company commander spoke with half confidence. Enkrid thought so too.
How many times had he been attacked without knowing anything? That freckled guard would have passed out without knowing anything.
So,
“Could you carry one outside?”
Enkrid’s words made the company commander look at him.
“There’s a simple and convenient solution. I might take some flak for it, but you can cover for me, right?”
He explained the plan. Crang laughed, and the company commander nodded without a smile.
Whoosh!
“Uh?”
The guard, dozing off in front of the tent, felt a sudden sting on his cheek and opened his eyes. Half asleep, he turned and froze for a moment.
‘Fire?’
It was a fire. Flames were climbing up the front of the tent.
Thud.
The sound of the spear he was holding dropping to the ground woke him up completely.
“F-Fire! Fire! Fire!”
The guard who dropped his spear shouted. His tongue was tied in surprise.
“Fire! Fire! Fire!”
Instead of shouting ‘Fire!’ out loud, he kept repeating just ‘fire’ but his urgent cries quickly alerted everyone nearby.
“Fire!”
A nearby patrol guard shouted, making the situation clear.
“The medical tent is on fire!”
The quick-witted patrol guard’s voice echoed loudly.
“Get water!”
Only then did the other soldiers start to poke their heads out and assess the situation.
“Damn it, is anyone inside?”
“Were there people in there?”
“Yes, those damn soldiers!”
The flames quickly spread from the front of the tent to the entire tent. It was chaos in the middle of the night. Black soot and smoke rose into the sky. Even the bravest soldiers couldn’t enter in such a situation.
“Get water!”
The supply company commander yelled. Those who were quick on their feet brought water in buckets.
Splash!
They poured water over the flames. For a moment, smoke rose.
“Line up and pass the buckets!”
The supply company commander shouted. His experience in carrying supplies paid off. Passing buckets was a method of handing objects along a line. The soldiers lined up and started passing the water buckets forward.
Splash!
One idiot dropped a bucket on the ground.
“Are you joking? Pick it up quickly!”
“Understood!”
The commotion continued. The flames reflected on the soldiers’ faces. The supply company commander stomped his feet. The important thing wasn’t the tent burning. If it spread to the next tent, it would be an unmanageable disaster. The problem of the fire spreading was bigger than a few soldiers inside dying. As the bucket passing calmed the flames bit by bit, the supply company commander let out a sigh of relief.
‘But why the sudden fire?’
Was it the season for fires?
The weather wasn’t dry enough for that. Fortunately, the fire didn’t spread. The flames seemed to have been waiting, as they only burned the one tent.
“There’s someone here!”
In the midst of this, a soldier with good night vision shouted.
“Bring them over, it’s fortunate they’re alive.”
The supply company commander spoke words he didn’t mean. More fortunate than their survival was the fact that the fire hadn’t spread.
Enkrid laid the freckled soldier next to Vengeance, whom the company commander had moved outside.
“Here!”
He shouted, and people gathered.
“Are you okay?”
“A sudden fire?”
“What happened?”
Enkrid, his face covered in soot, coughed. He looked like someone who had just escaped the burning tent.
“I... cough, cough, don’t know.”
Enkrid spoke between coughs. The midnight fire ended up being considered an accident.
Hoo-woo.
In the distance, the cry of an owl or something similar was heard. Probably from the direction of the forest. The elf company commander listened to the sound, matching the map in her head and her current location, and walked. Not far from the base, it was a pebbled stream.
Upon reaching her destination, the company commander spoke.
“If it weren’t for that squad leader, it would have been dangerous.”
Just by looking around the tent, she grasped the assassin’s intention.
‘Eliminate the one at the entrance and then the target.’
The one at the entrance was Enkrid. Thanks to him, he survived. Had he held out even a little less, he would have died. Both he and the guard would have died.
“Really.”
Crang spoke and took a deep breath in and out. The company commander turned to look at him.
“Then.”
A simple farewell. The unique light steps of the elves made no sound at all. She was currently the company commander of the 4th Battalion, 4th Company of the Cyprus Brigade. It was time to return to the base. The figure of the elf fading into the darkness soon disappeared from sight. Crang thought of Enkrid’s dream.
‘A knight.’
“Seeing you, I think I know how I should live too.”
Crang had responded this way after hearing Enkrid’s dream. It wasn’t an empty statement. Though he might deceive others, he had never said empty words to someone who approached him sincerely.
Crang had a secret about his birth. But he didn’t like his birth or his secret. So far, he had avoided facing it.
‘I’ll face it too.’
He recognized Enkrid’s skills at a glance. Such a person dreamed of becoming a knight. Out of ten passersby, five would say it was an unattainable dream. The remaining five would be busy laughing.
Still, he dreamed. He didn't give up. Though it had only been a few days, seeing him repeatedly clenching and unclenching his fists, Crang sensed he wouldn’t change.
Such people don’t change easily.
“You were an interesting friend.”
A strange intimacy remained. The clouds above Crang’s head parted. The moonlight began to peek through.
He walked.
A slightly different life awaited him ahead.
Chapter 20: Squad Leader Enkrid
There was a torch stand between the tents and the supply tent had oil. For several days, he had been repeating today, training his hearing. He could find everything around him with his eyes closed.
“Just a moment.”
It was really simple. Enkrid used sounds to locate the patrol guards and stealthily got oil from the supply tent. Then, he poured the oil roughly over the tent.
The rest was even easier. He just had to kick the torch stand over. Since no one was watching, he crawled in the shadows and pulled the torch stand, toppling it over.
The flame at the end of the torch stand met the oil with a whoosh, greeting it warmly.
“You’ve got some skills.”
The company commander said blandly.
Was that a compliment?
Enkrid thought so as he set fire to the tent. Of course, the fire started where he had poured the oil first. Enkrid made sure to get some soot on his face and inhale a bit of smoke. Reacting genuinely was much easier than faking it.
“Cough!”
Coughing, Enkrid carried the freckled soldier and exited through the tear in the tent where the company commander had entered. He collapsed in front of the medical tent.
That was enough.
“Fire!”
He had timed the fire to when the patrol guard would be coming.
No, he had to.
The night watch of the neighboring tent was an expert at sleeping while standing. He didn’t wake up at all. Enkrid thought the assassin had shot a poison dart at him too.
It didn’t require much preparation to get here. He had simply stolen oil from the supply tent and toppled the torch stand. However, Crang and the company commander, who watched, seemed quite impressed.
“Honestly, you’d make a great leader for a band of thieves.”
Crang’s words just before leaving lingered in his mind. Was that supposed to be a compliment?
Running his hand through his hair, his fingers caught on the tangled strands.
‘I should get a haircut.’
He lay down without even thinking about wiping the soot off his face. It wasn’t a big fire. It wouldn’t be a major incident. No one had died. He had already thought up an excuse about the night watch.
‘Ask me tomorrow. Tomorrow.’
Without exaggeration, he really wanted to just lie down and sleep like this. It had been a long night. A really long today. His headache had surpassed throbbing and left his head feeling numb. He didn’t want to think about anything.
“Survivors?”
“Over there. I think he passed out now.”
He knew they were talking about him, but he ignored it and closed his eyes. Fatigue washed over him.
Though he wasn’t the freckled night watch, Enkrid felt a one-sided closeness to him.
‘You don’t know this, but.’
Enkrid had talked to him. He knew where he was from. He knew about the girlfriend he left back home and why he joined the military. Today was something he had but not the other guy. That closeness came from that.
Besides, the fire and the attack weren’t his fault. So, he came up with a reasonable excuse.
He said the night watch had shouted as soon as the fire broke out and tried to rescue those inside, but inhaled smoke and fainted.
He was a fresh recruit who had just finished training. And there was no fire training during the drills. Everyone accepted the reason.
“Did I really do that?”
Though he asked bewilderedly, not remembering a thing.
“Must have lost your memory.”
The supply company commander just let it pass. Enkrid had wondered if anyone would suspect him, but no one did. It was too perfect a cover.
He thought someone might find it suspicious, but thankfully, no one did. The supply company commander was just relieved the supply tent hadn’t caught fire. That had been part of his plan, so the situation went as he intended.
A new bright morning.
Today didn’t repeat.
Enkrid woke up still feeling a headache but he was satisfied. After all, he had survived another ‘today.’
“You saved me?”
With his face and body washed and his soot-smelling clothes changed, holding a dagger to roughly trim his hair, Enkrid headed out. Vengeance sat on a supply box and asked.
“I couldn’t just watch you burn to death in front of me.”
Vengeance muttered at Enkrid’s words. After mumbling something, he asked.
“...Why?”
Enkrid wondered if such a thing needed a reason. With his head still pounding, he didn’t want to talk much.
“Because you’re my comrade.”
So, he spoke without much thought. Vengeance’s expression hardened at that.
“Tsk.”
Seeing his hardened face, Enkrid spoke.
“The flower of the battlefield is...”
“...The infantry.”
It was the infantry company’s greeting. With that, Enkrid turned around. He had just received orders to return.
“I’ve only been a jerk.”
Vengeance’s grumbling voice faintly reached his ears.
Sounds he wouldn’t normally hear were now audible.
‘Hearing training.’
Enkrid reflected on the abilities he had gained.
He also recalled how the elf company commander deflected his sword last night. He thought about dodging the assassin’s attacks too.
A natural question arose.
‘Am I still in the same place?’
It wasn’t serious. Just curiosity. How different were yesterday’s Enkrid and today’s Enkrid? Suddenly, he wanted to face Rem in a match.
‘First,’
Returning to the main camp and resting was a priority. His head still throbbed.
“The weather is nice.”
Without walking far, Enkrid noticed a long shadow stretching to his right. Looking up, he saw a clear blue canvas in the sky. Cumulus clouds were scattered across, with a refreshing breeze and warm sunlight. It was a very clear day.
Just walking made him feel his headache was easing.
Kraiss outwardly appeared calm, but internally he sighed deeply. Enkrid had been gone for a week.
‘How did we manage back then?’
In the face of the current situation, Kraiss mentally retreated. He recalled the days without Enkrid.
“So, I’m the squad leader here. So, you have to listen to me. So, gather in front of the tent now.”
The squad leader kept repeating ‘so.’ He had shown a coercive attitude. And he had died screaming on the first battlefield.
“Follow me!”
He seemed to have heard some strange rumor. Though the Troublemaker Squad was small in number, their skills were top-notch.
Did he really think they would quietly follow him?
He charged alone and got his head impaled by a spear. When his helmet flew back, Rem had kicked it away.
‘The next squad leader.’
“I heard you guys are good fighters. Wanna test your skills? Anyone wanna go against me?”
He was a noble’s son. Rumor had it he had committed some crime and was conscripted. Details unknown, he said he’d stay here for a few months before returning. The noble was full of confidence but lacked experience.
“Can we spar with the squad leader?”
Rem scratched his head and asked.
“Um, not you. Yeah, you. The one with the reddish-brown hair.”
He picked Jaxon as his opponent. Rem looked like a thug, so anyone could see he was a fighter. And calling out Kraiss was too much. So, he picked the relatively harmless-looking Jaxon.
Naturally, it was a big mistake.
“Me?”
“Yes, come on. Let’s spar. Haha, I’ve never lost before.”
“What if someone gets hurt during the spar?”
“Are you scared of that? Let’s just keep it off the record!”
The arrogant and cocky noble squad leader...
“Ahhh!”
Got his arm broken.
“I expected him to dodge.”
Though usually amicable, Jaxon could turn quite vicious after being provoked by Rem and the other squad members watching the match.
“You should have stepped forward with your left foot there.”
“Funny, just trip him and he’ll fall.”
“You’re losing your grip on the sword. Hold it tighter. Underestimating your opponent will get you hurt.”
“Tsk, this guy can’t even take down a prick properly. I’d have finished by now. Ah, boring.”
Those comments turned Jaxon fierce.
The company commander got furious over the broken arm.
“Are you assaulting a superior?”
“You are the one who said it’s off the record and insisted on the fight.”
“Right, right. A man’s word is his bond.”
“If a man changes his words, he loses his manhood.”
With each squad member chiming in, the company commander couldn’t say much. Facts were facts. The noble squad leader soon withdrew. At his family estate, he might have had plenty of mercenaries to lose to him for money, but this was a battlefield.
The company commander hadn’t intended to bring the noble to the battlefield anyway. She had just given him a nominal position.
‘The next squad leader was also...’
The same.
A hot-tempered squad leader had a quiet chat with Rem outside and applied for a transfer, calming down.
Others left for similar reasons. Those who stayed just tolerated each other.
“Phew.”
Kraiss turned his head at the sigh behind him.
“Finally.”
He muttered in relief, recognizing the face.
“What’s this?”
It was Enkrid. He pressed his temples with his index finger as he approached. Enkrid looked at the two facing each other in front of the Fourth-Fourth squad tent. It was the reality Kraiss had avoided.
“I said I’m the acting squad leader without a squad leader, so follow orders. Ragna Squad member?”
“Address me with ‘sir’ added to my last name, you barbarian.”
“Huh, has this picky eater dressed up in noble’s attire?”
“It’s offensive for a beast to call my name.”
“Oh, really? Maybe you need a rough lesson from this beast?”
Rem’s hand bulged with veins, ready to split Ragna’s head.
The squad member called Ragna faced him indifferently.
He stood calmly with his hands down.
That was Ragna’s ready stance.
Jaxon watched indifferently.
One remaining squad member prayed quietly, trying to intervene.
“Brother, fighting and violence are wrong.”
“Stay out, you religious nut.”
“Step back. There’s no mercy in swords.”
Rem and Ragna replied simultaneously.
‘The squad is a mess.’
Just a week and they were like this.
The headache that had disappeared while walking returned.
“Kraiss, any spare medicine?”
Jaxon spoke indifferently, fight or not. He greeted Enkrid with a nod and asked Kraiss.
“Not right now. Squad leader, you’re back. I was going to find you. There’s been some trouble.”
Kraiss shook his head at Jaxon and spoke to Enkrid.
“Hold on.”
First, he had to stop those two.
Left alone, there would be bloodshed.
It was the same the day he arrived.
Back then, it wasn’t Ragna but the praying squad member.
“Many things can’t be solved with fighting and violence.”
The one speaking like that wasn’t normal either.
“Hey!”
Enkrid ignored his throbbing headache and stepped between them.
The way to stop their fights was simple.
Words wouldn’t work.
You had to physically intervene.
Enkrid walked between them.
“...Really, they say ignorance is bliss, don’t they?”
Rem muttered. The veins in his hands twitched and then stopped.
“I can’t just cut him. The squad leader, um, forget it.”
Rem and Ragna stepped back. They didn’t forget to exchange pleasantries.
“Don’t die on the battlefield, I want to kill you myself.”
Ragna said.
“Huh? What? Want to die tomorrow? Can’t wait to taste my axe?”
Rem retorted.
“Enough.”
Enkrid shook his head in the middle. Why did they hate each other so much?
He didn’t know. They had been like this from the start. They were still glaring at each other.
Just arrived, and it was already a fight.
“Anyway, all sorts of things happened while you were gone.”
Kraiss spoke again from behind.
“Did they?”
It was obvious.
When in the medical tent, Ragna said the tent was a mess, and he was right. It was somewhat expected. It was fine. After experiencing so many hardships, their mess didn’t bother him.
They missed meal duty and ate individually. They fought with the neighboring squad and punched one guy’s jaw and ignored the squad leader’s summons.
‘Isn’t it too much of a mess without me?’
He thought, but it was fine. Kraiss kept babbling. Enkrid realized the chaos wasn’t limited to the Troublemaker Squad.
“A curse?”
Enkrid forgot his headache and asked.
“Yes, they say the whole camp is cursed.”
What nonsense is this?
It was so absurd it made him forget his headache.
Chapter 21: Sparring and Review
Boom.
Suddenly, lightning struck out of the blue, and rain started to pour.
"Damn, this ruins the mood."
"Hmm."
Rem and Ragna, whose tempers had flared, averted their gazes from each other. The fight was over. The two sought shelter from the rain and entered the tent. Despite the earlier clear skies, the weather had turned chaotic.
It was the end of autumn. It was not the season for sudden showers. Such a sudden rain with clear skies was rare.
"Sudden rain."
Kraiss remarked as he watched the lightning and rain. Enkrid also looked up at the sky, reflecting on the events that had occurred while he was away. As expected, the talk of a curse was nonsense.
"They'll probably say this rain is a curse too."
"Maybe. Anyway, in the past three days, Bon fell and broke his nose, Jack broke his arm, and Rot was bitten by a snake."
All three were from the recon team.
Bon was agile enough to do somersaults, so breaking only his nose was fortunate given he wore armor. Jack was a braggart who overestimated his spear skills. He broke his arm during a spar, and one could bet the opponent had intended to break it. Lastly, Rot was careless for a recon member.
It wasn’t the season for many snakes, but this plain was particularly infested. So, all three incidents were understandable.
"Besides those three, someone also touched a hot pot."
Big eyes spoke excitedly. Would he speak like this if he genuinely believed in the curse? It was just something to talk about.
"Also, there was news that the medical tent caught fire. Oh, you were there, right, squad leader? Did you hear anything?"
Was the tent fire also considered a curse?
"Yeah, it burned well."
Kraiss stopped entering the tent and turned his head sharply.
"Did you see it yourself? Did the fire suddenly flare up? They said there might have been a spy?"
Yes and No.
‘I did it.’
Enkrid had started the fire. And as for a spy, there had been an ambush, but whether the attacker was an enemy soldier was doubtful. He still didn’t know Crang’s true identity, but he seemed to be at least a noble’s illegitimate son.
So, wasn’t the attacker probably from their own side?
Talking about curses, what could one say?
The command would soon crack down on this talk. No commander liked such rumors spreading within their unit.
"Hey, did you see anything?"
Big eyes pressed him. Enkrid looked into those large eyes and thought.
Kraiss was too loose-lipped to tell everything. Even if he weren’t, there was no reason to share it. He had decided to keep it quiet, so he would.
"The tent I was in caught fire."
"Huh?"
"Didn’t you know?"
"Not at all. So, it wasn’t an enemy attack? The fire started suddenly?"
"The night watch was dozing, and the wind knocked over the torch stand. There happened to be an oil drum nearby. The tent caught fire from the fallen torch."
Enkrid clenched and unclenched his fist, mimicking the spreading flames with his hand.
"Nothing much."
"Aren’t you worried you almost died?"
"I’m alive and well here."
Was that concern or what?
"If you weren’t alive and well, wouldn’t you be a ghost?"
Rem interrupted from behind, laughing. Was this bastard joking?
"The Lord says, let the spirits rest in peace."
The religious squad member performed an exorcism with his words. Enkrid thought that if he were indeed a ghost, it would be unpleasant to hear.
"Only my hair got singed."
His bangs had been slightly burnt, so he cut them. The roughly cut hair showed signs of poor trimming.
"You’ve got black hair, so it’s not noticeable when it burns."
Rem laughed continuously.
"Then is your hair ashes?"
Rem’s hair was gray.
"Ah, how did you know? My hair is ashes."
Did this guy really find this funny?
Though it had been a sudden shower, the rain quickly stopped. The chatter didn’t last long. Kraiss left, saying he had business to attend to as soon as the rain stopped. Enkrid lay down, falling asleep to the sound of raindrops pattering at the edge of the tent.
It was a sweet nap. When he woke up, his headache was gone. The fatigue was also gone. Enkrid got up and twisted his waist side to side. There was no pain in his side.
Good. He felt refreshed.
The tent was empty. Listening closely, he heard people passing by outside the tent and the grumbling voice of a soldier in the neighboring tent.
"What's with this on-and-off rain?"
Enkrid pushed the tent flap aside and stepped outside. Squad members were scattered in front of the tent, enjoying their personal maintenance time. It was no surprise that Jaxon and Kraiss were nowhere to be seen. The others were present. Among them, Enkrid approached Rem, who was scribbling on the wet ground.
"You look like you have nothing to do."
"Do I? That’s right. I was just thinking about cracking someone’s skull out of boredom."
Starting fights with the squad was one of Rem’s specialties. When the picked fight escalated, beating the opponent up was his hobby. Though it had lessened since Enkrid arrived, he hadn’t completely abandoned the hobby.
"Then spar with me."
"Spar?"
"Yes, spar."
Rem nodded without hesitation. This had happened countless times. Enkrid’s request for a spar was routine.
"Alright."
The two headed to the empty lot behind the tent. Thanks to the crazy weather, there was no one around. Even if there were, they wouldn’t care. Enkrid and Rem faced each other with ten paces between them.
Rem grinned, twirling his wrist. The newly sharpened axe blade reflected the sunlight with every movement.
Though it had rained, the sky was now clear. The air was humid, and the smell of earth filled the air. The ground was soft but not muddy, slightly damp but not sinking. The clouds covered the sun enough that it wasn’t blinding.
"A perfect day for a fight."
"Yeah?"
Enkrid responded and awakened the Heart of the Beast. He strived not to waste time, repeating the same day over and over. This included physical training and hearing exercises. It also involved using his head.
‘The Vallen Style Mercenary Sword doesn’t work.’
Having sparred countless times with Rem while learning the thrust, he knew. The Vallen Style Mercenary Swordsmanship was useless against Rem.
So, what to do?
Considering his weapon, the opponent’s pressure, and his past experiences.
What kind of attack would be effective?
How to make an effective hit. It was time to test the answers to these repeated questions.
Sss.
Rem stepped forward. His steps were confident, showing no hesitation. Enkrid thought so.
"Do I have to go first?"
Instead of answering, Enkrid matched his breathing to the opponent’s.
Inhale and exhale. Rem’s breathing was long and slow. In the middle of that long exhale, Enkrid closed the gap in an instant. He pushed off his back foot and moved forward closing the distance.
Whoosh!
He swung his sword horizontally. Rem bent backward, almost lying down to dodge. It was a trick he could pull off only by accurately predicting the range of the slash. Even in a half-lying position, Rem’s eyes never left Enkrid. Seeing this, Enkrid reflexively pulled his sword back to guard himself.
Whoosh.
Thud!
The axe had flown and struck the sword blade. The impact wasn’t significant. No matter how strong he was, it was a swing from a lying position.
In that position...
Whoosh, whoosh!
The axe flew repeatedly.
Thud! Thud! Clang!
Enkrid held the sword with both hands, blocking continuously. He tried to pause and adjust his stance to attack, but Rem didn’t stop. Enkrid felt like he was standing under a guillotine. The axe storm ended as Rem fully straightened up. A brief gap appeared, but Enkrid didn’t retreat. He didn’t adjust his stance.
Rem straightened his back and pulled his arm back. Seeing this, Enkrid, instead of retreating and catching his breath,
Snap!
Step forward and thrust, a move he had repeated countless times. With the blade extended from the blocking stance, he aimed to pierce.
Everything happened in an instant.
As he thrust toward Rem’s waist, Enkrid’s vision overlapped with the blue sky and Rem’s face.
‘Huh?’
Enkrid saw Rem’s face upside down.
Whoosh.
As he thrust, Rem kicked Enkrid’s ankle. A split-second decision. Thanks to that, the sword tip missed its mark. Rem didn’t swing the axe but dropped it, grabbed Enkrid’s collar, and threw him sideways.
"Ugh!"
Rolling sideways, Enkrid quickly understood how he had been defeated. It was a feint. He had timed the backward movement of the axe.
Rem used that against him.
"Hoo."
Lying sprawled, Enkrid shook his head. Such immense strength. Enkrid thought he wasn’t easily outmatched in strength, but Rem could fling a person with one hand. Even without armor, he was relatively light, but it was still remarkable strength. Raising his head, he saw Rem’s face.
It was a peculiar expression. Rem usually laughed throughout a spar.
But not now.
His lips were tight, his expression composed. He wasn’t smiling.
"Tsk, did you eat something good behind my back?"
Rem asked seriously. Thinking back, such a reaction was natural. He wouldn’t remember helping with thrust training. After all, he had only assigned him to meal duty to escape that first ‘today.’
"I thought this before, but your skills have improved significantly. Especially that thrust. It was good. Not bad at all."
"Really?"
"Yes. I don’t give empty compliments."
"Hard to believe."
Enkrid scoffed, knowing he was always full of nonsense.
"It’s true."
"Alright. Let’s review then."
"...The squad leader is really consistent. Don’t you ever change?"
Reviewing after a spar. This was also routine. No matter how minor, Enkrid clung to his sparring partner. To learn and master even the smallest things. Often, the opponent had nothing to say. Only when skills improved could they offer advice. That had been the case so far. So, Rem used to say, ‘Grow some guts,’ after sparring.
It seemed meaningless, but it wasn’t. Rem knew the limits of the untalented. To survive, he taught what was necessary. He had also taught the Heart of the Beast for the same reason.
But now?
Much had changed.
The fact that Rem had much to say after this spar proved it.
"First, you made it too obvious you were waiting for my axe swing. Even if I don’t fall for it easily, you should at least try to deceive me, right?"
Rem began. Enkrid nodded. As always, he listened intently. Rem chuckled at the sight.
He always started by addressing the key points before moving on to minor details. That was Rem’s way. Enkrid listened to every word carefully.
There were no battles for three days, during which Enkrid sparred with Rem three more times.
"You should train your lower body. Your balance is off."
Though usually full of nonsense, Rem had a knack for pinpointing the crux. Enkrid pondered and mulled over his words. He then focused on training again. He did so even during personal maintenance time.
Everyone spent personal time differently. Some wrote letters. Others focused on rest. Enkrid poured everything into practice and training except eating and sleeping. Anyone would call it extreme.
But to him, it was peaceful.
He felt immense satisfaction in improving day by day. Thanks to this, he didn’t mind the increasing pain from physical training.
"What a relentless guy. Training right after returning from the medical tent."
"He was quiet lately, but now he’s on fire again."
"If I trained like that, I’d at least be at the edge of knighthood."
"Huh? Why are you talking crap?"
He focused on training and listening. Concentrating on hearing while his muscles screamed made the pain fade. Enkrid heard the idle talk of two soldiers from a nearby tent. They were from the same platoon but felt distant, the 3rd squad. He then extended his hearing further.
He tried to guess the actions by the sound of rustling clothes behind him. He attempted to identify who was approaching by their footsteps. He was wrong five out of ten times, but he could recognize familiar steps. Light and quick, the sound of feet on the ground was lively.
‘Big eyes.’
He was right.
"Training again? It’s creepy. Creepy."
Kraiss approached and said. Enkrid ignored him.
Repeating squats, his legs started trembling. Sweat dripped down his scalp, gathering at his eyebrows. The sky that had been fluctuating was now clear, with a dry breeze returning to its normal state. Sweating profusely on such a day didn’t seem normal. Especially here on the battlefield.
Training in a place where a fight could break out at any moment. Yet, everyone accepted it. Enkrid had been like this for more than a day or two. It was their routine.
"Isn’t that hard? How do you do it every day?"
Kraiss said, sitting and chewing on a piece of flat jerky. A drop of sweat rolled from his forehead, touched his nose, and fell to the ground. Heavy pain surged from his thighs. His muscles trembled and nausea rose. He was at his limit.
Enkrid sat down, drenched in sweat. Closing his eyes, he felt the cool breeze caress his wet forehead and ears. Training for today was complete. Thinking so, he enjoyed the breeze.
He heard the sound of strong footsteps. The footsteps stopped behind Enkrid.
"Still working hard, I see."
He tilted his head back to see who it was. The figure cast a long shadow over Enkrid’s face. Though the face was obscured by backlight, he saw a man with a bushy beard.
"Can we talk?"
It was the 4th platoon leader.
Chapter 22: Temporary Reassignment
The 4th platoon leader made a trivial comment.
Enkrid half-listened, recognizing that the man had something to say.
“If you have something to say, just say it.”
He was enjoying the cool breeze after being drenched in sweat. It was the perfect moment of relaxation and unwinding. He wanted the platoon leader to get on with it and leave.
"...I'd like you to transfer to the recon team and carry out a mission."
The 4th platoon leader crossed his arms, displaying a defensive rather than commanding posture.
Enkrid thought it over. The recon team.
It wasn’t a common reassignment. Moreover, he was aware of his ambiguous position. The only reason he could remain a squad leader was because this was the Fourth-Fourth Squad.
And they wanted to take him out for reconnaissance?
“Is it okay to take our squad leader?”
Rem suddenly poked his head in from behind, resting his chin on Enkrid’s shoulder. Since they weren’t much different in height, it was a comfortable position.
“Are you serious?”
Half-smiling, he seemed to be protesting the idea.
“It’s an order, Rem.”
The 4th platoon leader glared, but it was all show. Enkrid saw through it instantly. Rem was a troublemaker, a maniac who would swing his axe if things didn’t go his way. Everyone including the 4th platoon leader, Enkrid, and Rem knew that waving authority at such a maniac was meaningless.
“Rem.”
Enkrid called his name, nudging him back before he could say anything more.
“Fine, do as you please.”
Rem grumbled as he stepped back.
“I can go instead.”
Ragna, who had been watching silently, spoke up nonchalantly.
“...Was being lost your dream?”
Rem snickered. Ragna nearly exploded in anger but held it in. It wasn’t a lie. Ragna had no talent for finding his way. Even with a map and directions, he would end up somewhere else. He didn’t work well with others and had been transferred here for fighting however he pleased. He wasn’t fit to be a scout.
“Anyone but you.”
The 4th platoon leader had no choice but to shake his head at Ragna. Enkrid sensed this situation wasn’t a good sign.
‘Considering everything, I am the best fit.’
His ambiguous position only held meaning within the 444 Squad. He had caused quite a stir just by being absent for a week.
And now, they were specifically calling for him?
It suggested there was no one else available. The talk of curses had quieted down, but the effects lingered. Bon, Jack, and Rot were all part of the recon team. They were short-handed.
“Sigh, it’s a headache. One platoon leader has food poisoning and can’t even move.”
It was almost believable as a curse. All this trouble specifically hit the recon platoon. The platoon leader looked exhausted. He didn’t seem eager to call for Enkrid either.
‘This feels off.’
As Enkrid stared, the platoon leader sighed heavily.
“Don’t look at me like that. I’ll explain everything.”
“Yes?”
“Don’t look at me like that.”
‘What did I do?’
He had just been staring, but the 4th platoon leader was overreacting with a deep sigh.
“What’s with the eye language? Sometimes, you have to think about how the person on the receiving end feels. Especially if it’s a superior.”
Rem laughed. Reacting to that joke would lead nowhere. Enkrid looked back at the platoon leader.
“To temporarily increase the number of recon members, we promoted a squad leader to platoon leader. But we’re still short-staffed. So, we were ordered to recruit capable individuals from each unit. And you were suggested from above. So here we are.”
“From above?”
“The new company commander. You’re not in trouble, are you?”
To silence him by sending him to the recon team where he might die unnoticed? No, there was no need for that. They could kill him secretly without such measures. Even if he wouldn’t die easily, from their perspective, it seemed like a random suggestion.
Enkrid concluded it was probably just a casual remark.
“It’s an order from above. So, let’s go.”
Rem glared at him from the side. Behind him, Ragna offered to go again. In front of the tent, the devout soldier, large as a bear, prayed to the sky.
“O most holy Lord, do not take our small and precious squad leader. Do not test this weak servant.”
The 4th platoon leader couldn’t hide his astonishment. Who was taking anyone? And who was small and weak? The praying soldier’s bulging muscles were weapon-like. If that devout soldier was considered weak, there were few normal people in the world.
“It’s just this one time. Winter will come soon, and this campaign will end.”
They would reorganize the recon team for the next campaign. They wouldn’t leave the Troublemaker Squad leader in the recon team. Enkrid understood the platoon leader’s point.
Continuing war in winter was foolish. So this war would likely stop after autumn. There was no need to worry. Such things happened often.
Being called to fill in for various tasks wasn’t uncommon. While lacking combat talent, he was more than capable in other areas. Recon missions were no exception.
Despite his recent absence due to injury, his squad didn’t want to see him leave.
‘I am the best fit.’
It wasn’t baseless confidence. If he got lost, he could repeat the day. This mission was favorable for him. Avoiding danger was his specialty.
“It’s an order, 4th squad leader.”
The platoon leader’s voice sounded like a plea for rescue. Enkrid turned around. Rem was sharpening his axe. Ragna reiterated he could go. The praying soldier muttered about trials.
‘What a mood.’
It felt like they might revolt if he came back beaten. Were they always like this?
No, they weren’t.
When he first joined, they weren’t this involved with each other. When did this change?
‘Did they struggle without me?’
Even big eyes shook his head. But what could he do against orders from above? While his squad members were troublemakers, Enkrid wasn’t.
“I have to go.”
He exhaled deeply and spoke. It was a decision from above. Disobeying wasn’t an option. He could escape by any means, but there was no need. With Enkrid’s words, the mood settled. It was natural. Even if it was just a title, he was the leader of this six-man squad.
“Do as you wish.”
Rem snorted.
“I can still go.”
Ragna persisted, but it wouldn’t work. A scout who got lost even inside the camp? Impossible. Enkrid wondered how Ragna had survived his wandering.
Had he really traveled to the eastern sea?
Or had he just gotten lost and ended up there? A reasonable question.
But he didn’t ask. Enkrid always kept a reasonable distance from his squad. If they didn’t want to talk, he didn’t ask. That was squad leader Enkrid.
“Alright, fine.”
The 4th platoon leader turned away. He walked lighter than when he came, as if a burden was lifted from his shoulders. As the platoon leader left and he cleaned up, a minor commotion began in the tent.
“Are you practicing what you learned?”
Jaxon, leaning on his cot, started the conversation. Jaxon’s cot was in the farthest corner. Enkrid’s was at the front. Everyone heard Jaxon’s voice. Enkrid nodded reflexively. He had learned to train his hearing from Jaxon and surpassed the repeated days, so it made sense to ask. But Rem’s reaction was sour.
“What did you learn?”
Enkrid had learned various things from his squad members. From Rem, Ragna, and the devout soldier, he had picked up survival skills for the battlefield. He diligently learned but didn’t master them all, using them roughly. Perfect mastery was difficult.
The Heart of the Beast was the only skill he fully integrated, but he had never learned from Jaxon.
“What did you teach him?”
Rem sat up and asked.
“Keep it up. It’ll help.”
Jaxon ignored Rem completely. Rem’s eyes burned with anger.
“This bastard?”
“Don’t.”
Enkrid grabbed Rem’s shoulder.
“What did you learn from that sneaky guy? Learning anything might give you bad habits.”
“Hmph.”
Jaxon chuckled.
“Oh, right. It’s your time. Today’s the day. Want to become monster food on the plains?”
Jaxon ignored Rem’s threats. Enkrid sighed and pulled Rem back.
“Take it easy. It’s not like we’re fighting to the death.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll survive.”
That wasn’t the point.
“Who’s surviving?”
“O Lord, may I send this faithless soul to you? If you permit.”
Ragna and the devout soldier responded to Rem’s words.
“Stop, stop, stop. I’ll stop you every time you fight. Don’t waste your strength on pointless things.”
Enkrid wondered if taking the recon mission was the right choice. Was it right to leave these guys?
“Don’t worry too much. They usually don’t go all out. Just clash weapons a few times and stop.”
Kraiss said, counting silver coins from his pocket. That was the problem. Even those few clashes. To outsiders, it looked like they were killing each other. Despite being troublemakers, the commanders didn’t discharge them.
Why? Because of their exceptional skills. In battle, they were superior warriors. That’s why it made sense for Enkrid to join the recon team.
‘I’m not a loss to their strength.’
But these guys weren’t. This realization hit Enkrid again.
‘I have no talent.’
He had lost to a twelve-year-old. Even if the kid was a prodigy. An adult couldn’t handle the weight of a sword and lost to a child wielding it.
It wasn’t about pride.
It wasn’t a reason to be frustrated.
It just made him reflect. Did he give up?
No.
He just acknowledged his limits and kept going.
Was this the end?
No.
If he had no talent.
‘Someday.’
If he couldn’t take one step, he would take half steps.
If he didn’t stop moving forward.
Enkrid never stopped moving forward.
Feeling restless, he grabbed his sword and went outside.
He needed to swing his sword and sweat to sleep.
Ragna followed him.
“Let’s see your stance.”
“I’m here too.”
Rem joined them. Their eyes met, and the tension was palpable. It felt like a storm would erupt between them.
“Practice consistently. It’s better than sloppy swordsmanship.”
Jaxon’s voice came from his bed. Rem and Ragna glared at him.
“Sloppy?”
Rem said.
“Swordsmanship?”
Ragna continued.
“Didn’t you both say you’d watch my stance?”
Enkrid stepped between them. After calming them down, Enkrid went outside the tent. He swung his sword, taking their advice and criticism into account. Another day passed, drenched in sweat. At dawn, he would temporarily join the recon platoon.
He wasn’t worried. He didn’t think it would be difficult. After sweating, the mood had lightened. Enkrid, after washing by the stream, slept soundly.
“Company commander, why specifically send that guy to the recon team?”
The elf company commander noticed the 1st platoon leader standing by the torch stand.
“Move away from the torch stand. If it falls, there could be a fire.”
“Pardon?”
“Step aside.”
“Yes.”
The 1st platoon leader stepped aside. The company commander’s tent was larger and taller than regular tents. There was a torch stand in the center for light. There was also a rough table for meetings. They decided on the company’s recon routes there. It was during one of these meetings that the 1st platoon leader asked.
It was a reasonable question. The 1st platoon leader was also the company commander’s adjutant, a long-standing tradition in the Cyprus Brigade.
“He’s a perceptive soldier who knows how to find his way. He seemed suitable.”
“Yes, I see.”
It wasn’t a heavily weighted decision. It was an intuitive assignment. There wasn’t a specific reason. If asked, she would simply say it felt right. The company commander’s judgment was correct.
Elven intuition was often sharper than a prophet’s words.
Chapter 23: Traces of the Niu
"Listen for sounds that are different from usual," Jaxon said.
The recon team's departure was in the blue dawn before sunrise. As Enkrid gathered his gear, Jaxon, who had been on the last watch, spoke up.
"All of a sudden?"
Enkrid asked, unsure of what he meant.
"You asked me how to avoid getting hit by a sword on the battlefield."
Enkrid retraced his memories. The medical tent, the assassin's attack, the elf company commander, Crang, the fire. He had just returned from all that chaos to find his troublemaking squad fighting. No wonder his mind was scattered. He remembered asking that question just before dancing with death and the assassin.
"I understand how to listen well, but I can't stay focused on listening all the time in the middle of a battlefield. How do you dodge without looking back?"
Training one's hearing was fine, but it required intense concentration. Could he really focus on listening like that in the midst of a battlefield?
'It's difficult.'
Having tried it, he knew. It might become second nature with practice, allowing for near-miraculous movements against multiple opponents.
But just listening wasn't enough. Jaxon had been diligent. He hadn't ignored Enkrid's passing question and answered earnestly. And Enkrid was even more diligent. He never missed an opportunity to learn.
"You mean to sense the oddness?"
"It's good if you can awaken a different sense, but that's not easy. So in a grassy field, listen carefully to the rustling of the grass and find the sound that doesn't match."
Their recon area was a grassy field. The grass ranged from knee-high to waist-high. It seemed Jaxon knew this and gave appropriate advice. As he listened to the detailed answer, Enkrid asked curiously.
"Why are you explaining so thoroughly?"
Jaxon looked straight into Enkrid's eyes, as if to say, "You already know why."
When Enkrid tilted his head in confusion, Jaxon finally explained.
"Because you're relentless."
"...What?"
Where had this conversation gone off track? Why was he suddenly being called relentless? Jaxon knew the squad leader's tenacity and passion for the sword. That's why he said it. But Enkrid had no idea. He was about to ask more but then closed his mouth.
Did the reason matter?
The troublemaking squad members were unpredictable. So reasons didn't matter. Here was someone to learn from, someone teaching, and teaching valuable content at that. Being pulled into the recon team, he could reflect on this and train while on the mission. Thus, he ignored unnecessary questions.
"How do I distinguish different sounds?"
Enkrid quickly erased any signs of confusion and got back to the point. Jaxon's gaze was peculiar. It was as if he were looking at a three-headed dragon.
"Why?"
"Nothing."
Jaxon continued explaining. What were odd sounds? How should one use their hearing? It was excellent. Enkrid enjoyed learning immensely and set off in high spirits.
"So that's how it is."
Jaxon continued to watch him with that peculiar look, but Enkrid didn't notice and turned away.
"I'll be back."
He walked towards the outskirts of the camp for his recon mission. Watching him leave, Jaxon thought.
'This doesn't make sense.'
He had recently seen the squad leader react to sounds from a considerable distance. His hearing range was quite wide. No one else might notice, but Jaxon couldn't be fooled.
It was just strange. Applying all the training methods he knew, how had the squad leader achieved this level?
'He has excellent hearing but is a novice at distinguishing sounds.'
It was as if he had intensely trained just to hear for a short period. But could that be achieved with mere training?
If he had dozens of spare lives, maybe he could train like that.
'It's strange.'
The squad leader was truly strange. Regardless, Jaxon had shared what he knew. And the squad leader would soon absorb it. Training one's hearing was hard. Distinguishing and categorizing sounds was just an additional skill. Returning to the tent after his watch, Jaxon saw Rem lying sideways, smirking at him.
"Your eyes are annoying," Jaxon greeted him.
Rem smiled softly and replied.
"Have you fallen for the squad leader's charm too? Watching him makes you want to teach him, right?"
"It's a fair trade. I owe him a debt, and I'll get equal value later."
Equivalent exchange Jaxon. That was his nickname within the unit.
But even as he spoke, Jaxon knew. Teaching the squad leader wasn't about getting something in return. It was an impulsive decision. Perhaps his recent impressive performance on the battlefield had left an impression.
Jaxon didn't think too deeply about it. Sometimes, acting on a whim wasn't bad. So this matter ended here.
"Fuck off, bastard. Acting shy like a girl."
Rem laughed and lay down, pulling the blanket up to his chin and soon breathing evenly. Sometimes Jaxon wondered. What gave that crazy savage the confidence to act like that?
"Go lie down. If you attack while I'm asleep, I'll split your head open."
Rem, pretending to sleep, said. Jaxon ignored him and found his spot. Arguing with him would only lead to more words.
"Damn bastard, never answers."
As expected, Rem grumbled after speaking.
The recon team's departure before dawn started off rocky.
"If we meet those Azpen bastards, we'll crack their skulls. Got it?"
That was the recon squad leader's command. Enkrid almost asked what he thought recon was, but the squad leader spoke faster.
"Troublemaker squad leader, you're just a soldier now. If you disobey orders, speak up now. We'll settle it with our skills. Unlike some, I didn't become a squad leader by kissing ass."
His tone was harsh. Enkrid wasn't angry. He didn't even feel particularly annoyed. He'd heard such insults countless times. Casual insults from those who didn't know him meant nothing. And he thought it better to quietly patrol and reflect on what he'd learned.
"Just bear with it. He seems to have a bit of an ego."
A gruff, older soldier beside him said.
"Don't worry."
"Good."
The soldier beside him smiled subtly, avoiding the squad leader's gaze. He had a pleasant impression.
"Let's move out!"
The team of ten, both recon and patrol, set off. Recon didn't always involve infiltrating enemy territory. This plain, known as the Green Pearl of the continent, was a vast grassland. To the east were gentle hills and a few modest mountains. But overall, it was a wide-open area with no obstructions. To the west flowed the Pen-Hanil River, the lifeline of Naurillia, which the enemy Azpen Duchy also shared. Due to the terrain, ambushes in this plain were nearly impossible.
So what did the recon team do?
They scouted enemy positions and patrolled the area. Checking for any movements during the day or night. Watching for signs of enemy cavalry or any unusual activities. They also checked key locations.
Of course, recon was dangerous. They could encounter the enemy at any time. Skirmishes between recon teams often escalated into full battles. But such incidents weren't frequent. They shouldn't be.
"Let's show the greatness of Naurillia's infantry."
Enkrid thought the young squad leader was a fool, drunk on his own skill.
Was he some noble's bastard? Or did he have connections in the command? He looked about nineteen or twenty. It was a rapid promotion for a regular Naurillia army squad leader. But compared to true prodigies, he was nothing special. The recon squad leader seemed to forget their role entirely. Some soldiers agreed with him.
"Of course. With your skill, a few enemies are nothing."
"Show us the strength that took down five mercenaries!"
'This squad leader will be in for a surprise.'
It was obvious how this situation had come about. Recon soldiers had been injured, leaving them short-handed. That's why Enkrid and these idiots were here.
Even so, these guys were below average. But there would be no problems. The recon route was predetermined.
'Patrol in a circle around the camp.'
The detailed route was up to the squad leader. Enkrid organized the information in his mind, hoping the recon squad leader wouldn't mess up.
"These are nu footprints."
The squad leader pointed to tracks. Nu were animals that roamed the plains in herds. They traveled in groups of twenty to fifty.
"If we follow these, we'll feast today. Let's have a barbecue."
...Chase twenty nu? The tracks weren't even nu. They were gazelle.
"Well."
The pleasant-looking soldier behind him murmured. He seemed just as dumbfounded, glancing at the squad leader's back with a smirk. On the first day, the recon team wandered aimlessly, searching for nonexistent nu. No animal would present itself to a noisy group.
"Damn it."
The squad leader grumbled. If they had caught nu, would he have really started a fire? It would have been a sight. A recon team trying to be stealthy lighting a campfire.
'Might as well shout, "We're idiots!"'
It was probably fortunate they caught nothing. Before sunset, they found a spot with a hill and four large trees and prepared to camp.
"Where are you from, troublemaker squad leader?"
The soldier with the good first impression, who had been disdainful of the squad leader, asked.
"Border Guard."
"A professional soldier?"
Enkrid nodded. Border Guard was a fortress city on the frontier. It had farms and merchants but was fundamentally a military city. Full of training facilities and professional soldiers.
"I'm from a mountain village, good at hunting, but I was shocked when he called those tracks nu. They were gazelle."
Enkrid was just as shocked. They found common ground. The soldier's name was Enri. He had a gentle demeanor but clearly disliked the squad leader.
"Tomorrow, I'll show you something interesting. The plains may seem pathless, but animals have their trails."
After chatting for a bit, Enri quickly fell asleep. On his third watch, Enkrid recalled Jaxon's lessons. He didn't hold a sword but mimed the movements, reflecting on what he'd learned. The duel with Ragna and Rem before the recon mission had been helpful.
"Strike from any stance."
That was Rem's advice. He was training for that as well. Rem had shown him the technique. He had to train his lower body. Recon involved a lot of walking. Without horses, there was no choice.
'Walking is good.'
It was good for building leg strength. Despite only eating jerky, Enkrid didn't feel hungry. He was too focused on his training and techniques. His mind was occupied with what to do now and what to train in the future, his sword skills, Jaxon's hearing lessons, and Enri's hunting tips.
He purely enjoyed learning and improving. Of course, he also enjoyed applying what he learned.
'When I return, I'll spar again.'
Throughout his watch, Enkrid practiced distinguishing sounds. He woke the next watch and fell asleep.
On the second day, after sunrise, the recon team set out again. In the morning, Enri taught him to recognize animal trails. He listened to the sounds of the grass brushing against his legs.
'So much to learn.'
Enkrid genuinely felt this way. Enri's hunting knowledge was fascinating. He hadn't had the chance to learn such things before.
"This way."
The recon squad leader led them into a field of tall weeds.
'Not bad.'
Despite his earlier bravado, the route was reasonable. It was one of the assigned checkpoints. But the squad leader soon shattered Enkrid's expectations.
"We'll cut through the weeds and track the enemy scouts. How about it?"
Was he insane? Enkrid almost blurted it out but held back. What could they see or track in the tall weeds? How would this lead to finding enemy scouts? Instead of just checking for anomalies or ambushes.
"Don't interfere. Not all squad leaders are the same."
A subordinate spoke, trying to calm him.
Heh.
Enkrid wasn't angry. He just wondered if he should let this slide. The decision was quick. He decided to let it slide. If things went wrong and he died, he'd reconsider the next day.
If not.
'We'll just waste time and return.'
It wouldn't be a loss for him either way.
Chapter 24: Three
"The wind is blowing this way now, but see how these short grasses are bent in the opposite direction, and they form a circular pattern?"
Enri pressed down on the base of the tall grass with his foot, pushing it aside to reveal the shorter grass underneath.
"You see the tracks here?" he continued.
"Yeah, I see them."
Enkrid replied while closely examining the ground. He understood now that Enri pointed it out, but finding these signs alone would have been difficult. They were in the midst of a field of tall grass. Looking around, all they could see was a sea of green.
A traveling bard had named this area "Green Pearl" after passing through the plains during midsummer signifying the lushness of the area.
It made sense. This damned grassland was not a pleasant place for humans to navigate. The swaying grass would slap against their faces and eyes, while insects clung to their bodies, and crickets and locusts jumped around them. In places where water had pooled, frogs could be found.
Seeing the frogs reminded Enkrid of Frog, who had kicked him. Although Frog insisted that they were entirely different from frogs, Enkrid thought otherwise. Killing a frog in front of them wouldn't elicit a reaction, but threatening to burst their hearts would likely provoke a deadly response.
'One blow to the side.'
He had blocked it reflexively, but one blow was enough to knock him down. How long would it take for him to match Frog's strength?
Not now, but could he one day fight Frog?
He doubted it. Doubt was inevitable; not giving up didn't mean there was no doubt.
But there was no time for doubt. He had no time to waste worrying about things he couldn't control.
Enkrid dismissed the negative thoughts immediately. He couldn't afford to dwell on them. Spending energy on unsolvable issues was foolish.
Thinking this, he refocused on Enri's explanation.
The soldier, a hunter from the plains, was undeniably optimistic. He tolerated their foolish squad leader's actions and even urged Enkrid to be patient with him. Not that Enkrid had anything to tolerate; he was used to it. Despite the situation, Enri used his hunting skills to observe and analyze their surroundings. It was interesting to hear.
"There aren't many animal droppings. Why is that?" Enri pondered.
"Is that a problem?" Enkrid asked, pushing away the thick, long grass that kept falling over his head.
"This grassland may look like a useless weed patch, but it's actually a treasure trove for animals that feed on this grass. There should be more animal traces here, but they're scarce."
Fewer animals. Why? Enkrid wondered as he picked off a bug clinging to his cheek. It wasn't a leech, but it extended something sharp from its mouth as if trying to suck blood. Seeing the bug and the obstructing grass made him want to grab a sharp sickle and cut it all down.
"Shh, you talk too much," the squad leader said, glancing back. He frowned as a cricket jumped past his face but didn't complain.
'That's surprising.'
Enkrid hadn’t expected him to whine about the situation since he had insisted on coming here. Despite being called "Green Pearl," many of the grasses were tinged with a light brown hue, a sign that autumn was approaching. In winter, this lush grassland would disappear, leaving only traces behind. In the warmth of spring, new tall grass would grow, repeating the cycle.
'Death and rebirth.'
Was this the way of nature? What about his own repetitive days?
Even though he tried not to think about it, the thoughts lingered. It was impossible to ignore the repeated days.
But Enkrid had made a clear decision.
'Use everything.'
He didn't see it as a blessing. Even if it was a curse, nothing would change. After walking through the tall grass for a long time, someone tapped Enkrid on the shoulder. It wasn't Enri. It was the soldier who had stuck close to the squad leader.
"Our squad leader may seem childish, but he's got his reasons. He needs to make a name for himself, but they keep sending him on these recon missions, so he's frustrated."
What a strange thing to say.
"And if you could forget about that 'asshole' comment, I'd appreciate it."
Odd timing, Enkrid thought. Even so, he accepted the apology. There was no benefit in creating tension during a mission.
"Sure."
"Thanks, you're a generous squad leader," the soldier said with a smile. His faded blond hair and rugged face were the opposite of Big Eyes, making him quite unattractive.
Nodding, Enkrid turned his focus back to his surroundings, a habit of his. At that moment, an unfamiliar sound reached his ears.
A rustling sound, a hiss, and a crackling noise.
What Enkrid had learned from Jaxon paid off.
'That sounds different.'
The ten members of the recon team walked close enough to touch shoulders but with enough space to see each other's backs. The sound of their movement through the grass was now familiar.
But this new sound was different. It came from further away and was unmistakably the sound of people moving through the grass, mixed with the hiss of an animal and the rustle of grass underfoot.
People. They weren't friendly.
The tall grassland itself was not valuable. Its significance lay in the enemy territory beyond. Beyond this grassland was an open plain with no cover. Moving through it wasn't smart. Was there another squad leader as foolish as theirs on the enemy side?
"There are others besides us," Enkrid said. The soldier in front of him blinked.
"What?"
He looked puzzled, tilting his head and furrowing his brows.
"I think I heard something too," Enri added.
"What did you hear?"
The squad leader asked, stepping back to approach Enkrid.
"The enemy."
No sooner had he spoken than they were attacked.
Ping! Thud!
Before the squad leader could react, an arrow struck the head of the leading soldier. Enkrid quickly assessed the direction of the attack and the type of arrow.
'A bolt.'
A short arrow, good for close range. It wasn't used with a longbow.
'A crossbow.'
The conclusion was clear. As the leading soldier's head was pierced, Enkrid shouted.
"Get down!"
At the same time, he grabbed the squad leader's collar and pulled him down.
"Ugh!"
The squad leader let out a grunt as he hit the ground. Just then, the sounds of pain and death filled the air.
'Front, right, left.'
Even if they avoided the first volley, death was inevitable. They needed to break through. They couldn't stop. Enkrid flattened himself against the ground and launched himself in one direction.
Rustle, crack!
The grass parted, alerting the enemy to his movement. As expected, a flurry of bolts followed.
"Foolish!"
Enri exclaimed, shocked by what appeared to be a suicidal move.
Thwack!
Luck played a part, but Enkrid avoided most of the bolts. One struck his left shoulder, but he saw the enemy. They had cleared some of the tall grass to create a space for movement. He saw a soldier in green clothing holding a crossbow.
Drawing his sword, he advanced.
'Anytime, from any position.'
Executing the best attack. Enkrid acted on what he had learned. He closed the distance, pushing off the ground with his left foot and thrusting with one hand.
The point of his arming sword pierced the air and slashed the enemy's neck. The sharp blade cut through the thin skin of the neck, sending a spray of blood into the air. The soldier clutched his throat and collapsed.
Enkrid didn't stop.
He moved left, dodging a spear thrust aimed at his chest. Pretending to advance, he halted, letting the spear miss. The enemy soldier's eyes, filled with a mix of excitement and fear, were visible.
A soldier's eyes in battle.
Crossbows, spears, green-dyed clothes. They were equipped for ambush. He absorbed this information quickly and took another step, slashing horizontally.
The spearman dodged and countered with a thrust. Enkrid pivoted on his right foot and spun, delivering a thrust of his own.
Combining attack and defense into one move.
His sword pierced the enemy's torso, meeting resistance as it cut through the thick fabric of the soldier's armor.
"Grghhh."
The wounded soldier dropped his spear and grabbed Enkrid's sword with both hands, blood streaming from his palms.
'I can't pull it out.'
Quick decisions and actions. A rule for survival in battle. Enkrid let go of the sword and grabbed the fallen spear.
Wham!
Another soldier swung his crossbow at Enkrid's head. His crouched position saved him as the crossbow missed his head but knocked off his arming cap. The cool air hit his scalp. Enkrid drove the spear into the foot of the soldier who had swung the crossbow.
"Argh!"
Pain triggered a scream, which drew attention. A scream could demoralize the enemy. Enkrid twisted the soldier's knee, using a technique taught by the devout squad member. Though clumsy, it was effective. He grabbed the fallen soldier's shortsword, stood, and positioned it against the soldier's neck.
"Grrr!"
Before the soldier could react, he slid the blade into his throat and pulled it sideways.
Squelch.
The soldier clutched his throat, making gurgling sounds as blood poured out. He dropped to his knees, eyes wide in shock.
Breathing heavily, Enkriid used the dying soldier as a shield, crouching behind him to catch his breath.
'One side cleared.'
They were surrounded on three sides, but now one side was open. It gave him a potential escape route if things went south.
"...You're supposed to be a low-ranking soldier?"
Enri said, appearing behind him.
"That's right," Enkriid replied, still catching his breath. Enri shook his head in disbelief.
"This kind of skill is low-ranking?" he muttered.
"Damn it, I'm just an asshole," the squad leader grumbled, his idiotic comment cutting through the tension.
What was he even thinking?
"Stay behind, don't advance," the rugged-looking soldier advised, blocking the squad leader.
That left four of them alive. The rest of the recon team was dead. About twenty enemy soldiers still glared at them.
"...What the hell," one of the enemy soldiers said. He glanced between the dead bodies and Enkriid, who had killed three of their men.
Enkriid didn't care about their shock. His focus was on surviving the situation.
Crossbows were still a threat, and there were many enemies.
"I lost my sword."
"Run!"
Using the Valen Mercenary Sword technique, it was time to escape. Enkriid didn't hesitate, turning and sprinting away.
Chapter 25: Tall Grass Field
"Let’s push through this grass field and follow the recon team's trail. What do you think?"
When I looked again, the recon squad leader’s eyes were shining as he said this. Expectation, confidence, and a hint of tension mixed together. It was a new day. To cut to the chase, the escape failed. Enkrid opened his eyes and faced the new day by reflecting on yesterday.
'Where did it go wrong?'
Going east might have been a mistake.
'No, it seemed fine up to that point.'
Reviewing was Enkrid’s habit. While fleeing east, he encountered the crossbow unit again and fell, bolts piercing his body. He writhed on the ground and died when a bolt lodged in his head.
He hated recalling the pain from that moment, but if he didn't replay it, he would keep dying and that was worse.
Review and continuously search for the problem. Enkrid repeated his thoughts.
'Since I could hear it, I get the first opportunity.'
He caught a strange sound. What he learned from Jaxon helped. Afterward, the Heart of the Beast made him view the situation calmly. He had to choose one side and break through. He failed, though.
'If I do it again.'
He felt he could do it. He had been unlucky to run into the waiting unit rather than being caught by the pursuing one.
'I just need to find the right path.'
As he was lost in thought, someone tapped his shoulder. It was Enri. Enkrid realized he had been too deep in thought.
"Just look around quickly and move on, please."
What does he keep asking me to endure?
"You don’t look well."
Enri pointed ahead with his eyes. When he turned his gaze forward, he met the eyes of a rough-looking soldier following closely behind the squad leader. He looked like he was glaring, but he probably wasn’t trying to start a fight.
'Considering he wants me to understand the squad leader, he seems to have some sense.'
He was probably thinking of finding an opportunity to talk to me properly. Judging that it wasn’t the right time to speak, the rough-looking soldier averted his gaze first. Enkrid nodded at Enri and walked. He pushed the grass aside with his hand and entered. Soon, a familiar sight blocked his view. The tall green grass drastically limited visibility.
Certainly, facing an ambush in here was bad. Risking your life to come in here was not something anyone would usually do.
'What if we didn’t go in here in the first place?'
That wouldn’t work. The reason this unit was here was to recon the tall grass field.
What could they say if they returned without doing that?
They noticed the enemy's ambush before entering?
Even if they changed the reconing direction. The ten men here would never agree with that. It was unavoidable. Most of the new 'today' was always like this but if you ask if it was troublesome.
'Not bad.'
He had only fought properly once. Enri had asked him how he could be the lowest-ranking soldier. The squad leader had belittled himself.
'Actual combat.'
It was just one battle, but that one experience was valuable. The Heart of the Beast didn't leave any room for panic. He used every opportunity to wield and stab with his sword. He predicted the enemy’s actions and moved accordingly. He applied what he learned in between.
Thump.
His heart pounded. It felt like something thrilling pierced through his body.
'It's a good opportunity.'
Before setting out on the reconing mission, Rem and Ragna had alternately evaluated his swordsmanship. What he learned from them. What he realized on his own.
It was the perfect time to digest it all.
"Do you see here? The bent grass?"
"Beast footprints."
Enkrid was a man who knew how to use what he learned. He acted like he knew. Enri looked at Enkrid, rolled his eyes, and asked.
"You have hunting experience?"
He didn’t. He had learned it from Enri.
"I just heard things here and there."
He had heard it from Enri.
After honestly answering, they continued with trivial conversation. While doing so, he quickened his pace and moved forward. He was right behind the squad leader.
Enkrid was now assessing the recon team’s formation. It was something he hadn’t paid much attention to before. The squad leader was in the front, two on the right, two on the left. Right behind the squad leader was the rough-looking soldier. The remaining members followed behind like a rear guard.
'They're not just idiots.'
The formation was plausible. If the enemy appeared, it was a good shape for a response. It wouldn’t help much if they met a unit armed with crossbows. In the failed 'today,' the recon squad leader had stopped acting foolishly. He silently followed Enkrid's lead.
Additionally, his swordsmanship was quite decent. The rough-looking soldier was a very skilled soldier.
'At least mid-level or higher.'
By Naurillia soldier standards, that's what he seemed. Both the squad leader and the rough-looking soldier. Both had good skills.
Enri wasn’t bad either. He walked with a short bow in his left hand and could shoot rapidly. Not that it was a level where he could survive a volley of bolts.
'Avoid the crossbow units at all costs.'
Enkrid deliberately stuck close behind the squad leader. The rough-looking soldier, perhaps watching the squad leader's reactions, didn’t speak.
Rustle. Hiss! Crackle.
And he heard the same sound again.
"Duck."
He grabbed the back of the squad leader's neck and threw him back. Last time, only four survived to escape. This time, he would save a few more.
"Ugh!"
The squad leader let out a cry as he fell backward.
"Enemy!"
The enemy shouted. Bolts flew in immediately. Meanwhile, Enkrid kicked the backs of two allied soldiers' knees in succession. Bolts whizzed over the heads of the fallen soldiers. Enkrid also spread his legs and lowered his body. A grasshopper, startled, jumped away in front of him. Enkrid rose using the rebound of his thigh muscles and erector spinae while throwing a knife.
Ping!
The knife cut through the air. It hit nothing, but the enemy flinched momentarily. A brief gap, enough.
Whack.
He lightly tapped the squad leader's forehead with his elbow.
"Pull yourself together."
