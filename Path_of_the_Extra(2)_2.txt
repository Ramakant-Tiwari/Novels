A soul armor, or at least it would become one after the creature was slain.

Whoever consumed its mana core would inherit the armor.

But for now, it posed an ominous threat, waiting for the moment to strike.

Azriel's gaze hardened.

Most of the cadets were inexperienced, unprepared to face such a monster.

If it attacked, they would be slaughtered in seconds.

Those who weren't an awakened would have no chance.

'Anyone who isn't an awakened will have to stay back. If not, they'll just die miserably.'

Even as a Grade 1 beast, the Dark King was already one of the most formidable opponents on Earth.

As a Grade 2 monster?

They were walking into a death trap.

And...

Azriel knew why this was happening.

'This is all because of me, isn't it...?'

His survival had changed things—altered the plot.

The world was shifting, and Azriel planned to break it further.

But he hadn't anticipated a floor shift triggered by his very presence.

The void dungeon was reacting to him.

To him alone.

Azriel could feel it in his gut—a sinking sensation, a sense of hostility aimed at him.

The void dungeon didn't like him.

It was preparing, retaliating, adapting to eliminate him.

Since entering the void dungeon, something had felt wrong.

The floor shift wasn't just coincidence.

The void dungeon itself was preparing to kill Azriel.

'The dungeon senses it... my blessing. It knows what I am, but it only wants me.'

The void dungeon knew Azriel was an Apostle—The Apostle of Death.

It didn't react to Lumine or Vergil—only to him.

And it wanted him to know.

Ba-thump!

A chill ran down Azriel's spine as his heart thumped loudly in his chest, the sounds around him fading.

The crimson orbs of the Dark King were locked onto him.

It was looking straight at Azriel.

'You've got to be kidding me...!'

What had he done to earn this dungeon's hate?

He couldn't recall anything deserving of such wrath.

Yet here it was—an ancient, malevolent force focused entirely on him.

"Azriel... why is it only looking at you?"

Jasmine was the first to notice, of course. Her sharp intuition had already begun piecing things together.

Azriel kept his eyes locked on the Dark King, refusing to break the unsettling gaze.

"I don't know... maybe it's just a coincidence?"

He murmured, his voice low enough for only her to hear.

Jasmine scowled.

"Liar. Even in the beginning, the prowlers only had their eyes on you. And a floor shift like this on the first floor? It never happened until..."

"I came."

Azriel finished, a wry smile tugging at his lips.

"So, what do you want me to say, dear sister? That the dungeon is rolling out the red carpet for its guest—better yet, me? I genuinely don't know why it's targeting me, but it is. It wants me dead... There's a good chance the other floors have shifted too."

If the void dungeon was gunning for him specifically, it was likely the floors ahead were also distorted.

But what awaited him there?

A demon-ranked creature on the second floor?

'Maybe even a void rift will appear...'

Everything was unknown now, even to Azriel.

His fingers grew cold, his face paler.

That feeling of uncertainty... it both terrified and thrilled him.

"...We should cancel th—"

"No."

Azriel cut her off, and Jasmine's eyes widened in surprise.

"We're overreacting," he said, more firmly now. "Even if a Grade 2 monster stands before us, why should we back off? Neither of us, nor the instructors, will need to lift a finger."

Not when Azriel had an ace up his sleeve—a factor the dungeon hadn't accounted for.

The protagonist.

Lumine Versille.

All he had to do was let Lumine handle the heavy lifting.

Besides, a demon-ranked void creature wouldn't appear this early.

The dungeon had its limits—it could only shift so much, and only certain void creatures could spawn on specific floors.

At least that is what Azriel believes.

Jasmine sighed, her expression solemn as she looked at his face.

"Fine... but you're staying in my line of sight."

Azriel's lips curled into a soft smile.

She couldn't blame him for wanting to press on, though there was no telling what else could happen.

"Sure."

'I'll stay in your sight... for now.'

Just as he finished that thought, a sudden change occurred.

""...!""

Four black holes, each the size of a human, appeared on the circular platform.

Black mist began to pour out of them, thick and ominous...

The Dark King was finally making its move.

Chapter 76: The Dark King of Imperion [3]

A shudder ran down Celestina's spine as she watched four identical figures, clad in knight armor, emerge from the black holes.

They looked just like the Dark King chained to the throne, but there was a crucial difference.

Unlike the original, these clones were not bound by chains, nor seated upon an obsidian throne.

Each one gripped a silver sword, their crimson eyes gleaming with malevolence as they stared at the group.

And...

'They're all Grade 2 monsters...!?'

Celestina's thoughts raced in disbelief.

Each clone held the same mana core level as the Dark King itself.

The realization hit her hard—how were they supposed to fight four Grade 2 monsters at the same time, on the first floor no less?

And that was without even considering the original Dark King, still seated on his throne.

With him in the mix...

Celestina had no idea what other abilities the true Dark King might be hiding.

'At least it seems like he won't leave his seat...'

As long as he stayed put, maybe—just maybe—the battle wouldn't be impossible.

Still, it felt like the dungeon was punishing them for their relatively easy journey so far.

Which, in a way, it was.

"...Anyone who isn't an awakened should stay back for this fight," Celestina ordered, her voice calm but commanding.

None of the cadets argued.

They weren't foolish enough to think they could stand against a floor boss of this level.

One by one, they stepped back, leaving only a handful standing:

Lumine, Yelena, Vergil, and three other cadets.

Celestina glanced at each of them, their eyes locked on the Dark King's clones.

'Six against four—five, counting the original... but,'

her gaze shifted to Azriel, standing next to Jasmine and the instructors. He hadn't moved an inch.

A flicker of disappointment passed through her.

'...Fine.'

He trusted her to handle this, and she wasn't about to let herself—or anyone else—down.

Suddenly, a radiant silver light enveloped Celestina, the glow matching the shimmer of her hair.

As the brilliance intensified, a magnificent suit of armor materialized over her academy clothes.

Beautiful silver engravings adorned every inch of the gleaming gunmetal armor, hugging her form perfectly.

The divine aura it projected made her seem almost otherworldly.

The other cadets gaped at her transformation.

"...Wow."

"Seriously, she looks like a different person."

Despite their praise, Celestina felt a bit self-conscious but maintained a stoic expression.

'It fits perfectly, as always,' she thought, admiring her soul armor.

Excitement bubbled within her; opportunities to use her soul armor had been scarce, but now? Now, she could wear it with pride.

'Hehe, it suits me,'

She couldn't help feeling relieved—it would've been awful if the armor had looked ugly.

After all, no matter what, she still cared about her appearance.

"I really need to get one of those myself."

"I wish I were a princess too," came Lumine and Yelena's voices, breaking her focus.

Celestina's lips twitched at their banter.

It was almost like they had forgotten about the Dark Kings before them—but of course, they hadn't.

They were simply waiting.

"So, are we going, or what, Princess?"

Vergil's blunt voice cut through the air.

He didn't even glance at her, his gaze fixed on the floor bosses.

Though he had apologized the day before, thanks to Azriel, it was clear he still didn't care much.

His eyes held a look of sheer boredom.

'Right... he's always been crazy.'

Celestina thought, remembering how Vergil had never shied away from fighting void creatures alone, streaming his battles online for the world to see.

Taking a deep breath, she focused on the four Dark Kings.

"Let's go."

The moment Celestina spoke, a gust of wind swept through the room, sending her hair and that of the other cadets flying.

Bam!

A loud crash reverberated through the boss room, echoing off the walls.

"What..."

Her eyes widened in shock at the sight in the center of the platform—Lumine, standing with one of the Dark King's clones limp in his grip.

With a powerful squeeze, he crushed its neck, shattering the clone's armor in an instant.

The entire creature dissolved into a thick, dark liquid, splattering across Lumine's hands, feet, and the floor.

Lumine's face twisted in disgust.

"Why do I always have to get filthy?"

"Show-off."

Yelena, standing beside Celestina, stared blankly at Lumine, while Vergil clicked his tongue before charging toward the remaining Dark King clones.

'How is he already this strong?'

Celestina wondered, but there was no time to dwell on Lumine's strength.

Another black hole appeared, and with it, another Dark King clone stepped out.

Her expression hardened at the sight.

'...Don't tell me they'll keep spawning until the real one is defeated.'

She couldn't help but question how much mana it would take for the Dark King to run out—shouldn't he have already?

Celestina didn't hesitate. She bent her knees and with a powerful kick, launched herself at one of the Dark King's clones, her silver sword gleaming in her grip.

CLANG!

Her blade met the clone's with a jarring clash, the impact sending a shock through her arm, numbing it.

She gritted her teeth, muscles trembling under the force.

'Too strong...'

The thought flashed in her mind.

The clone moved with inhuman speed, swinging its blade in a wide horizontal arc.

Celestina ducked just in time, her own sword thrusting forward in retaliation.

It was fast, but not fast enough.

The clone sidestepped, her strike barely missing its chest by the breath of a second.

The ground beneath the clone cracked as it brought its sword down with monstrous force, the air itself seeming to tremble.

Celestina's face tightened, her instincts screaming as the blade bore down toward her.

In a desperate move, she threw her left hand forward, a brilliant white glow bursting from her palm.

The light blinded the clone, or so she thought.

It moved as if the flash meant nothing, its sword already descending toward her head.

Whish—

A green arrow, humming with energy, sliced through the air and collided with the clone's sword.

The force knocked it off balance, sending it stumbling back.

Celestina's heart raced as she turned, her eyes locking with Yelena's.

Her ally stood poised, bow drawn, another arrow of glowing green mana forming around the string.

Yelena gave her a sharp nod.

"She can shape her mana..."

Celestina realized in awe, but there was no time for thoughts.

The clone lunged at her once more.

This time, Celestina was ready.

She rolled to the side, her silver blade flashing in the dim light as she struck.

The sword cleaved into the clone's side with devastating precision, sending it crashing to the ground.

Armor shards exploded in every direction, revealing only blackness—an endless void where a body should have been.

A pit of darkness, seething and unnatural.

Celestina wasted no breath.

She drove her sword deep into the gap in its armor.

The clone shuddered before dissolving into a swirling pool of dark liquid, just like the one Lumine had slain moments before.

Chapter 77: The Dark King of Imperion [4]

Celestina took a few steps back from the dark liquid pooling at her feet and scanned the battlefield.

Lumine was locked in a fierce struggle with one of the clones.

Each time it regenerated, it did so faster, leaving him no moment to breathe.

It was clear that the Dark King was channeling most of its energy into targeting Lumine.

Vergil, on the other hand, was engaged in a more passive combat. He moved with a disinterested air, barely breaking a sweat as he dodged the clone's strikes, each miss coming dangerously close.

Celestina's gaze shifted to the far side of the circular platform where Yelena and another cadet were working in tandem against the final clone.

They kept their distance, skillfully using their bows to harass the clone from afar.

While two other cadets were fighting the clone up close.

Celestina's attention returned to the Dark King, seated imperiously on its throne.

It remained motionless, its head never turning, its red eyes fixed ahead in an unblinking stare.

Celestina furrowed her brows in confusion.

'Is it even alive?'

It was unsettling.

The Dark King seemed to be using most of its mana to obstruct Lumine, yet it made no other moves.

Why?

Her gaze followed the Dark King's unyielding stare, searching for a clue.

To her growing bewilderment, she noticed that while most of the cadets avoided its path of gaze out of fear, one individual stood out.

'Azriel?'

The Dark King's gaze was fixed on Azriel, who returned the stare with an intensity that bordered on defiant.

Jasmine stood beside him, her eyes and that of the instructors darting nervously between the Dark King and Azriel.

'Why Azriel?'

Celestina wondered.

'Is it afraid of him?'

It didn't make sense.

Azriel was undoubtedly the strongest first-year, but the instructors, including Jasmine, were more powerful.

Why single him out?

Celestina struggled to read Azriel's expression, deepening her frustration.

'The Dark King isn't reacting because of Azriel. But why?'

Determined to act, she prepared to sprint toward the Dark King, but her resolve was interrupted.

The clone she had defeated reappeared right before her, forcing her to jump back and raise her sword in defense.

'We can't keep this up forever,' Celestina thought grimly.

'We'll exhaust ourselves before it does.'

The clones didn't tire like humans, and the Dark King had the mana to keep summoning them.

But surely it had a limit—why else would it only produce four clones?

She hoped at least it did.

With renewed resolve, Celestina's back began to glow white, catching the attention of the others.

""!!""

They stared in surprise as two luminous, feathered wings unfurled from her back.

With a powerful flap, she ascended into the air.

From above, she surveyed the entire platform.

The clone below watched her intently.

'I can't maintain this for long or my mana will drain.'

The effort to keep her wings aloft was consuming her mana at a rapid rate.

She flew swiftly toward the Dark King, knowing that reaching it was the only way to end this battle.

"...!"

Just as she neared her target, a black sword materialized in her line of sight, slicing through the air with deadly intent.

Instinctively, she veered to the left, feeling the sword's edge graze her hair.

Her heart raced as she looked toward the source of the attack.

Her face darkened in realization.

The clone she thought she had left behind was now airborne, sporting bat-like wings and floating menacingly in front of her.

Though its face was hidden, the mocking crimson eyes were unmistakable.

It was clear now—the clone was as adept in the air as she was.

*****

Lumine gritted his teeth as he faced the clone in front of him.

Things were dire.

Celestina was locked in an aerial battle, while Yelena and three other cadets were struggling in a stalemate with their clone.

Yelena was trying to manage the chaos, splitting her attention to support everyone she could.

Vergil was engaged in a relentless dance with his own opponent.

Despite Lumine' skill, he couldn't gain the upper hand; every time he defeated a clone, another appeared almost instantly.

What frustrated him most was that the Dark King remained indifferent, its gaze fixed elsewhere.

'Why is it acting like that? Azriel is not even helping...!'

Lumine's frustration boiled over.

He had been frustrated over the past two days for various reasons, but the main one was undoubtedly the quest.

It had taken a toll on his mental health.

He couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong, and the sudden floor shift with the boss didn't offer much hope.

With a powerful kick, Lumine decapitated the clone's head, turning it into dark liquid.

But before he could catch his breath, another black hole opened in front of him, spitting out another clone.

Lumine's eyes narrowed.

This new clone was different—much taller and wielding a greatsword.

'A greatsword, huh...'

Lumine noted, realizing the clones were adapting to their opponents.

He bent his knees as the floor cracked beneath him, then lunged at the new clone.

Clang!

His sword collided with the greatsword, sending a jolt through his entire body.

'Crap!'

Lumine thought, reacting too late as the clone's kick slammed into his abdomen.

"Uhk!"

Blood spattered from his mouth as he was hurled through the air, crashing to the ground.

"Lumine!"

Yelena's distant shout pierced his ringing ears.

A hollow laugh escaped him.

'So this is why even a lower-ranked void creature shouldn't be underestimated...'

Even with his strength, it didn't feel like enough.

His mind was scattered, unable to focus properly amidst the chaos.

As his blurred vision cleared, he saw the greatsword descending toward him.

With a desperate kick off the ground, he dodged the blade that shattered the space where he had been moments before.

He tumbled forward but managed to regain his footing.

Lumine coughed, wiping the blood from his lips.

'Just a single kick did this...'

He clenched his fists, his body enveloped in a golden glow.

This was one of his skills, enhancing his physical abilities.

Flames erupted from his hands, crawling up his sword's blade.

'No more.'

'I can't reveal everything just yet.'

Lumine lunged at the brute, delivering a horizontal sweep.

The clone parried his strike effortlessly, seemingly unaffected by his enhanced combination of an attack.

Xiu—

A glowing green arrow whizzed by, piercing the clone's left heel.

Lumine seized the opportunity, thrusting his sword into the clone's chest.

Shards of armor flew as flames engulfed the clone's body.

Yet, despite the searing heat, it didn't dissolve like the others.

'What the hell…!'

Lumine thought, panic rising as he jumped back releasing his sword and summoned it back to his hand.

The clone remained standing, its body wreathed in flames but undeterred.

'It's resistant to heat!'

Lumine realized, frustration mounting.

His fire affinity wasn't enough; the flames weren't burning it as he had hoped.

'I don't want to use another skill, but...'

He hesitated.

Unlike the elite of the great clans, he wasn't too reliant on his sword.

He couldn't.

He had no one to teach him.

He possessed many skills and affinities, but revealing them now could have severe consequences he wasn't ready to face.

The burning clone advanced steadily, its greatsword ablaze yet unmelting.

As it approached, Lumine stepped back, knowing that while he was resistant to fire, he wasn't immune.

The moment Lumine's senses sharpened, the clone's movements froze.

His grip tightened on his sword, bracing for the imminent strike as the clone's greatsword began its ascent.

And then...

Klink...!

The searing helmet of the clone clattered to the ground, its head gone as it stood before Lumine.

He blinked in stunned silence as the clone collapsed to its knees, dropping the greatsword with a heavy thud before disintegrating into a pool of dark liquid.

'What..?'

Even the fire was gone.

"Nice job weakening it. Made it easier for me to invade its mind, though I'm not sure how I managed that—it didn't even seem to have one."

Lumine whirled around, eyes wide.

There, standing with an air of casual nonchalance, was Vergil—unscathed, his academy uniform pristine, a smirk playing on his lips as he watched the dark liquid seep away.

"Y-you... did that?"

He made the clone kill itself?

Vergil shrugged, a dismissive gesture.

"What of it? Your fight was dragging on anyway."

Lumine could only stare in disbelief, mouth agape.

What kind of skill was that? An unique skill? A rare affinity?

"Hoo..."

He chose not to ask, instead opting for gratitude.

"Thank you... You saved me."

Vergil waved off the thanks with a lazy flick of his hand.

"It's nothing. Besides, Azriel told me I should make amends with you. I guess I was only half-hearted yesterday."

"Right..."

Lumine nodded, still processing the unexpected turn of events.

He glanced at Azriel, who was observing the boss with a contemplative look.

"You and Azriel are...?"

"We're friends. We made up the next morning we fought—or at least, when we almost did."

'I didn't know that...'

But there was no time for further inquiries.

Lumine scanned the platform, noting the dark liquid where the last clone had been.

There was no sign of a black hole or another clone in sight.

The cadets and Yelena, who had been engaged with the other clone, were now sprawled on the ground, panting heavily, their opponent no longer a threat.

Vergil must have finished his fight, or else he wouldn't be here.

Which meant that the last clone was the one Celestina was battling in the—

Bam—!

Lumine and the others flinched as something crashed down beside them, dust settling around the impact.

'What just happened...?'

When the dust cleared, Celestina was revealed, her silver hair disheveled as she stood atop a bat-winged clone.

With a glare, she drove her sword into its chest, and the clone twitched before dissolving into dark liquid.

"...."

"...Damn, remind me never to piss off the princess."

Chapter 78: The Dark King of Imperion [5]

Celestina's face twisted in anguish, her once radiant silver armor now drenched in the thick, dark blood of the clones she had just slain.

Her boots, slick from the pool beneath her feet, slid as she staggered backward.

Her gaze flickered to the other cadets huddled close.

No more clones came from the shadows.

The black holes had stopped spitting out the abominations.

There was a stillness, but it wasn't the relief she craved.

It was a false calm, a silence that felt far too unnatural.

Her eyes drifted toward the Dark King.

Ba-thump!

Her heart pounded in her chest, echoing louder than the silence around her.

Ba-thump!

The air itself seemed to constrict as if the very world was holding its breath, waiting.

Ba-thump!

The Dark King stirred.

Ba-thump!

Its crimson orbs locked onto her.

Ba-thump!

Not Azriel.

Ba-thump!

Her.

Ba-thump!

Her breath hitched.

Cold sweat slicked her skin, trickling down her spine like icy fingers.

The hairs on her neck stood rigid.

The King's gaze was piercing, not merely seeing her—but into her.

It wasn't just a stare.

It was rage, pure and primal, swirling behind the Dark King's helmet.

It hated her.

The way it looked at her, its unblinking eyes bore into her soul.

The fury radiating off it was almost a physical force, pressing down on her.

She swore it was commanding her to kneel, demanding submission without a single word.

"Princess Celestina... what should we do?" a voice, trembling and unsure, broke the suffocating silence.

The cadet who spoke was pale, his face etched with fear, his eyes darting between her and the motionless King.

It didn't move. It just watched.

Surrounding the King, the platform—splintered and broken from the earlier battle—began to mend, the cracks reversing, healing as if time itself was being rewritten.

Yet Celestina couldn't tear her focus from the King.

Her grip tightened around her sword, knuckles white.

She gritted her teeth, the weight of her own heartbeat crashing in her ears.

"What else can we do?" Another hissed, barely audible.

"We take its damn head."

Vergil, standing beside her, seemed almost unfazed, his eyes fixed on the looming figure.

"Don't overreact. Scary as the king in knights armor looks, the instructors won't let us die... probably," he muttered, though the attempt at reassurance did little to calm anyone.

"Cadet Vergil is right, we need to—"

""...!""

Her words caught in her throat as a collective gasp rippled through the group.

The Dark King moved.

The chains binding it groaned, metal twisting, then shattering with a deafening clang as it rose from its obsidian throne.

The broken links slithered down to its feet like discarded serpents.

They were never meant to hold it.

They were meant to deceive.

It loomed over them, towering nearly two meters tall, its presence suffocating, oppressive.

Those blood-red eyes never once left hers.

Celestina stood frozen, her body unwilling to move, to breathe.

She had faced its clones before, but this... this was different.

The clones were mere shadows, weak imitations.

They didn't possess mana cores, their strength barely scraping the surface of what a true Grade 2 monster could do.

But this...

This was no imitation.

This was the Dark King.

The real one.

And it was standing before her.

Step—!

Its first step sent cracks splintering through the ground.

Step—!

Each footfall resonated with her heartbeat, the rhythm tightening in her chest.

Step—!

It was as if the floor itself trembled at its approach.

Step—!

'Why... why is it so different from all the others?'

Her thoughts spiraled, panic creeping in.

She had faced monsters before—monsters that clawed and snarled, that devoured their prey with mindless savagery.

But this... this was unlike anything she had ever encountered.

The Dark King was deliberate.

Methodical.

And utterly terrifying.

Step—!

The Dark King's image warped before Celestina's eyes, twisting and overlapping with something—a figure from a nightmarish past.

Blood flowed from its body like a grotesque waterfall, staining the air with a sickening red mist. Its eyes were hollow, empty sockets that seemed to drain the light around them.

A toothless grin spread across a gaunt face that belonged to someone who had been dead for over seven years.

Her vision wavered, the spectral figure blurring with the Dark King's form, sending icy shivers through her spine.

Her heart raced, her breath came in ragged gasps.

She felt a rush of panic, her mind screaming in desperation.

'No! What am I doing...!'

She forced herself to focus, shaking her head violently as if to clear the horrific image.

The Dark King's form solidified again in her vision, its malevolent advance menacing.

'Didn't I swear to obliterate the entire void realm? How can I be paralyzed by something so insignificant now!?'

The shame clawed at her, a gnawing reminder of the promise she had made—not just to herself but one she told Azriel as well, who even admired her.

To falter now, to show fear in the face of such a creature...

'I will destroy it... I will destroy it all.'

"Celestina, I am—"

"No."

Lumine's voice was cut off by her icy refusal, leaving him and the others stunned.

Her voice, usually warm and reassuring, was now a chilling command.

"It wants only me... stay out of it."

"What?"

Lumine's eyes widened in confusion, his voice barely a whisper.

"Oi Princess, what are you—"

Vergil's protest was swallowed by the shock of what happened next.

Under the bewildered stares of her comrades, Celestina surged forward, her movements a blur.

"Huh, Celestina!?"

"What the hell!?"

"Haha! The princess has lost her mind!"

Ignoring the shouts and gasps behind her, Celestina closed the distance between herself and the Dark King.

*****

"I've never seen her like that before."

Azriel nodded as Jasmine's whispered words reached his ears.

'It seems it's finally stopped eyeing me like a creep… though I'm not sure how to feel about it targeting Celestina now…'

She clearly wasn't handling it well. Something had shifted.

The dark king's sudden movement had stunned them all, but the real shock came from Celestina herself.

Her cold, cutting voice surprised even Azriel as she ordered the others to stay back as she went to fight alone.

'Is it because of…'

"Instructors, what's going to happen after this?"

Jasmine's voice broke through, directing Azriel's attention to the instructors.

Azriel followed her gaze.

The instructors looked at the two of them, then at Celestina, and back again.

"...Everything will proceed as usual."

Instructor Kevin smiled slightly as he spoke, causing Jasmine to narrow her eyes.

"Even with the sudden floor shift? It's abnormal. How do we know it didn't happen on the other floors as well?"

Her words carried weight.

She knew that the void dungeon seemed to have an unsettling focus on her little brother, though she couldn't disclose that detail.

The void dungeon had always been unpredictable, but this was different.

"Even if other floors had experienced a shift, what difference does it make? The fact remains that they were scheduled to face a Grade 2 monster on the third floor anyway. This year's batch is exceptional—far more talented than previous ones. This floor shift could actually be seen as an blessing for them.

It's almost as if the void dungeon itself recognizes their skill and is upping the ante, perhaps considering the challenge insufficient for their capabilities."

Jasmine's lips pursed as she considered his words.

The objective was to reach the fifth floor, and encountering a dangerous floor shift seemed almost implausible.

Yet, in this unpredictable age, avoiding slight increases in risk would lead nowher

"Aren't you going to fight, Cadet Azriel?"

An instructor's question pulled Azriel from his thoughts. He looked at the instructor, his face unreadable for a few seconds.

'Instructor Alicia...'

A smile spread across his face.

"Unfortunately, the void dungeon would need another floor shift to make it a challenge if I were to step in now."

"..."

"..."

"Pfft! Haha! That's brilliant! I like your confidence, Cadet Azriel!"

Instructor Alicia laughed, holding her stomach and wiping tears from her eyes. Instructor Kevin and Benson looked at him, stunned and surprised.

"You shouldn't underestimate the void dungeon, Cadet Azriel. Even if it isn't the void realm, unforeseen things can happen here," Instructor Kevin warned.

Azriel nodded.

"Refrain from speaking any further, Instructor Kevin. Instructor Alicia."

Instructor Benson scowled as the two instructors grinned at him.

"Jeez, Ben, you really need to loosen up! It's not like we're helping them or anything. If Cadet Azriel doesn't care about his points and decides to sit this one out, why can't we enjoy the moment?"

Instructor Alicia said, wrapping her arm around Instructor Benson's shoulder.

Instructor Kevin nodded in agreement.

"They certainly are... close."

"Mm, they really are."

Azriel nodded as Jasmine whispered again. They were indeed close.

Bam!

A loud crash jolted them from their banter. Azriel and the others turned toward the sound of something being destroyed.

The fight between Celestina and the dark king was heating up.

Chapter 79: The Dark King of Imperion [6]

Celestina's blade clanged violently against the Dark King's obsidian armor, the sound of metal on metal ringing in her ears.

The impact sent a shockwave through her arms, reverberating down to her bones.

Her muscles screamed in protest as the sword barely scratched the surface, sliding off with a high-pitched whine.

A thin fracture appeared, but it was nowhere near enough.

She gritted her teeth, stumbling back as the Dark King's arm shot out, extending with unnatural speed.

The wind from his sweeping strike brushed her face, but she narrowly evaded it, rolling to her feet.

"This armor… It's like trying to carve through a mountain."

Her thoughts raced.

"I need to use more power. My whole body has to be in every strike."

Her legs coiled beneath her, ready to spring again, but before she could act, the ground in front of her exploded.

Dust and debris flew in all directions as the Dark King surged forward, a massive fist tearing through the air toward her face.

Her eyes widened, breath caught in her throat.

Time seemed to slow.

The fist loomed closer, its speed deafening as the air wailed under its force.

In the split second before impact, she twisted her body to the left, feeling the wind of his punch brush past her cheek.

With a sharp cry, she thrust her sword toward his chest.

Sparks erupted as her blade met the Dark King's forearm, blocking the attack with chilling ease.

Shards of his armor scattered like broken glass, yet the king remained unphased.

His crimson eyes, glowing with malice, locked onto hers, unblinking and cold.

Celestina retreated once more, heart pounding, as three glowing white orbs like the suns formed around her, humming with raw energy.

Without hesitation, they shot toward the Dark King, tearing through the air like falling stars.

The Dark King lunged, his massive frame a blur of shadow and speed.

The ground beneath him erupted as two of the orbs missed, crashing into the ground and detonating in blinding white fire.

But the third—he couldn't avoid it.

It shot toward his face, a bullet of pure energy.

The onlooking cadets gasped, hearts in their throats as they watched.

The orb neared, mere inches from the Dark King's helm…

But then, impossibly, the Dark King vanished, the ground swallowing him in a swirling black vortex.

Every instinct screamed at her.

Celestina spun just as another black hole opened behind her, the Dark King emerging with deadly precision.

His fist, blackened and monstrous, shot toward her again.

She was faster.

In a flash of light, she stepped forward, disappearing an instant before the fist could connect.

She reappeared several meters away, glowing orbs whirling around her once more.

Her breath came in ragged bursts, but her eyes remained locked on her enemy.

Feathered wings of pure white light unfurled from her back, lifting her from the ground.

She ascended, glowing like a celestial being.

"I knew it. It has the power of shadows… A rare affinity."

Below her, the Dark King's own wings burst forth—great, leathery bat-like appendages that unfurled in blackness.

He rose to meet her, his crimson gaze burning with cold fury.

She clenched her fists around her sword's hilt.

She didn't need Lumine, Azriel or anyone else.

This was hers to win.

No leader would let someone else take down the first-floor boss for them.

She had to show them.

With a powerful flap of her wings, Celestina surged toward the Dark King, her eyes locked onto her target.

He moved to meet her, wings of shadow cutting through the air with an ominous rush.

Their forms blurred as they hurtled toward each other.

She swung her sword in a wide arc, expecting to meet his armor—but the instant her blade made contact, her body jolted. It wasn't the unyielding metal of his armor.

No, this was something else.

Her eyes widened in shock as she glanced down.

Before her, an onyx halberd, darker than the void itself, had intercepted her strike.

The black blade gleamed like a void that devoured light, its surface impossibly smooth, as if it had been painted with the night itself.

It was the Dark King's weapon.

With a fluid motion that belied his size, the Dark King twirled the halberd, the weapon slicing through the air with a deafening howl.

The force of his spin seemed to warp the space around them, the air trembling.

Celestina's heart raced, but she refused to falter.

Her grip tightened on her sword, and in the blink of an eye, she raised it in defense.

The Dark King's strike came down with terrifying precision, aiming to cleave her in two.

Steel met steel with a resounding crash.

The impact tore through her body, sending a violent shockwave from her arms down to her core.

Her muscles screamed under the strain as the force rattled her bones, but she held.

Gritting her teeth, she locked her gaze with his, refusing to give an inch.

The air around them trembled as they hung in the air.

Celestina swayed, her wings beating rhythmically as she steadied herself.

Her movements were graceful, almost delicate, despite the battle raging around her.

The weightless feeling of floating in the air contrasted with the raw violence of their clash.

Then, with a burst of speed, she spun, her sword cutting through the air like a silver streak.

Her body moved with the elegance of a dancer, twirling through the void with a deadly beauty.

She retaliated, her blade striking with precision, each movement fluid, controlled.

Their weapons clashed again, the sound ringing out like the toll of a great bell, reverberating through the vast floor.

Every cadet watching below held their breath, eyes wide, hearts pounding, as the air between the two seemed to crackle with tension.

Celestina fell back, using three glowing orbs that orbited her.

With a decisive gesture, she sent them hurtling toward the Dark King.

They streaked through the air with blinding speed, their paths converging on their target.

The Dark King remained eerily calm as the orbs approached.

The air crackled with raw energy, and the orbs seemed to blur the space around them.

Just before impact, a surge of shadow erupted around the Dark King, forming an impenetrable shell that absorbed the explosive force of the orbs.

The white-hot blasts and searing heat were absorbed by the darkness, leaving the Dark King unharmed.

When the protective shell dissipated, Celestina was no longer in sight.

For the first time, a flicker of uncertainty flashed in the Dark King's eyes as it spun around, searching the empty air.

Panic—however slight—betrayed its otherwise unshakable demeanor.

But Celestina was already upon it.

Suddenly with a thunderous clash, her sword collided with the Dark King's halberd.

The force of the impact caught the Dark King off-guard, sending it sprawling to the ground.

Dust exploded outward, enveloping the battlefield in a choking cloud.

Celestina landed lightly, her wings vanishing as she touched down.

The weight of the battle was beginning to take its toll—her mana reserves were dangerously low.

The battle with the clones had drained her considerably.

Though she had recovered more than half of her mana, the recent fight had exhausted almost everything she had left.

As the dust settled, the Dark King was revealed, kneeling and staring at Celestina amidst the shattered ground and debris.

Its eyes were unreadable, but that didn't matter to her. All she needed to do now was finish this.

With her sword firmly in hand, Celestina approached the Dark King cautiously.

It made no move to defend itself, simply watching her.

Its halberd lay a few meters away, lodged in the ground.

A sudden thought sent a shiver down Celestina's spine.

What if the Dark King was stronger?

A more powerful void creature—perhaps a demon, abyssal, or even a monarch.

Such a being would undoubtedly bring devastation.

Yet, another question gnawed at her—why was this creature only classified as a grade 2 monster, or even a grade 1 beast before that?

Why was it here in this void dungeon?

What was this void dungeon, anyway?

How did it keep creating these void creatures, and how real were they?

As she stood before the Dark King, she pushed these thoughts aside.

Now was not the time for doubts.

The Dark King looked up at her, its expression unreadable.

It did not resist, did not fight back.

The battle had felt simultaneously grueling and strangely effortless.

Her skin bore only a few scratches, despite the intensity of the fight.

Why...?

Did it perhaps...

"Enough thinking. Not now."

Celestina's teeth clenched, and she shook off the lingering doubts.

She raised her sword high, her grip steady.

"...a king in knight's armor."

She couldn't understand why it was called the Dark King.

Was it because of the throne?

The Obsidian Throne, which, ironically, had remained unscathed.

It sat untouched in the center, not a single scratch marring its surface.

"...."

Celestina swung her sword down.

With a silent slash, the head of the Dark King fell, the metal clattering as it hit the ground.

The entire body then disintegrated into white dust particles.

The entire floor was silent.

A single, beautifully shining mana core was in front of her feet.

Yet she didn't feel any joy.

She was frozen—paralyzed by the final look the Dark King had given her.

Chapter 80: Second Floor [1]

Azriel watched in silence, standing with Jasmine and the instructors as they observed Celestina on the platform. She stood tall, gazing down at the mana core lying at her feet.

The same couldn't be said for the cadets.

The cadets erupted into cheers, celebrating Celestina's victory over the floor boss.

Even Lumine, Vergil, Yelena, and the three other cadets who helped were visibly elated.

It was an incredible feat Celestina had pulled off.

The cadets rushed to her side.

"You're not going to join them?"

Jasmine asked, her voice soft.

Azriel smiled at her question.

"Me? The one who contributed nothing on this floor, and when the leader personally asked for my help, I sent someone else in my place? Do I dare celebrate with them now?"

"If you put it that way…"

"My reputation as the delinquent prince would skyrocket."

A chuckle escaped his lips as he watched Celestina, overwhelmed by the crowd.

Her perfect image, cracking ever so slightly, was strangely satisfying to witness.

'This is... quite amusing.'

In the book, it had been Lumine, not Celestina, who defeated the floor boss.

Lumine had led the cadets, though not all had followed him.

Some hadn't believed he was worthy of being their apex.

But now, with Azriel as the apex stepping aside to give the role of leadership to the Frost Clan's princess, there were no objections.

They trusted her.

Now more than ever.

The image of their leader—a princess from one of the Four Great Clans, ranked third among the academy's first years—leading them through the first floor without harm and defeating the original Dark King on her own was seared into their minds.

Celestina had made it look so easy.

As for Lumine... Azriel couldn't say much.

Back then, Lumine hadn't been forced to use his full abilities since the Dark King had only been a Grade 1 beast, not a Grade 2 monster like now.

His fire alone had been enough to burn it, but this time was different.

But what Lumine did have this time was Vergil, who had helped keep him from revealing his other affinities.

Even if Neo Genesis were to attack now, Azriel doubted the outcome would be the same as last time.

Not with how organized the cadets had become, and certainly not with Azriel here.

And then there was the Void Dungeon—relentlessly complicating his life.

Had the cadets split up, things might have turned ugly, but they hadn't.

Azriel doubted the Void Dungeon would throw anything at him with serious consequences, not while they were still on the lower floors.

A sigh escaped his lips as he silently began walking forward, Jasmine and the instructors' curious gazes following him.

Jasmine trailed after him as they passed the celebrating cadets, who were laughing and singing without noticing the two slipping by.

Azriel stopped in front of the obsidian throne at the center of the platform, Jasmine by his side.

The throne was flawless—untouched by time.

No dust, no scratches, no marks.

As if in response to the throne, the platform around them began to repair itself.

Azriel stepped closer, his fingers brushing the black surface.

His reflection stared back at him.

He licked his dry lips, circling the throne.

"Why do you think it was called the Dark King and not the Dark Knight?"

Jasmine tilted her head, considering his question.

"...Because of the throne, right? It was chained to it, as if belonging to it. I don't know why it wore knight's armor, but it definitely seemed like a king."

Azriel smiled softly, standing in front of the throne, his back to her.

"I don't think he was ever a king."

Jasmine's brows furrowed.

"What do you mean?"

"The title of Dark King was wrong."

"Why do you say that...?"

Azriel crouched, picking up the broken chains from the floor.

They hadn't repaired like the rest, nor had they vanished into white dust like the Dark King.

They remained, alone—just like the throne.

"Sister, the Dark King will reappear here, right? Waiting for the next group to challenge it?"

Azriel's question took Jasmine by surprise.

She nodded.

"That's right. It usually takes a day, maybe more or less, for the floor boss to respawn. After that, the gates will close, and everything will return to how it was before."

Azriel's voice softened.

"Its king vanished, its world crumbled, and now it is condemned to sit, chained to this hollow throne, left to rot in the depths of its own misery for the rest of its wretched existence."

"...."

Jasmine stared at him, stunned.

"Have you finally lost it? What are you even talking about...?"

She looked at him with concern, as though he had gone mad.

Azriel chuckled softly.

"I read it once in a book."

He dropped the chains, standing up before walking back to Jasmine.

Curiosity flickered in her eyes.

"What kind of book?"

"It was about a knight—loyal to his king—during a war against the creatures of the night. One night, the creatures invaded the kingdom, slaughtering men, women, and children without mercy. The knight rushed to the throne room, only to find his king had vanished, while the kingdom burned around him."

"...Oh."

Jasmine was unsure what to say.

It was an interesting story, but she didn't quite understand its relevance.

Azriel continued.

"When the creatures reached the throne room, they found only the knight. To mock his loyalty, they chained him to the throne, burned his flesh, and left him there forever. The kingdom was destroyed, the humans perished, and the knight's king abandoned him. All that was left for him was to sit there... alone."

Jasmine blinked, absorbing Azriel's words before glancing at the throne.

"That... is incredibly sad."

Azriel laughed lightly at her response. She genuinely seemed to pity the knight.

He patted her head gently before moving back toward the instructors.

"It is, but it was just a story I read. It has nothing to do with the so-called Dark King."

"...Right."

*****

Celestina struggled to maintain control over the excited crowd of cadets celebrating her victory.

They cheered, laughing and shouting, caught up in the moment.

With a small nod, she excused herself and bent to pick up the mana core, fully intending to consume it.

No one objected.

A hush fell over the cadets as they watched her in silent awe, their excitement replaced by anticipation.

She was about to absorb the mana core of a Grade 2 monster—one that had been the floor boss.

As she glanced at their eager faces, a sense of satisfaction washed over her.

But something still felt... off.

'Oh... right.'

Realizing what it was, Celestina turned her head slightly, her gaze traveling farther back.

There, standing with the instructors on the platform, were Azriel and Jasmine.

They watched from a distance, separated from the crowd.

Azriel smiled at her but didn't approach.

She noticed a few cadets casting unfriendly glances in his direction.

It was clear many still didn't think highly of him.

Some even shot him looks that implied they'd rather he stayed with the instructors and Jasmine—who hadn't contributed to the fight.

'...As if they did any better'

If it hadn't been for Azriel helping her, with Vergil joining them, things could have gone much worse.

Everything had worked out smoothly, but she knew it wasn't just her doing.

She owed Azriel as well.

It annoyed her how the others secretly looked down on him, but neither Azriel nor Jasmine seemed to care or even notice.

'Right. They're used to it by now.'

Before his disappearance and supposed death, Azriel had been one of the main daily topics of the world—always involved in some scandal or rumor that tarnished his reputation.

Yet he had never cared.

Why would he now?

At previous banquets, some had even had the audacity to gossip about him in front of Jasmine.

Undoubtedly, that must have been unpleasant for her.

But Azriel always remained unbothered.

Celestina made up her mind to thank him, even if he hadn't done much in the fight.

He had still helped, no matter how little.

Besides, she wanted to tell him personally that she had defeated the Dark King.

After all, it was Azriel who had trusted her with the role of leadership from the start.

But before she could reach him, everything changed in an instant.

The platform beneath them began to tremble.

The sound of chains rattling and grinding against each other echoed from below.

Confusion crossed Celestina's face, mirrored by the cadets around her.

But not everyone looked confused.

The trembling intensified, nearly throwing them all off balance.

Falling off the edge would mean plummeting into whatever lay beneath the platform.

Suddenly, the sound of chains snapping filled the air.

And then, without warning—

"...!"

The platform collapsed.

Celestina's heart dropped to her stomach.

She clutched the mana core tightly as the world around her plunged into darkness.

A blinding light shot from beneath the platform, and as quickly as it had begun, the fall ended.

Celestina blinked, her breath catching as she found herself standing once more.

The platform had stopped shaking, as if nothing had happened.

But something was different.

The obsidian throne was gone.

In its place stood a slightly elevated small circular platform.

They weren't on the first floor anymore.

It didn't take a genius to realize where they were.

'The second floor...'

Chapter 81: Second Floor [2]

Azriel found himself with the others standing on the edge of a tall cliff that seemed to stretch endlessly in both directions.

Below them, a desolate expanse of land sprawled out, a wasteland that gave the illusion of a dried-up ocean—though it was far from any natural desert.

The drop from the cliff had to be at least a hundred meters, if not more, and the jagged rocks that dotted the bottom made his stomach churn at the thought of falling.

Gazing down, Azriel let out a shaky breath and kneeled to steady himself, his fingers brushing the cold, stone edge of the cliff.

He squinted, trying to make sense of the sight below.

Was his mind playing tricks on him?

No matter how long he stared, the ground looked like a graveyard from some ancient nightmare.

Massive, misshapen black rocks jutted out of the earth in eerie, twisted forms.

Some were sharp like spears, others were oddly rounded or jagged, but none of them resembled anything he'd ever seen.

It was as though the land itself had contorted under some unseen pressure, warping into an alien landscape.

As his eyes wandered over the scene, his breath caught in his throat. Sticking out between the rocks, like grim monuments, were bones.

Towering bones.

Some reached as high as the rocks themselves, and others loomed even taller, dwarfing everything else in sight.

Their pale surfaces gleamed with an unnatural glow, contrasting sharply against the black sand that covered the ground.

Massive, ancient bones, long abandoned to this desolate place, yet the sheer size of them sent a chill down his spine.

What sort of creatures had once walked this land?

He couldn't even fathom the kind of creatures these remains had belonged to.

Giants, perhaps.

Or something worse, something more terrifying than his mind could comprehend.

The black sand that blanketed the ground beneath the bones shimmered faintly under the sky's eerie light.

It wasn't just any sand—it was like grains of darkness itself, fine and cold, absorbing the faint illumination from above. It glittered in a way that seemed unnatural.

He stood and looked up, trying to shake off the unsettling feeling. The sky above was just as strange as the land beneath his feet.

It was dark, pitch-black, with no sign of a sun or moon, yet it wasn't completely devoid of light.

Stars dotted the sky, or at least, he assumed they were stars.

At first glance, they appeared like any ordinary starry night, pinpricks of light scattered across the vast black canvas.

But something was off.

Some of the stars seemed to flicker, blinking on and off in a pattern that made his skin crawl.

"Just what the hell is up there...?"

It didn't make sense to Azriel.

The massive black hole known as the Gate of the Void Dungeon back in CASC looked like it had swallowed them, as if bringing them to the first floor, which one would think to be underground.

But if that were the case, then why would Azriel see a sky and stars, or whatever it was, above him?

What and where is the Void Dungeon exactly?

How did any of this make sense?

Perhaps it was better if he didn't find out.

A gust of wind swept across the cliff, carrying with it the faint sound of something moving far below.

It was subtle, like the shifting of sand or the distant scraping of bones against rock, but it was there.

Azriel stiffened, his gaze snapping back to the wasteland below.

Nothing seemed to move, but the eerie quiet that followed only made him more tense.

"Dammit, what were the gods thinking when they built this floor... if it was even them," Azriel muttered, his voice barely audible.

He had no idea.

"Hoo..."

His breath trembled slightly as he walked toward Jasmine, who was glancing around like the sight wasn't all that impressive.

Noticing his approach, she turned to him and smiled.

"The difference between the first and second floor is huge, isn't it?"

Azriel nodded slowly, a troubled expression clouding his face as he glanced at the surroundings.

"Yeah... it really is."

Though he had read about it, seeing the second floor was something else entirely.

It felt overwhelming.

And he wasn't the only one.

All the cadets stood there, lost in thought, swallowed by the sight before them.

Azriel slumped onto the rocky ground, closing his eyes as he let out another sigh.

"Something wrong? You look exhausted."

Jasmine crouched down, her face close to his.

There was no way Azriel could be exhausted; he had barely done anything aside from wiping out the horde of prowlers on the first floor.

He turned his head slightly, avoiding her gaze.

This only piqued Jasmine's curiosity, and she leaned in even closer, making sure no one was looking.

"Azriel? Tell me what's bothering you."

"Nothing," he said instantly, his lips tightening into a thin line.

Jasmine narrowed her eyes.

"Liar."

"How can you know if I'm lying? Are you some kind of mind reader? Where's your trust in your little brother? You're supposed to trust family, right?"

"My trust in you is about as strong as the number of leviathans I've killed this week, which, by the way, is zero."

Azriel clicked his tongue at her blunt response, refusing to meet her eyes as she continued to stare at him.

'Am I really losing my touch?'

How else would she know he was lying?

A sigh escaped his lips once more, and he still didn't look her in the face.

"Did I ever tell you that I am..."

"You are...?"

Azriel clenched his fist, his voice barely audible as he whispered.

"...scared of heights."

"...."

There was silence.

He didn't dare look at her, though he could feel her gaze burning into the side of his face.

"Khhk..."

A strange sound came from beside him, making Azriel furrow his brows as he glanced over at Jasmine, her head now lowered.

"Nghk..."

"Sister...?" he asked, worried by the strange noise.

He moved closer to her.

And then...

"Hahaha! I can't... I can't! Seriously... you, of all people, are af-mnghf!"

"Shut up, idiot...!"

Azriel hissed, clamping his hand over her mouth as muffled laughter shook her body, tickling his palm.

His ears burned as he felt her shaking beneath his touch.

Jasmine's laughter had drawn the attention of a few cadets, and Azriel had no way of explaining the situation to them.

'Seriously, this is why I didn't want to tell her!'

The Azriel Crimson, scared of heights.

Surviving the Void Realm.

Surviving Europe.

Challenging Caleus.

Becoming the apex.

Bold enough to sideline himself on the first floor.

But scared of heights?

One of his darkest secrets, and now he regretted sharing it with his sister, this mere human being.

After a minute, she finally began to calm down.

Azriel cautiously released his hand.

"You going to behave?"

She nodded, though he noticed the amusement still dancing in her eyes.

His expression darkened.

Jasmine took a deep breath, a smile still on her face.

"Stop smiling," Azriel grumbled.

"There's nothing funny about this."

"Yes... yes, it's definitely not funny," Jasmine said, trying to suppress her smile, though she seemed to be struggling not to laugh further.

Azriel's glare deepened, his mood darkening even more as he noticed her attempt to hold back her laughter.

"Want me to comfort you?"

Azriel's face darkened even further at her words.

"Or hold your hand?"

"...."

"I could also give you a lap pillow again if you want. Your sleeping face is so cute and defenseless!"

"...."

"Oh, should I carry you instead while you close your eyes? Piggyback or princess style—just name it. I'm pretty strong, you know."

Azriel's face was so stormy that it sent a shiver down the spines of the nearby cadets, who quickly looked away, unwilling to meet his gaze.

"...Jasmine."

Jasmine stiffened at the mention of her name.

"Y-yes?"

"Don't you think it would be tragic if the heiress of the Crimson Clan were to suddenly die on the second floor, leaving all those responsibilities to your poor little brother?"

His voice was cold, making Jasmine break out in a cold sweat as she nodded vigorously.

"Yes... tragic. It would be very tragic."

"It seems we're on the same page then," Azriel said with a chilling smile.

"Let's make sure you stay the heiress, okay?"

An awkward laugh escaped Jasmine's lips as she felt a shiver run down her spine at the sudden brightness of Azriel's smile.

She wasn't scared or anything by his words and behaviour.

Definitely not.

"J-jokes aside, my dearest little brother, whom I care so much about, that fear of yours is going to be quite troublesome."

Azriel looked at her with a troubled expression, already sensing what was coming.

"…How so?"

Jasmine looked at the edge of the cliff, where most of the cadets were standing or seated with frightened expressions, no doubt already understanding what they would have to do

"Well, to reach the third floor, we're going to have to... descend the cliff."

Chapter 82: Second Floor [3]

Azriel knew this moment was inevitable.

He knew it, but knowing didn't make it any easier.

This would likely be one of the most hated moments of his life as he stared at the edge of the cliff, jaw clenched.

If only Solomon hadn't walked in that day when he was alone in his room.

He might have tested how high he could jump without dying.

"Always ruining my mood, no matter where that stupid clown is..."

Yes.

Azriel blamed Solomon.

His fists tightened, then loosened, over and over as he tried to steady his breathing, calming himself little by little.

His face grew unreadable.

It wasn't ideal to let anyone see his distress, not right now.

Well, except for one person who already knew...

...and seemed to enjoy it.

"The gods really are cruel..."

He then glanced at Celestina, standing with some cadets—Lumine and Yelena—deep in discussion about their next move.

The second floor was nothing like the first.

It wasn't a maze that felt like walking through mirrors.

There would be no lucky floor shifts to help them this time.

Azriel approached, his presence halting their conversation as they turned to face him.

A wry smile crept onto Azriel's face as he stopped in front of them.

There were faces he didn't recognize, but a few he did, like Cadet Kanae.

It seemed Celestina had decided to take others' advice before making any further moves on this floor.

"So... what's the plan?"

Azriel asked, his eyes locking onto Celestina, who returned his gaze with a blank expression.

"The plan? Are you asking because you're finally going to help?"

Lumine, standing beside Celestina, narrowed his eyes at Azriel.

'Hmm? Is he angry at me...?'

Azriel sensed a trace of irritation in Lumine's voice.

'Ah, right,'

it clicked.

'He's nervous.'

No doubt it was because of the quest he'd received from the system.

Lumine must have been on edge this entire time.

'I wonder if he still has the same quest...'

Azriel sighed, meeting Lumine's eyes.

"Do you need my help?"

Lumine furrowed his brow at the question.

"Of course we do."

"For what?"

Lumine hesitated, momentarily lost for words.

For what, exactly?

Azriel already knew.

Lumine wanted reassurance—Azriel's help would ease his mind, knowing the other cadets would be safer during the void dungeon.

But even without the quest, Lumine cared deeply for the others.

His mind just wasn't focused right now, too distracted by suspicion and doubt.

'How mean of me...'

Azriel thought, watching Lumine struggle to speak.

"That... you know, killing void creatures."

Azriel raised an eyebrow.

"You need my help for that? I'm a greedy person, you know. If I stick around, I'll just be held back, and I'm not interested in splitting mana cores this time."

Not that it was even possible.

His skill, [Core Reaper], ensured that the moment he killed a void creature, he absorbed the mana cores instantly—no need to extract them from their bodies.

No one else knew about this, just as they hadn't known it was Azriel who was responsible for the empty mana cores on the first floor.

It was a ridiculous skill, on par with an [Unique Skill], much like his [Void Mind].

But neither were his true [Unique Skill].

Azriel had something far more special.

"If I were to help, it'd make things too easy. Some would try to use me as their personal mana core supplier while doing nothing. People can die here, with or without my help. It'll either make them stronger if they survive, or pathetic if they don't because they hid behind me or you."

Lumine fell silent, knowing Azriel was right.

The gap between Azriel and the other first years wasn't small.

The same could be said for Lumine, whose strength was becoming more apparent to the others.

Slowly, some had begun to rely on him, treating him as another potential leader—someone to use for gaining mana cores.

Of course, those same cadets wouldn't act until they were confident or had enough support, which wasn't coming anytime soon, especially after Celestina's performance against the Dark King.

Azriel turned his attention to the group before returning his gaze to Celestina, who still wore an unreadable expression.

"So, am I allowed to know what plan you've come up with?"

After a moment, Celestina nodded.

"Of course. We were planning to share it with the others later."

She stepped toward the cliff's edge, overlooking the black desert.

Azriel hesitated for a second, then followed her, standing at her side.

The others watched them in silence before eventually leaving.

"It's quite high, isn't it?"

"...It is."

Of course, it was high—and Azriel was terrified of heights.

Not that Celestina knew, nor did he plan to let anyone else find out.

Jasmine had been an exception, one he regretted.

"They say the black desert shouldn't be on the second floor... it's too unbalanced for such an early floor."

Azriel pressed his lips together.

"Whoever designed this dungeon clearly wasn't sober."

Celestina smiled faintly.

"Yes, definitely drunk."

The void dungeon was a place of chaotic phenomena—floor shifts, unbalanced challenges, and inexplicable dangers.

It was confusing and complex, a place where anyone could die at any moment.

The deeper you went, the more certain that death became.

"We're planning to send a scout down first to map out what we're dealing with."

Azriel's eyes opened slightly.

"And who's the scout?"

It was a dangerous task—whoever went would be descending into the unknown, risking death.

"Me," Celestina said.

"Since I proposed the plan and I'm the leader, it only makes sense. But Lumine's been strangely insistent that he should go instead."

Azriel nodded, understanding. Lumine's reasons might have been different, but as the second-ranked first-year, he was the best choice.

"So, is he going down now?"

Celestina shook her head.

"No. Then Yelena offered, saying she was better suited for the task. We've been arguing about it ever since, until you showed up."

Azriel nodded again.

Yelena was another excellent choice—few could match her instincts and senses among the first years.

"Haa... at least no one wants to go back yet."

Celestina sounded exhausted as they both stared down at the black desert.

Occasionally, the wind rustled.

If someone wanted to leave, they could.

The slightly elevated platform where the Dark King's throne had been housed a small black hole now.

Stepping into it would send them back outside the throne room's gate, though they'd have to find their way out of the dungeon afterward.

Azriel stood silently beside her, knowing he wasn't the only one scared.

Anyone would be, standing this high up, knowing they'd have to descend into danger soon enough.

After a few moments, Azriel broke the silence.

"...I'll go."

"Huh..."

Celestina snapped her head toward him.

"What... no, but why?"

"Consider it my way of thanking you for letting me tag along without doing anything on the first floor."

Celestina blinked, then shook her head.

"No, but a lot of others didn't do much either. There was barely anything for most of us to do."

She was right.

Traveling with a group of cadets meant not everyone got their fair share of action.

Still, Azriel shook his head.

"They followed you with the intent of doing whatever you said. I didn't. I'm still not, by the way. So consider this my payment for letting me follow you around without doing much on this floor as well."

Celestina pursed her lips before speaking.

"Fine. I accept your proposal. I'll tell the others, and you'll leave tomorr—"

"No."

Azriel cut her off, and she looked at him in surprise.

"You and the others who fought the dark king are still tired and haven't recovered your mana. Rest here while I go now. It'll only take a day, enough time for everyone to recover."

"But—"

"It's fine. I'm doing this on my own volition. Oh, and tell my dear sister that if she follows me, I'll tell Mom about her special collection."

Celestina looked puzzled, trying to process his words.

"Special collection? What collection?"

Azriel smirked.

"You can ask her that."

"...make sure you don't die and run if needed."

There was no point in dying a foolish death.

Azriel nodded his head.

He was probably one of the fastest here, so escaping was something he could definitely, and would definitely, do if the need arose.

"I will, thanks. Now go and get some sleep. Tell the same to Lumine and Yelena."

He would have said to tell the same to Vergil, but the guy was already asleep right next to the slightly elevated platform.
