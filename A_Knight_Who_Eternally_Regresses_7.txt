Shhhk!
The well-sharpened blade cut through the soldier’s neck. The fight continued. Another battle. Another repeated today. He fought and died again. But Enkrid fought fiercely. He grasped the trick the moment he heard it.
Instead of facing boldly, he had to desperately struggle to survive. That was crucial. Ultimately, he couldn’t avoid death.
But that was fine. He would get what he wanted anyway. Of course, he still had tasks to accomplish.
‘The flagpoles.’
The goal was to attack the flagpoles, the medium of sorcery. Enkrid overlaid his real combat with this objective. He charged toward the goal. Through the repeated todays, he had learned the enemy's movements in advance.
Trusting the fog, the enemy soldiers were caught off guard by a single attack. Enkrid made full use of this.
Chapter 40: The Flags Flutter, and the Soldiers Dance with Swords (3)
Every day, Enkrid learned the Focus Point technique from Ragna and then charged into real combat. That was Enkrid's repeated today.
There were countless repetitions. Even as he faced death repeatedly, the Focus Point technique seemed just out of reach.
‘Don’t rush’, he told himself.
He shifted his thoughts. First, he would try breaking the flagpole.
When the battle began again, Enkrid pondered how to minimize damage. Thinking and strategizing were among his specialties.
The fog descended again. The Fog of Annihilation. Though Enkrid didn’t know the name of this sorcery, he knew he couldn't succumb to it. Before the fog could fully envelop them and before Rem could shout anything, Enkrid spoke up.
“Everyone, get down!”
They were caught off guard. Even the squad leader ducked at the sudden command.
“Shields up!”
As Enkrid shouted again, his allies reflexively raised their shields. Feeling his left hand empty, Enkrid picked up a shield as well.
Lowering his stance and holding the shield diagonally, he charged forward. Several bolts and arrows thudded against his shield.
The oil-soaked shield did its job well.
‘I should have brought a shield sooner.’
There had been times when he had charged in only to be struck by a bolt or arrow before the fight even started. This had made him adept at dodging while closing the distance.
With these thoughts, he charged forward. From past experience, he knew that to escape the fog’s influence, he had to get close to the enemy.
Enkrid did just that.
As he ran, he suddenly pushed off the ground and threw himself to the left.
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Spears slashed through the air where he had been. He had memorized the pattern. Creating a life-threatening situation wouldn’t help him achieve the Focus Point. He had to struggle desperately.
Enkrid resolved to do just that. Dodging the spear, he rushed right up to the enemy.
Finally, he saw the enemy beyond the fog. The surprised face inside a rounded leather helmet was visible. Enkrid kicked the ankle of the startled enemy.
“Ugh!”
As the soldier lost balance and fell, Enkrid struck his head with the edge of his shield.
Crack!
It sounded like wood splitting. If the soldier survived, it would be pure luck. Passing by the fallen soldier, Enkrid drew his longsword. As he swung it widely, the three or four enemies who had been closing in were startled. Enkrid quickly mapped out his path in his mind.
He had repeated today over 300 times. He could navigate with his eyes closed. He knew the position of the flagpoles and the enemy formation.
From the enemy's perspective, Enkrid’s movements must have seemed ghostly.
A soldier of the Duchy of Azpen, Ron, was startled by the movements of the charging Naurillia soldier as the fog descended.
Suddenly appearing from the left, cutting down three or four of his comrades, and then disappearing with a flick. It seemed like he had vanished.
In reality, he had just lowered his stance.
“Argh!”
“He’s below! He’s below!”
Ron knew that the fog around him was created by sorcery or magic. Thus, the fog didn’t obscure his comrades' vision. However, in the thickest parts of the fog, visibility was hindered.
So, while he could see above his chest well, the ground was hard to see. The enemy acted as if they knew this.
“Kill him!”
“This bastard!”
Shouts erupted from all sides. The enemy soldier moved as if he had ten bodies. Ron was tense. He was ready to smash the enemy’s head as soon as he appeared nearby.
Tension filled the air.
“Argh!”
“Ugh!”
“Over here!”
The enemy soldier still roamed through the fog on the ground like it was his home.
Ron swallowed hard. It felt like a blade could come at him any moment. He felt the urge to pee. But the enemy didn’t appear for a long time. Just as his tension peaked.
“Break the flagpole!”
A scream came from behind. It was the squad leader’s voice. Ron quickly turned his head.
He saw the squad leader fall forward and an enemy soldier rising from the ground beside him.
The sight of the soldier emerging from the fog resembled a skeleton rising from a grave.
‘Was he alone?’
Had one soldier caused all this chaos through the fog?
The enemy grasped his sword with both hands and swung at the flagpole.
Crack!
With a heavy blow, the middle of the flagpole snapped. The flag tilted and fell.
A moment ago, the flag fluttered in the wind. Now it had lost all of its sound and movement.
Thud.
The fallen flag kicked up a cloud of dust. Through the dust, it seemed as if the enemy soldier tilted his head. That’s how it looked to Ron. Then the enemy soldier moved again.
“Kill him! Kill him!”
Someone, as they were dying, grabbed the enemy soldier’s pants. It was commendable, a move worthy of Azpen’s elite.
Allies swarmed over him like bees. The enemy soldier, with two spears in his left side and five quarrels in his thigh, bled profusely and asked.
“Why isn’t the fog lifting? This is supposed to be the medium of sorcery.”
Instead of the dead squad leader, a squad member sneered.
“You idiot, why do you think there are six flagpoles?”
The squad member spoke without restraint. He was about to die anyway. Knowing wouldn’t change anything.
“Five are decoys, only one is real.”
“Crazy bastard.”
“Why is Focus Point so difficult? Well, nothing has been easy so far.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Focus, focus, focus.”
“Crazy bastard.”
Thwack!
The enemy soldier muttered to himself after asking and getting a response, which Ron couldn’t stand and swung his spear shaft.
The enemy soldier’s head burst open, spraying blood. The stricken soldier twitched on the ground, spewing blood.
“Grr.”
Ron turned away from the frothing soldier. Because of this one man, an entire flag unit failed to complete its mission, but the tide had already turned. It was a decisive victory for the Duchy of Azpen. With this fog, defeat was impossible.
The agony of death filled his entire body. To forget the pain, Enkrid sank into thought.
‘How did I learn the Heart of the Beast?’
The sense of the blade was greatly helped by the assassin. The Heart of the Beast was learned by rolling on the battlefield until the brink of death. But the Focus Point didn’t come easily.
Was the boldness from the Heart of the Beast interfering? That didn’t seem right.
If he had managed it easily in a few attempts, Enkrid would have been an exceptionally talented person. It could have been frustrating, but Enkrid remained calm. He wasn’t anxious. There was no need to be.
‘If it doesn’t work, I’ll keep trying until it does.’
With a firm and resolute heart, he knew neither despair nor frustration.
Death came again, and he opened his eyes in the morning. He steeled himself, surrendering his body to the sun and wind.
“They call it Focus Point. Will you learn it?”
Ragna continued teaching as if following a set path, and Enkrid nodded. He learned and learned again, but he couldn’t understand. While learning the fundamentals of Northern-style swordsmanship from Ragna, he had a small realization.
You have to learn it right the first time.
‘Does the fear of death sharpen your nerves?’
No matter how hard he tried, it felt like an ill-fitting suit.
“How did you learn it?”
“I just did.”
Ragna said kindly.
That made it more annoying. Why was he being kind now?
He preferred it when Ragna was being sarcastic.
“Just?”
“Yes, I focused, forgot everything around me, and soon became one with the sword.”
It wasn’t boastful. His tone was matter-of-fact.
“Really?”
“Yes, really.”
What was trivial to Ragna was like an unattainable star to Enkrid. Yet, he felt no jealousy or envy. If he had, he wouldn’t have dreamed of becoming a knight. He repeated the process several times. Ragna would stop the sword right in front of his eyes, urging him to feel the fear of death.
In terms of speed, it seemed Ragna was faster than Rem. Watching their fights, Rem seemed faster. The memory of their duel was still vivid in Enkrid’s mind. When facing Ragna, it felt like he was faster.
“What are you doing? We’re supposed to gather. Are you using the squad leader as practice straw? Are you still upset about losing to me before?”
“Who lost? Your head, maybe?”
Why did these two always fight whenever they met?
“Let’s go.”
Back to the battlefield. Enkrid had learned much through dying. One thing was that five of the six flagpoles were decoys.
‘I just need to aim correctly.’
It was time to test his luck. This time, before the fog even rose, he charged at the approaching enemy.
“...Squad leader?”
He heard Ragna’s surprised voice from behind. Anyone would have thought it was crazy.
“The squad leader’s gone mad!”
Rem shouted. Others murmured, wondering what he was doing, calling him crazy. At that moment, the fog descended.
“What?”
“I can’t see!”
Enkrid shouted as he ran.
“Get down! Shields up!”
Having done it before, he expected them to follow his commands, but the outcome was different this time. His allies were slow to react. Arrows and quarrels flew, ripping through his comrades. The enemy soldiers with spears advanced, and his allies were in a panic.
‘Why?’
The timing was off. They needed a moment to catch their breath after being startled. It was a mistake he knew he made. It was okay. He could fix it next time.
Others might say the goddess of fortune smiled on him or gave him a bag of coins.
Enkrid knew himself well. He wasn’t particularly lucky.
It was the second flagpole he aimed for. It required a fierce battle similar to before. The Focus Point still didn’t come naturally to him. But as he combined the newly honed basics with real combat, his skills improved significantly.
‘Still a long way to go.’
By Enkrid’s standards, Rem and Ragna were the benchmarks. It took him three more repetitions to break the second flagpole. When he finally broke it, the squad leader who had a dagger in his gut coughed up blood and laughed.
“It’s a trick!”
“I know.”
Enkrid nodded with two arrows stuck in his thigh.
“...What?”
“Four left.”
“What?”
“Focus, focus.”
Was his lack of focus the issue?
The Focus Point was challenging. Enkrid ignored the squad leader’s chatter and focused. He deflected the enemy’s spear and swung his sword boldly. The upward slash, much more practiced, split the enemy’s chin.
Crack, split from mouth to nose.
A bolt flew from the side. Thunk, it lodged in his side. Thanks to his armor, he didn’t die, but he hadn’t noticed the five soldiers with crossbows nearby. Around eighty enemies guarded the flagpoles.
Too many for him alone.
‘I need to attack the flagpole and consider my escape route.’
Thinking and strategizing, he surpassed death for the Focus Point and aimed to break the flagpoles. The third flagpole took five more repetitions. The fourth took seven.
‘If I were the enemy commander.’
I would hide the flagpole in the safest place. Before the fog rose, he spent two repetitions scouting the enemy formation.
Finally, he saw it.
A flag unit heavily guarded by the enemy. It was in the deepest part. Enkrid warned his allies without making mistakes and charged. They all got down and raised their shields properly.
“Rem, follow me!”
He called out to Rem.
“What? What are you planning?”
“Just follow!”
He shouted and ran. Rem followed.
“What crazy thing are you doing?”
Instead of answering, Enkrid charged at the flag unit blocking his way with Rem.
“Just the two of you!”
The enemy soldiers roared in anger. Enkrid deftly maneuvered, lowering himself into the fog and pushing the enemy soldiers toward Rem.
“Who is behind this sorcery?”
Rem’s voice was cold as ice as he swung his axe. Looking back, Enkrid saw an enemy’s head fly off with a thud, blood spurting like a fountain.
“Next time, I’ll get the answer from the next one.”
Rem went berserk. Watching this, Enkrid visualized the enemy’s movements. It took five more repetitions to penetrate the innermost flag unit. Five arduous repetitions to finally break through.
Enkrid used his wits. Instead of charging head-on, he approached from the side, lowering his stance and keeping a low profile. He sneaked up to the flagpole.
Then someone blocked his way.
“Am I dreaming?”
The person blocking his path said. Who the hell is this guy?
“By God’s grace, my wish has been granted. I always wanted to kill you myself.”
Enkrid looked at the opponent blocking him and tilted his head. He didn’t remember who he was.
“...You’ve forgotten me in just a few days?”
To his opponent, it had been a few days, but for Enkrid, it had been a year on this battlefield due to the repetitions.
“Sorry, could you introduce yourself?”
Enkrid asked politely, and the opponent’s forehead vein bulged.
“I’m Mitch Hurrier, squad leader of the Duchy of Azpen.”
Even after hearing the name, Enkrid couldn’t recall.
“Alright.”
He nodded, and Mitch glared at him.
“You bastard.”
He drew his sword angrily. As he did, Enkrid’s memory started to surface.
‘Where have I seen him?’
“Wait.”
Enkrid raised his hand to stop him. Mitch paused with his sword pointed.
“What is it?”
“I really don’t remember. Who are you?”
“You’ll remember after taking a few hits!”
Mitch charged. Enkrid drew his longsword to face him.
Clang, clang!
Their swords clashed, the sound of metal ringing out. They locked blades, and Mitch was secretly surprised.
‘This bastard?’
His skill had improved significantly.
Chapter 41: Focus Point
Enkrid aimed for the opponent's eyes, slashed at his shoulder, then moved his sword to cut near the thigh, and pushed the blade forcefully.
He kept his eyes wide open, observing the enemy's movements, gestures, and footwork, predicting the next move.
He anticipated the enemy's strikes, positioning himself defensively to block them all. Sparks flew between them, clearing a part of the fog. Through the gap, two gleaming eyes appeared.
‘Shoulder.’
The enemy’s attack line aimed for his shoulder again. Enkrid then pulled back his left foot which had been positioned forward.
In an instant, his left shoulder tilted back, and the enemy’s sword shot forward fiercely. Pivoting on his right foot’s big toe, he rotated sideways, avoiding the attack. The blade grazed past his shoulder.
Seeing an opportunity, Enkrid adjusted his stance, lowering his sword diagonally and then raising it.
When holding a sword, the side facing the opponent is the front blade, and the side facing oneself is the back blade. Raising the sword from a lowered position makes it a back blade strike. Enkrid aimed the back blade of his sword at the enemy’s chin. He predicted the enemy would dodge.
‘Even if they dodge, it will create an opening.’
He could then spread the next attack line as intended.
This was a tactic he had honed through countless real battles. He aimed to seize the initiative with one step and a connected attack.
“You arrogant bastard!”
The enemy growled, swinging the sword horizontally after the shoulder stab. Enkrid had to duck quickly, causing his upward slash to miss its mark.
Clang!
He had to pull his sword back quickly to block the next attack, lifting it above his head. The enemy had pretended to swing horizontally but then raised the sword to strike down. It was a downward strike. Barely managing to block it, their swords locked, with both men stopping in place.
“Do you think you can catch me with just one step?”
The enemy snarled, pressing down with his sword from above.
“Why, is that not allowed?”
Enkrid replied bluntly. Mitch Hurrier, as he had introduced himself, showed his anger through his eyes and expression, excelling in displaying his rage.
“You don’t want to die gracefully, do you?”
“No, I wish to die of old age.”
Enkrid's sharp retorts rivaled Rem’s, maybe even surpassing him. A thick vein bulged on Mitch's forehead.
“Fine, I’ll cut off your limbs and stuff you in a sewage pit until you die of old age.”
“No, I plan to die of old age with all my limbs intact, next to my great-grandchildren.”
“You bastard!”
Thud!
Mitch kicked forward, but Enkrid blocked it with his foot. They were forced two steps apart. Enkrid swung his sword as soon as the distance widened, while Mitch used his foot to rush forward. Mitch's body, moving at terrifying speed, left a long afterimage. Seeing this, Enkrid adjusted his sword’s trajectory, bringing it down.
Clang!
Their swords met again. The blades clashed, creating a grating sound. Enkrid tried to push Mitch back with force, but it felt as if their swords were stuck together.
Mitch twisted his wrist upwards, lifting his sword towards Enkrid's head, positioning it parallel to the ground.
In an instant, Mitch twisted the blade close to the hilt, the strong part of the sword, wrapping it around Enkrid's sword tip.
Mitch then pushed his sword forward. Even while seething with anger, Mitch’s swordsmanship remained precise.
Clang!
The sound of clashing swords filled the air. If Enkrid stayed in that position, his throat would be pierced. He mimicked Mitch’s movements, twisting his wrist and lifting his sword.
Clang!
Sparks flew between them again. Mitch flicked his sword away. Without a moment to catch his breath, the next strike followed.
This time, Enkrid initiated. A diagonal slash from the upper right to the lower left. It was a move he had drilled countless times, a technique honed through rolling and tumbling in real combat. A graceful line formed as the slash aimed for Mitch’s body.
Step, timing, stance, strike.
It was a textbook-perfect slash. Mitch blocked Enkrid's sword with his own. Enkrid felt as if he was slicing through soft cotton. Mitch’s sword bent gently, deflecting Enkrid’s blade, then reversed, aiming its back edge at Enkrid's head. Mitch drew a small circle with his sword, twisting his wrist.
“Hup!”
Enkrid, gasping for breath, barely managed to twist his body sideways.
Whoosh.
Mitch's sword cut through the space where Enkrid’s head had been. Though he dodged, it disrupted his stance. Mitch’s sword slashed Enkrid’s right forearm. The wound wasn’t deep, but blood flowed freely. There was no time for conversation.
‘Abdomen.’
He had to deflect a thrust aimed at his belly, then avoid a diagonal slash targeting his thigh. He blocked, dodged, and swung his sword at openings. Attempting a horizontal slash to push the enemy back, Mitch remained relentless.
Instead of retreating, Mitch raised his sword and continued to close the distance. They were in the distance where swords conversed. Enkrid found himself on the defensive, focused on blocking and dodging.
‘Upper, diagonal, thrust.’
He poured all his trained basics and real combat experience into his attacks. Thrusting, slashing, pulling back, blocking, and using his feet whenever he saw an opening. Mitch read all his moves, blocking what he could and dodging the rest.
Meanwhile, he inflicted several wounds on Enkrid. First the forearm, then the shoulder, and the thigh, adding minor cuts. Enkrid barely dodged, escaping by the slimmest margin.
One attack, which sent his helmet flying and cut his forehead, felt like sheer luck that he survived.
Blood from his forehead splattered everywhere due to his vigorous movements.
‘Next, the shoulder.’
There was no time to breathe, no time to think. Only blocking, dodging, and attacking. Even amidst this, he occasionally counterattacked. For every three or four hits he took, he managed one strike, but he could continue attacking, so he focused.
One wrong move, and he felt he would die. Mitch felt the same. When he first saw the crazy bastard who raided the camp, his skills had seemed mediocre. Even after a few exchanges, Mitch had seen his limits.
But now?
In just a few days, his skills had improved so much that Mitch questioned if it was the same person.
Perhaps they were twins?
Whenever he had such thoughts, the enemy’s sword targeted his gaps. Mitch realized that one thrust, which grazed his cheek, could have pierced his neck.
‘This bastard.’
Mitch focused. He had no time to think about what was happening around him or where he was. He concentrated solely on killing his opponent. Enkrid did the same. Blocking and dodging. Dodging and blocking. He saw openings but hesitated to exploit them.
If he hesitated to thrust his sword into a gap, he would find himself on the ferryman’s boat on the River of Swords. Even though he would repeat today upon death. Enkrid never intended to waste any of today. He gave it his all. That’s why repeating today had meaning.
‘Chest, no, abdomen.’
He dodged a feint thrust. Blocking and deflecting a sword descending like an eagle. His deflecting skills were crude, more like blocking than parrying. Enkrid’s Northern-style swordsmanship focused on overpowering the opponent with strength.
Mitch, on the other hand, combined Correct Sword and Flowing Sword techniques.
Correct Sword pushed the opponent along a fixed path and then countered. Flowing Sword created openings by deflecting the opponent’s attacks.
Clang.
The clash of swords released heated energy. Enkrid focused entirely, not letting a single nerve rest. Even blinking could spell defeat. In this sword exchange, Enkrid’s mind was free of thoughts of flagpoles, victory, or even swordsmanship. All that remained was to cut, thrust, and swing at his opponent. Everything else disappeared, leaving only one thing.
The sword and I. M and the sword.
The opponent’s sword. The sword and the opponent.
The sword in my hand, the opponent with his sword.
Eventually, he forgot even himself and his opponent.
Self-forgetting.
Only the sword remained.
Swinging, cutting, thrusting, blocking, and dodging filled Enkrid’s being. A surge of exhilaration mixed with a craving for more.
Clang! Clang! Cling! Clang! Shrrring!
The sounds of clashing metal filled the air. But nothing lasts forever.
Knowing this.
‘Just a bit more.’
He wished this moment would last. Enkrid instinctively knew this was not a moment easily encountered by merely repeating today.
He had experienced it once before. A clean strike with no resistance, cutting through the opponent. He had strived to recall that experience. It wasn’t easy. He hadn’t succeeded since.
The same now.
Forgetting himself and leaving only the sword, he wished this moment would last forever. But everything had an end.
Thunk.
As he brought his sword down with the essence of Northern-style swordsmanship, his opponent expertly deflected it. The force went outward, creating an opening in Enkrid’s chest.
Stab!
The opponent didn’t miss the opportunity. The blade, now a scorching hot iron, pierced through Enkrid’s chest.
“Huff.”
With the sword lodged in his chest, Enkrid's arms halted. His limbs trembled. Having exerted himself fully with complete focus, his muscles were strained. Enkrid, with trembling arms and his sword lowered, lifted his head. He saw his opponent, drenched in sweat.
“I remember now,” Enkrid said, blood trickling from his mouth.
“Finally?”
“You were the one holding the torch, right?”
With the sword piercing him, memories slowly resurfaced. The encounter had been that memorable.
“Mitch Hurrier, squad leader of the Duchy of Azpen.”
“Enkrid, squad leader of the Kingdom of Naurillia.”
Both were soaked in blood and sweat. Enkrid's forehead bled profusely, and his body was drenched as if he had been caught in the rain. The same was true for Mitch. They silently regarded each other. For the first time, Enkrid felt no animosity towards the one who had stabbed him to death. He only felt a desperate desire to fight again.
Mitch Hurrier was expressionless, but his eyes revealed a change. The rage had subsided, replaced by an indescribable emotion.
“The dream is over.”
Dream? Oh.
“It was a lie. A swordsman’s wish isn’t to die of old age, is it?”
“Just die already.”
Mitch spoke, then yanked his sword free. The blade, like a heated skewer, tore through his chest again. The pain was so intense it made his mind go blank. Enkrid, enduring the pain, knelt on one knee. Blood gushed from his throat, pouring out of his mouth. Without having to spit, the blood surged out.
“What’s going on? Is this an enemy?”
By now, a group of Azpen soldiers surrounded them. One of them spoke as he approached.
‘I didn’t even see them.’
Enkrid glanced around. He was surrounded by enemies.
“Yes, he sneaked all the way here. Seems to specialize in ambushes.”
“You look disappointed, squad leader.”
“No, I’m not.”
Mitch said, staring at Enkrid. Honestly, he was disappointed. Such an opponent was rare to find. It felt like he had stepped into a new realm, risking his life.
Naturally, he felt regret. But his opponent’s face showed no such emotion. He seemed relieved, excited like a seven-year-old holding a wooden sword.
“What are you?”
Mitch asked, bewildered, but Enkrid wasn’t listening anymore. He was dying, and his mind was dominated by one thought.
‘Ragna, you crazy bastard. It’s not the fear of death that’s needed.’
The necessary condition for the Focus Point wasn’t the concentration at the moment of death. It required an opponent who could match your abilities and emotions, someone with whom you could engage in a life-and-death struggle.
An opponent who could elevate you, making you pour everything you had into the fight to survive. Such an intense battle, where taking your eyes off for a moment could end it all.
A true rival was needed. In that sense, Mitch Hurrier was perfect. He was a worthy adversary. Enkrid realized this as he lay dying. The sensations and experiences he just had were exactly what Ragna meant by the Focus Point.
He had achieved it. And he had the chance to relive it, to recall that sensation and experience by repeating today. Being able to recreate that moment he wished to last a bit longer.
That was the Focus Point.
Would it be easy? No. But he would keep trying until he succeeded. Mitch Hurrier’s existence made it possible.
Enkrid understood this.
So how could he not be excited?
Seeing the path ahead again, Enkrid died with a smile.
“Was he a lunatic?”
Mitch tilted his head, puzzled by Enkrid’s smile as he died.
Chapter 42: He’s Lucky
Ragna asked about the technique of the Focus Point.
"Are you going to learn it?"
"Of course."
Enkrid didn't hesitate.
'When did my skills improve so much?'
He had firmly grasped the basics of the Northern-style. It wasn’t just swinging aimlessly in the air and learning the stance; he honed it through real battles until it became second nature.
‘Impressive.’
The squad leader was a fascinating person. Just yesterday, he had relied on the Mercenary Sword Techniques, but today he displayed rock-solid fundamentals.
"Who taught you the sword?"
"It cost a lot of money."
He implied he learned from a swordsmanship instructor.
‘It must have cost a lot indeed.’
That made sense. Even with his guidance, it couldn’t have been better than this. So, it was time to learn beyond the basics. That’s why he brought up the Focus Point.
However, Ragna was somewhat skeptical.
‘Not everyone can master this.’
Although he claimed to have developed it, it was actually one of the secret techniques passed down in his family. Of course, he didn’t teach it as it was. He couldn’t just hand out his family’s secrets to anyone, so he modified and adapted it. Thus, it wasn’t entirely inaccurate to say it was his own creation.
‘I’ve rarely seen it succeed.’
Ragna had seen fewer than five people who could enter the state of concentration. Given the time he had spent wandering the continent and his experiences, this was an exceedingly small number.
‘Not even five, probably just three.’
Among the five, two had stumbled upon it by sheer luck, like an arrow hitting a wolf’s head. It was as if they had found a coin dropped by the goddess of fortune. So, the number of people who could properly wield the Focus Point was really just three.
It required talent. Forgetting one’s surroundings and focusing entirely was no easy feat. This kind of talent wasn’t limited to swordsmanship. Some scholars exhibited such focus when learning and mastering their fields. They could even enter that state at will, immersing themselves fully.
But could one do that in the midst of battle?
It was hard not to be skeptical. Even if luck allowed someone to experience it briefly, mastering it was a different matter.
‘It’s incredibly difficult.’
Ragna had stepped into the state of the Focus Point and made it his own, but it would be tough for Enkrid. So why did he look so determined?
"Won’t you explain it to me, Ragna?"
How could he be so straightforward and earnest?
It felt like looking at a sturdy tree. A great tree that stood tall even in the face of storms and lightning. Despite knowing it was close to chasing clouds, the squad leader wanted to learn. And he nodded as if he understood, seeming genuinely earnest. It appeared real. After all, the squad leader was always sincere. Whether training, swinging a sword, or doing anything else, he approached it with his utmost effort. That’s what impressed Ragna and led him to teach him this technique.
"I think I get it."
The squad leader said, and Ragna, thinking Enkrid might have misunderstood, nodded anyway. It was a nod of encouragement.
He knew the limits of talent well. While it’s said geniuses don’t see what’s beneath their feet, Ragna, having wandered the continent, had seen those depths. He had met and sparred with those who lived underground.
‘Talent.’
So many had fallen to those two letters. The squad leader would be one of them. It was an inevitable truth. Even so, seeing him not give up, Ragna felt motivated. Selfishly, the squad leader’s persistence allowed him to walk his own path.
So, he decided to teach him with all his might.
"Forget your surroundings and yourself, leaving only pure focus. That’s the Focus Point. It’s like how people say their life flashes before their eyes when they’re at death’s door. That might be a good reference."
"Is that so? Got it."
As he explained this, the squad leader seemed to brush it off. He wasn’t usually like this. Especially not the type to give up when things seemed impossible. Ragna tried to force him into a state of concentration by threatening him with a sword several times, but the squad leader still couldn’t enter that state.
"Alright. Let’s go."
Yet, he headed to the battlefield with a bright face. Seeing that, Ragna felt a sudden surge of enthusiasm.
"Today, I’ll have to loosen up seriously."
Normally, he would lazily swing his sword, epitomizing a lazy genius. This wasn’t something he would normally say. Enkrid quietly observed this unusual Ragna.
What’s up with him now?
Well, it wasn’t bad that he was taking the fight seriously. Leaving the bright-eyed Ragna behind, Enkrid focused on his task. Today started again. Ragna's method for training the Focus Point was wrong. Even if it was right, the method that worked instantly for a genius didn’t suit him.
So was his method correct?
He didn’t know if it would work or not.
Then what should he do?
‘Test it out.’
Enkrid moved along the familiar route. He ordered everyone to lie down, then hold up their shields, adjusting their movements, and called Rem.
"Who! The! Fuck! Is doing the sorcery!"
Rem was fuming about the sorcery.
"Follow me!"
He patted Rem’s shoulder from behind.
"Huh?"
"Charge."
"What? Did you eat something bad, squad leader?"
Even while saying that, he followed. It was the same route. This time, Ragna followed without being called.
"Are we charging? If it’s breaking through the enemy vanguard, let’s do it together."
"Did you eat something bad too?"
Rem looked at Ragna and said. Ragna ignored him and sprinted forward. Though the fog surrounded them, it didn’t significantly hinder their movements. Rem was like a typhoon, his dual axes shredding the enemy. He looked ready to take down eighty soldiers by himself.
Ragna was like a heavy battering ram. He smashed through the infantry formations like a wall, cutting down and slicing with his arming sword, showing no mercy. It was an astonishing display.
‘At least exceptional level.’
Exceptional level referred to soldiers of above-average skill in the Kingdom of Naurillia. Above average was top-tier, and beyond that was exceptional.
‘Or perhaps top-tier.’
Enkrid wasn’t sure of his own level yet. So, he couldn’t precisely gauge their level. Regardless, now wasn’t the time to be observing idly. Following the same route, Enkrid stood before Mitch Hurrier.
"Let’s have a match."
This time, he initiated the conversation. Mitch widened his eyes, then laughed.
"You crazy bastard, did you come to die?"
He wasn’t wrong. Even if he killed Mitch now, there would be no way to survive.
But that was fine.
He didn’t come to die; he came to give his best shot.
"Did you come targeting me? That’s impressive; it’s the first time this has happened."
Mitch expressed his surprise openly.
"Why? Is this your first confession? I fell in love at first sight and came looking for you."
Enkrid said. Mitch chuckled, then glared.
"We’re the Gray Hounds, reknowned for for relentless pursuit. It’s been a while since someone came looking for me before I found them."
"Is that so? Are you upset? Should I hide again so you can come find me?"
"Enough nonsense."
Mitch Hurrier charged. Enkrid steadied his breath. He tried to enter a state of focus but failed. The fight's outcome was quickly decided. The opponent was superior in skill, mental strength, and talent. He wasn’t someone who could be taken down with just basic techniques.
"What made you think you could take me on? How did you get here?"
His lungs and intestines were shredded by the sword. It felt like someone had placed burning coals inside his stomach, painfully hot.
"I trusted myself. I made a mistake this time, and my mindset was wrong."
Living today over and over again didn’t mean repeating the same experience was easy.
"What?"
"Next time, I think I can do it."
Just as he had realized something when he first entered a state of focus, he now gained a small insight. So, he would try again.
"Even if I let you go, you’ll die. There’s no next time."
"Is he crazy? Don’t bother with him, squad leader."
Shing!
One of the enemy soldiers next to him drew his sword and placed it against Enkrid's neck. Enkrid didn’t wait and twisted his neck to cut himself on the blade.
Riiip.
The sword was well-sharpened, causing a sharp pain and a deep cut on his neck. With the combined pain from his stomach and neck, Enkrid spoke, enduring the agony.
"See you again."
He left those words, bleeding out and dying.
The day began again. Enkrid sought out Mitch Hurrier once more.
"Good to see you, my friend."
"...Did you really come looking for me?"
"Yes, that's right. I came to find the Gray Hounds' squad leader, the relentless pursuer. Let's have a match."
"You really are crazy bastard."
They fought again. Enkrid realized his mistake.
‘Don’t force it.’
If he focused too hard on entering the state, he became fixated on that thought. So what should he do?
Do it like the first time. Move with the flow of the opponent’s sword, matching the rhythm with his own. Fight and fight again.
The same method required eighteen more days. Only then did Enkrid re-enter the state of focus. It was exhilarating. Even though one of his arms was severed and he was lying on the ground, he couldn't help but smile. The joy overwhelmed the pain.
"Are you smiling?"
Seeing this, Mitch struck down with his sword. That ended it. He repeated the day again. He continued until he succeeded. To anyone watching, it would have seemed like an act of sheer tenacity, an extraordinary display of persistence.
But to Enkrid, it wasn’t about persistence. Entering a state of focus, improving his skills through constant battle, meeting a worthy opponent, and refining his techniques. It was immensely satisfying and enjoyable.
Twenty-eight more days passed, and Enkrid got the hang of the state of focus.
After forty-eight more days, he could intentionally enter the state of focus.
And after ninety-four more days, he could enter the state of focus at will.
Pure concentration. This meant he had complete control over his sword and body. With this mastery, skill combined with strength. Once he had fully grasped the Focus Point, he returned to Ragna for further learning. When he demonstrated the Focus Point, Ragna frowned.
"What is it?"
"Why?"
"It looks like you’ve already learned this somewhere... No, it’s not something that can be learned easily. Were you a genius?"
A genius? Despite the fortunate experiences and intense training, it took him over a hundred repetitions to finally get it right. Enkrid knew he lacked natural talent, but he didn't let it bother him. He was simply enjoying the present moment.
So, he repeated the familiar phrase.
"I was lucky."
"Does luck get you this far?"
Ragna was baffled. Seeing Ragna’s reaction, Enkrid knew it was time to leave this repeating day. He left Ragna after absorbing the essence of the Focus Point, pretending to be a genius, and then turned to leave. Ragna asked,
"Where are you going?"
"To meet the company commander."
Ragna let Enkrid go. He was still amazed at how Enkrid had grasped the Focus Point in such a short time. Could the squad leader really be a genius? It didn’t seem likely.
Despite Enkrid demonstrating the Focus Point, the technique bore the marks of meticulous practice. It wasn’t something that could be mastered in one try.
‘How is that possible?’
Ragna pondered for a moment but soon dismissed the thought. There was no point in worrying about it. Letting it go was the answer. Watching a squad leader like that simply motivated him. Enkrid saw the sparkle in Ragna’s eyes again today and thought, ‘Whatever he does, today will be a day full of motivation for him.’
‘I should focus on my own tasks.’
There was no time to be concerned about Ragna. This battle would result in near-total annihilation of the allies no matter what.
To prevent that, two things were needed. One was to dispel the Fog of Annihilation. The other was for the allies to find cover while the fog cleared.
It wasn’t possible to do both simultaneously. Enkrid had only one body.
Breaking the flagpoles also posed a problem. After ambushing the enemy, he would need to escape from the heart of the enemy lines. Enkrid had no intention of remaining trapped in this day. He needed to shatter the enemy’s strategy.
"I need to see the company commander."
Enkrid sought out the 4th Platoon Leader and said.
"...Now?"
With the tension of the approaching battle palpable, the ally camp’s atmosphere was tense. It was understandable for the platoon leader to be taken aback by such a request. The platoon leader, who was resting with his spear propped against the wall, rose from his cot.
"Yes, now."
"Why?"
"I remembered something from the previous reconnaissance mission."
The 4th Platoon Leader scrutinized Enkrid for a moment, then nodded and got up. There was a cracking sound as his knee joints adjusted. He stood up, stretched, and asked,
"What is it?"
"It seems that the Azpen Army has hidden something sorcery."
"Sorcery?"
"Yes."
The platoon leader hesitated, wondering if this was credible. However, recalling that Enkrid wasn’t one to speak nonsense, he started walking briskly. If there was something to say, it had to be said. The company commander would make the judgment. Soon, they arrived at the company commander's tent and were allowed entry.
"You wanted to see me?"
The company commander, a green-eyed elf, asked. The tent was cozy. As Enkrid watched the short torches burn with a crackling sound, he nodded.
"Yes."
"For what reason?"
It seemed that the commander might scold him if it wasn’t serious. The elf commander’s tone was cold.
"It’s about sorcery."
Enkrid got straight to the point.
"sorcery?"
"I saw a person in the enemy camp carrying a flag. It looked like a sorcerer."
Thanks to endlessly repeating the day, he could vaguely remember seeing it, but he hadn’t forgotten what he saw. Enkrid slightly embellished what he saw. Just enough to be convincing. If this wasn’t persuasive enough, there was nothing more he could do.
‘I’ll just have to try again.’
It was the privilege of someone who relived today endlessly. Fortunately, the elf commander listened to Enkrid attentively.
"Tell me more."
"Of course."
He said he heard the enemy shouting about a sorcerer. The elf commander’s eyes glinted.
He didn’t mention that the fog would appear. That would be too much. sorcery was a closely guarded secret, not easily identified. This much would suffice. The rest was up to the commander’s abilities. Enkrid conveyed his message and returned to his position.
He was now at the forefront of the battlefield. It was time to surpass Mitch Hurrier and break the flagpoles.
‘This is as much as I can do.’
The rest was up to the leaders.
"Huuh."
It was time to transcend being trapped in this day.
Chapter 43: Mitch Hurrier
In Azpen, three families were the cornerstone of its governance, with the Hurrier family symbolizing martial prowess. Every child born in the Hurrier family, whether male or female, learned martial arts. They assessed each child's talent, and gathered and taught only those who showed promise.
Talent was capricious, and the whims of the goddess of fortune were unpredictable. To collect this biased talent, the Hurrier family recruited people from both direct and collateral lines.
Mitch Hurrier was one of them. Born into a collateral branch with a different surname, he became a member of the Hurrier family.
From a young age, Mitch Hurrier exhibited extraordinary talent. By the age of fifteen, he could already handle a couple of adult soldiers. The following year, he surpassed the level of ordinary soldiers by leaps and bounds. At eighteen, he proved his skills by defeating a swordsman renowned enough to represent a village in a one-on-one match. At just twenty-two, he could spar with those famous enough to make a name for themselves in a city without falling behind.
There were few who could match his swordsmanship. Especially among his peers. Such an environment gifted him with arrogance.
"Why bother when I can do it a few times and get it?"
Why train until his thighs were swollen? Why swing his sword until his palms were torn?
He didn't want to. He was content with the present. He didn't strive as he did when he first picked up a sword. Yet, solely due to his talent, he became one of the top three skilled warriors in Grey Hounds.
For Mitch, this was a first.
Clang!
He deflected a downward sword strike from below. Momentarily careless, the blade grazed his shoulder. Mitch thrust his sword and kicked at his opponent's shin.
It was a technique he often used against those less skilled than himself. It's not easy to block a kick aimed at your leg when you're focused on the sword.
Even if blocked, it creates an opening. The opponent, familiar with this pattern, dodged the thrust by twisting his shoulder and blocked the kick by raising one foot. His balance remained unshaken. He had solid fundamentals.
‘He wasn't at this level before.’
Mitch recalled the moment he faced the man earlier. The man had suddenly approached and casually spoken.
"Hello, nice to meet you. How about we have a life-or-death duel since we met?"
A familiar face. It was definitely that bastard. An enemy soldier who had executed a night raid.
Despite the fog obstructing the view, how did he get here?
There was no time to ponder. The opponent extended his sword first.
Clang!
As Mitch blocked, he thought. It could be another feint. He ordered the rear to be guarded, planning to handle this guy himself. If the flagpole fell, it would severely disrupt their strategy. That's why he was here.
While the company commander of Grey Hounds was tasked with capturing and driving out the enemy’s retreat, Mitch's role was to defend this spot. The enemy soldier who blocked his kick aimed a downward strike at Mitch's head.
Mitch parried and deflected the opponent's sword, creating a cross shape with his own.
Ting!
As the blades crossed, they brushed past each other at an angle. At the last moment, both applied force, pushing each other away.
A gap of over five steps formed between them. Before attacking again, Mitch spoke.
"Were you hiding your skill?"
"Kind of."
"What's your name?"
"Enkrid."
He was someone Mitch had desperately wanted to meet. Someone he felt he needed to kill to be satisfied. That guy had come in person.
Mitch licked his lips.
"Alright, Enkrid. I'll remember your name."
"No need to. If you forget, I'll remind you."
"You crazy bastard, you're going to die here."
Mitch raised his sword over his left shoulder. After a few clashes, he could gauge his opponent's skill. Now it was time to show his real strength. He believed he could sever Enkrid’s head within five strikes.
And five sword strikes passed. Mitch's brow furrowed. His expression darkened. This was a first. If the opponent's skill was overwhelmingly superior, he could understand, but it wasn't. The opponent barely managed to keep up with him. Yet, it felt as if he knew all of Mitch's habits, blocking, enduring, and countering his strikes. Mitch increased his speed and mixed in feints. Still, it didn’t end.
After a few more exchanges, he saw only the opponent. The sword and the opponent, the blade and himself, himself and the blade.
Mitch Hurrier felt like he did when he first picked up a sword. At that moment, when he first held a sword, the feeling that only he and the sword existed under the sky. It felt like if he swung the sword, it would cut through the opponent. If he thrust, it would pierce. If he pulled back and struck, it would hit.
Mitch did just that.
He struck downward, swung around, extended, thrust, and struck again.
And so did the opponent.
Enkrid reached a state of intense focus. In that state, he exchanged swords with Mitch. Thanks to countless repetitions today, he could see through Mitch's habits. Blocking kicks and parrying swords.
Then, the opponent's sword changed for an instant. It was sharper and more vicious than before. Slashing and curving, cutting and twisting.
Clang! Clang! Clang!
With a fierce clash, sparks flew from the blades. Several strikes grazed his shoulder and side.
Though the wounds weren’t deep, blood sprayed into the air. There were at least three moments where his life was in danger.
In those moments, Enkrid’s concentration deepened. He deliberately pushed himself into a heightened state. Forgetting the surroundings, entering a world where only he and his sword existed.
A single point of focus was fully activated. In his eyes, only Mitch Hurrier’s sword was visible.
In Mitch Hurrier’s eyes, only Enkrid’s sword was visible.
They fought like madmen. Risking each other’s lives. Even to the onlookers, their attacks were terrifying.
Splat.
When they failed to slash each other's necks, both bled from the neck. Maintaining his concentration, Mitch used his ultimate pattern. Stepping back with his left foot and forward with his right, creating an unfamiliar distance.
He lowered his sword behind his hip.
"Inhale."
He took a short breath, tensing his muscles. A sword technique blending precision and flexibility. It resembled techniques that could parry and deflect.
Mitch mastered a technique involving a sudden reversal strike. A wheel cut that drew a large circle from bottom to top. By changing his stance and covering his sword with his body, he concealed the starting point of his attack, making it a nearly unblockable strike.
Adjusting his foot position to alter the distance was solely for this wheel cut. As his opponent prepared for the wheel cut, Enkrid experienced an intense state of immersion. Through that experience, he gained more than just swordsmanship.
‘I see it.’
Though not visible, he could vividly picture his opponent’s movements in his mind. In his single-point focus, his hearing became incredibly sharp.
He could hear the sound of steps, the breath taken as the sword was drawn back. Every sound collected as information, forming a mental image. He had died to the wheel cut more than ten times. Having experienced countless defeats to this very technique, the image in Enkrid’s mind was crystal clear.
It was as if he could see the hidden sword and hear his opponent’s breath. All of this combined, allowing him to read the timing of the wheel cut.
Whoosh.
The sound of the blade slicing through the wind pierced his ears. Soon, the blade soared from bottom to top in an arc. In his heightened state, Enkrid reflexively brought his sword down. Precisely on the trajectory to block the wheel cut.
Clang!
The upward blade and the downward blade met. Both applied such force that a crack formed on Enkrid’s sword with a loud snap. At the moment the swords collided, Mitch was surprised that his strike was blocked, breaking his concentration halfway.
But Enkrid was different.
With a partially cracked sword, Enkrid’s blade slid along Mitch’s sword.
Screeeech!
The friction between the blades produced a peculiar noise. Mitch instinctively raised his sword. Normally, it would have been lifted, but Enkrid pressed down with force. Naturally, it was advantageous to push down from above rather than lifting from below.
Moreover, with daily training, Enkrid’s strength was superior. In a contest of strength, Mitch stood no chance. Enkrid pressed down on the blade, then extended his left foot forward, adding more force and pushing the sword downwards.
Screech!
Mitch’s sword was knocked down. Enkrid, in that moment, extended his left foot and twisted his waist, thrusting his sword forward. The tip of the blade plunged into Mitch’s chest.
Though Mitch wore armor, the force behind the sword was immense. His chest was pierced.
However, it didn’t penetrate completely. Enkrid pulled his sword back.
Slick, the blood-stained blade withdrew.
“Huff, huff.”
Enkrid retrieved his sword, catching his breath. He had given his all in a brief moment. His limbs trembled.
Blood gushed from Mitch’s chest. He staggered back a few steps like a drunken man, then steadied himself. Mitch’s pupils seemed to dilate, but soon he widened his eyes and gathered strength.
"I should have aimed for a counter."
Mitch spoke. Blood still flowed from his chest. It wasn't a small amount. The running blood quickly soaked his clothes.
"If I had deflected and created an opening, the fight would have favored me. Don't you agree?"
"Isn't victory decided by the outcome?"
Enkrid responded with a question.
"You’re not wrong, but it's frustrating. Maybe I shouldn't have skipped training. In the end, I lost purely due to strength."
Mitch's gaze grew hazy. Even if left alone, he would die. The bleeding was increasing. Enkrid took a step forward, raising his sword.
"Stop!"
Just as he was about to thrust his sword, someone shouted and rushed at him. With a heavy sound, Enkrid instinctively angled his sword to partially shield his upper body.
Clang!
A heavy impact hit his sword. Enkrid took two steps back and looked at his new opponent. It was a man with a mustache. He stood protectively in front of Mitch.
"Protect Mitch!"
The man shouted. Enkrid looked around. Several soldiers appeared and formed a protective barrier around Mitch.
Then they sprinkled a powdered medicine on Mitch's chest. The bleeding from his chest quickly stopped.
"You bastard. Do you know where you are?"
The mustached man glared at him. He seemed incredibly angry. His eyes flicked over Mitch.
Was this guy important?
Enkrid steadied his breath, observing his opponent. His shoulders heaved, indicating heavy breathing.
But his stance had no openings.
The mustached man had just checked the flagpole and returned. He had thought Mitch would win. Enkrid's skills didn’t seem that exceptional. But the result was the opposite.
Despite having defeated Mitch, Enkrid did not let it excite him. There was still work to be done. This was a battlefield, and they were still in the midst of battle.
Romantic one-on-one duels or spars were not the purpose here. Enkrid was clear about what he had to do.
"Isn't it said that the bigger the medium for magic, the more fragile it becomes? Is that true?"
Seeing Mitch being carried away by two soldiers, Enkrid spoke. The mustached man squinted his eyes.
"You know quite a bit."
A lot.
Enkrid planted his foot firmly and kicked upward. With a burst, dirt and short grass flew up, covering the mustached man's face. The man quickly raised his hand to block and shouted.
"Stop him! Don't let him near the flagpole!"
Enkrid sprinted as soon as he saw the man’s vision obstructed.
Swish!
A bolt flew from behind. Enkrid twisted his body to the left, but one bolt struck his right shoulder from behind.
'This much is manageable.'
Enkrid sprinted straight towards the flagpole. An enemy soldier blocked his way, holding a spear. Charging like a rhinoceros, Enkrid slammed his foot into the ground five steps before, veering to the right. The bolt intended for Enkrid struck the soldier holding the spear.
"Agh! My eye!"
The unlucky soldier was hit in the eye. More than three soldiers were struck in their arms or torsos.
"Stop shooting! Stop shooting!"
A commander among the crossbowmen shouted. Enkrid, maintaining a semi-focused state, combined his heightened awareness with the sense of his blade. He listened to the sounds, creating a mental map of the enemy’s positions and actions. He reversed direction, diving into the midst of the crossbowmen, sword in hand.
"Huh!"
A startled soldier received a downward slash to his head, splitting his skull. The momentum of the slash lifted the sword back up. Enkrid swung his sword in a circle around himself.
Whoosh!
The frightened soldiers stepped back.
"Gray Hounds! Pursue them!"
The mustached man ordered. Enkrid, having charged into the crossbowmen, now dashed to the other side.
Thrust!
He pierced the throat of a soldier while moving. Picking up a fallen bolt, he threw it sideways.
Thud! The bolt hit the soldier’s armor and fell to the ground.
The soldier, who had drawn a short sword instead of a crossbow, rushed at him, only to be struck in the forehead by a throwing knife that followed the bolt. The soldier had let his guard down after blocking the bolt.
“Huff!”
Exhaling sharply, Enkrid moved through the enemy lines as if it were his own home. He had two objectives. One was to destroy the flagpole. The other was to pray that the allied commander would stop making foolish decisions and secure the rear.
"You bastard!"
The mustached man was furious. His anger seemed to have reached its peak. Enkrid darted around and finally reached the vicinity of the flagpole. He threw all the throwing knives in his hand.
Swish, swish, swish!
Five throwing knives flew towards the fluttering flag. The flag was thick and not easily torn. Seeing Enkrid throw the knives, the enemy soldiers were startled.
“Damn it!”
More soldiers cursed.
"Block him! Stop him!"
A figure presumed to be a sorcerer under the flagpole shouted. As everyone’s attention was on the knives piercing the flag, Enkrid rolled on the ground. Even though there was no immediate threat like arrows or bolts, his sudden forward roll didn’t draw much attention.
His pause allowed the mustached man to close the distance.
Got you, bastard.
The mustached man thought, certain of his victory. Enkrid was in the midst of picking up a fallen spear.
"Stop him!"
"No!"
Both the mustached man and the sorcerer shouted. Enkrid responded with action. He stomped his left foot and used his entire body’s momentum to throw the spear.
Bang! The spear flew towards the flag.
Rip!
The flag tore, creating a hole. If a magic medium was damaged, it would be rendered useless. There was no need to topple the flagpole.
Simply tearing the flag would suffice. There was no need to reach the front. Seeing the mist dissipate around him, Enkrid let out a sigh of relief. It was a sigh of relief.
“You crazy bastard, do you think you’ll get out of here alive?”
The mustached man’s eyes blazed with anger. Enkrid raised his sword, aligning it with the center of his body, and nodded.
“Maybe?”
The odds were fifty-fifty. Half a chance to live, half a chance to die. For most, those were terrible odds.
But not for Enkrid. If he failed, he could just try again.
Chapter 44: The Savior with Blue Eyes
The elf company commander twitched her ears. At that moment, it was as if she could vividly picture everything happening around her. Heightened senses were an innate talent of the elves. She relied on her hearing, taking two steps to the right.
Swish.
She positioned herself in front of an enemy soldier thrusting a long spear. She stood at the forefront of her troops. The elf company commander struck the spear shaft upward.
Simultaneously, the sword in her hand moved forward like a leaf caught in the wind, piercing the enemy soldier's neck and returning.
Squelch! Pop!
Blood spurted from the hole in the neck. She flicked her sword towards the ground, blood scattering from the blade. She kept moving. Staying in one place would only make her a target for bolts. The elf company commander swung her leaf-like sword as she ran.
Ting.
Two bolts were deflected by the blade.
The sword she wielded was called "Naidhl," a unique elven weapon. It was shorter and more pointed compared to a regular sword, and was shaped like a streamlined leaf.
When the hilt was pulled out, the blade resembled a canoe or a leaf.
Elven swordsmanship combined three styles: flow, precision, and swift strikes. Naidhl was a weapon specialized for this kind of swordsmanship.
The company commander demonstrated this skill now. No soldier could withstand her technique of deflecting long spears and piercing like a beam of light.
‘This is not good.’
Even while slaughtering her opponents, the elf company commander felt a sense of dread.
Was magic always this dangerous?
She had once fought a warrior under the berserk spell. The berserk warrior, who charged without caring for his wounds, was dangerous and fierce but the magic was temporary. It was not capable of encompassing an entire battlefield.
The extent of her knowledge about sorcery was limited to that. Hence, she was astonished when the fog first appeared.
Was this sorcery?
Fortunately, she had been prepared and responded properly. When the fog rolled in, the elf company commander ordered her unit to form a circular formation, narrowing their ranks. They executed the commands "down" and "shields" promptly.
As she shouted, a few squad leaders frantically repeated the orders like parrots, holding their ground. Suddenly unable to see ahead, it was easy to fall into a state of panic.
Naturally, the situation was grim. Yet, she did her job.
Leaving the formation, she cut and thrust at the enemy vanguard alone. Without such actions, her troops would have been quickly annihilated.
At least, the first company would hold on.
‘That bastard of a battalion commander.’
The elf company commander cursed inwardly.
Potato sprouts are poisonous. Elves often used plant metaphors. When potatoes sprout, the sprouts must be removed before eating. Otherwise, the body accumulates toxins.
The current battalion commander was just like those poisonous potato sprouts.
In such dire circumstances, the command should have devised a plan, but there was no order from the battalion commander. No horn, no shout, no command. Relying only on his backers, he led the unit negligently.
Despite numerous warnings about the sorcery, he seemed not to take it seriously.
This kingdom was like a peach covered in mold. Rotten to the core.
How could they dispatch such a worthless person as a battalion commander to the front lines?
‘Even with luck.’
Would even ten out of a hundred survive?
The fog blinded her troops. That was deadly. As she foresaw such a bleak future, the fog suddenly lifted before her eyes.
"Hmm?"
The elf company commander halted with Naidhl in hand. She was bewildered. The fog dissipated as quickly as it had formed. The enemy was more surprised than she was.
"Huh?"
An enemy soldier with a long spear in front of her froze, unable to thrust his weapon.
The elf company commander's surprise was brief. She had fought well even in the fog. She swung Naidhl again, tracing a semicircle in the air and slicing through the enemy's throat.
"Ugh!"
Another enemy soldier fell. The company commander judged this as the turning point. There was no time to ponder why the fog had lifted.
"Everyone, turn around! Counterattack!"
Her shout was echoed by others.
"Charge! Charge! Charge!"
"Kill them! Kill them all!"
"You bastards!"
"Slaughter them all!"
As the momentum shifted, so did the battlefield's flow. The elf company commander retrieved Naidhl and held her ground. Soon, her company passed by her.
"Commander!"
The first platoon leader shouted.
"Cut them all down."
The company commander replied. The first platoon leader answered with a battle cry.
"Argh!"
The air of the battlefield heated up. The gloomy atmosphere lingering among her troops vanished in an instant.
Only then did the elf company commander wonder why the fog had suddenly disappeared.
‘Could it be?’
That squad leader?
She had no concrete reason, but she felt he was responsible. It was a pure hunch. The Elf's instincts were still sharp.
The Captain of the Gray Hounds, an independent company of the Azpen Kingdom, was blocking the retreat. He stood exactly where the fog lifted. It was simply a matter of killing any enemy that emerged. The fleeing enemies, in a panic, were easy targets.
But suddenly, the fog cleared.
"What the hell? Why did the fog clear?"
"Captain, the enemy is turning around."
There were no hills to obscure the view on the Green Pearl Plains. They could see the Naurillia Kingdom's troops turning around.
The Captain quickly assessed the situation. Either the sorcerer messed up or the sorcery was flawed, something went wrong. If left as is, the strategy they had prepared would completely collapse.
"Flank them! Don’t push through; cut around the sides! Follow me!"
The captain dashed forward. They struck the rear of the Naurillia Kingdom's troops. By attacking the rear, they aimed to assist the withdrawal of their frontline troops.
"Goddamn it."
The Captain of the Gray Hounds vowed to punish whoever was responsible for lifting the fog.
Enkrid realized how badly his calculations were off. The bolt lodged in his right shoulder blade made it difficult to swing his sword properly. His opponent was slightly more skilled than Mitch Hurrier.
Even when trying to focus on a single point, there were enemies suddenly thrusting spears from behind.
No, having spearmen aiming for his back was the least of his worries. Five crossbowmen were following him, constantly aiming at him. Because of them, a bolt was also embedded in his thigh.
‘Running is out of the question with this leg.’
His cracked sword had already broken in half. His opponent wielded a heavy sword, using a strong and aggressive technique. Blood from his thigh and back mingled with the blood of his enemies, covering Enkrid in blood.
Seeing him stand with a half-broken sword, the mustached man was secretly impressed. Despite being an enemy who ruined their sorcery and spoke arrogantly, his spirit was remarkable. Even now, he showed no signs of giving up.
"What makes you so confident?"
The mustached man asked. Enkrid steadied his breath, taking in the sight of the crossbowmen behind his opponent.
"What do you mean?"
"Why haven't you given up yet?"
Enkrid answered without hesitation.
"Huff, I'm a squad leader."
"So?"
"In my squad, there are two friends named Rem and Ragna."
"Hmm?"
"They fight so well that you can’t tell that they're just squad members."
"Are they coming to rescue you?"
"That was one scenario."
Having come this far, he thought they'd be nearby.
But no, they weren’t. He should have seen them by now. If they hadn't come by now, they wouldn't be coming at all.
That was the truth.
At that moment, Rem was decimating an enemy unit and cutting through tall grass. Ragna, hindered by the fog, fought off any approaching enemies without advancing further. After the fog cleared, he rejoined their troops. Neither knew where their squad leader was.
The mustached man took a step forward, sword in hand. Enkrid dragged his injured right leg backward. Yet, his gaze was still sharp, intent on something. Where could he be planning to escape with that leg?
Enkrid regarded the mustached man, thinking he was a meticulous bastard. But that didn’t mean he would give up on "today." If he died, he would just start over. He knew that all too well. But he didn't think he had sustained a fatal injury yet.
Above all, if he had spent his countless "todays" meaninglessly, Enkrid wouldn’t be who he was now. Until the brink of death, Enkrid would resist. He would do his utmost to live through "today." He was the kind to struggle to the end without giving up.
"It's a shame that you're an enemy."
The mustached man said, taking another step forward. Enkrid couldn’t retreat any further. Behind him, a soldier with a spear eyed him with a fierce look. He glanced back once and then faced forward again. The mustached man gripped his sword with both hands.
The longer blade of his broken sword reflected the sunlight that had broken through the fog.
‘Right? Left?’
Which way should he dodge?
Whichever way he chose, he couldn’t avoid a fatal injury. But he didn’t want to die quietly.
‘If I can't dodge...’
Enkrid gripped the broken sword tightly. If he couldn’t go left, right, or backward, he had to move forward. The moment the sword fell, he would dash forward. That was his decision.
Twang!
He heard the sound of a string snapping and a bolt flew, lodging into his left shoulder. A soldier had fired a crossbow, taking advantage of Enkrid’s distraction. Enkrid grunted briefly, enduring the pain, and spoke.
“Ugh, so dirty.”
“Thanks for the compliment.”
The mustached man said, sword in hand. There was no hint of a smile. Even if he killed the soldier in front of him, the tide of the battle would turn against them. A soldier’s life versus the outcome of the battle.
Even an eight-year-old child passing by would know which was more valuable. But letting him live was not an option either.
Swish.
The sword came down. A heavy, strong strike. Enkrid did not close his eyes. He watched the descending sword until the end. The Heart of the Beast gave him courage.
Without blinking, Enkrid thought.
‘If my body were normal, how would I block this?’
Until the very end, he focused on handling the sword. And just before the sword struck his forehead.
“Argh!”
A soldier’s scream came from behind. At the same time, a dark shadow struck the mustached man’s sword.
Bang!
Enkrid couldn’t see what the shadow was but he knew it wasn’t a sword or an arrow. If it were, it wouldn’t twist in the air and land on the ground.
“...Huh?”
Enkrid identified the shadow. Blue eyes, black fur like silk.
It was a black panther.
At that moment, a distant memory surfaced. It wasn’t too long ago, but repeated "todays" made it seem far away. A memory that could have been forgotten.
But it wasn’t.
Seeing the black fur and blue eyes, the memory resurfaced. It was the beast he encountered in the tall grass.
“You?”
“Grrr.”
The black panther had grown since then, its body slightly larger. It glared at the mustached man and let out a fierce roar.
“Another one?”
The mustached man raised his eyebrows in disbelief, then erupted in fury. Two crossbowmen aimed at the panther and fired.
“Oh, hey!”
Enkrid shouted in surprise. The panther twisted its body fluidly on the spot, dodging the bolts with a few agile leaps. Then it sprinted forward with a powerful push off the ground.
The mustached man instinctively brought his sword down. The panther didn’t go near him. It moved like a streak of black silk. It was that fast. The panther’s target was the crossbowmen.
“Argh!”
The panther’s claws were so sharp that a single swipe at the Achilles’ tendon of a crossbowman’s ankle sent blood spraying. Leather boots were no match for its claws.
Clang!
As the panther lunged, a soldier drew his short sword. The panther displayed an even more astonishing maneuver. Instead of targeting the soldier, it kicked the crossbow with its paw.
Springing off the ground with its front paws, it snapped the crossbow string with its rear claws. It then stomped on the crossbow, sending it flying. Even in mid-air, it continued to snap the crossbow strings with its front claws.
‘Was it aiming for that?’
One could be a coincidence, but cutting the strings of all five remaining crossbows couldn’t be considered a coincidence.
“A mere beast.”
The mustached man’s face turned red with anger. He was truly furious now. The panther ignored him. It quickly dashed back to Enkrid and grabbed him by the scruff of his neck.
“Grrr!”
For some reason, the panther snorted in annoyance and started running. Its strength was incredible. Despite being dragged, Enkrid moved as fast as if he were running himself. His back ached, and he got scratches on his limbs in real-time. Being dragged along, he felt a warm liquid flowing from his neck. He wanted to turn his head to check, but there was no time.
“Chase them!”
The mustached man shouted. Even this wouldn’t be enough to escape here.
“Run.”
Enkrid said. Naturally, the panther didn’t reply. Warm liquid continued to flow from his neck, and the mustached man pursued. Enkrid, dragged by the panther, scraped along the ground in retreat. Even so, this escape had its limits. The panther’s limits were clear.
The mustached man showed no intention of letting them go. His bloodshot eyes were filled with determination.
“Run, I said.”
Enkrid repeated, and a black shadow appeared overhead.
“I’m here to save you.”
“Huh?”
Unexpected reinforcements. It was an ally drenched in blood. Someone he recognized, someone he once teased relentlessly.
“Vengeance?”
“Yes. I’m here.”
He stood in front of Enkrid, sword in hand. He wasn’t alone. Allied soldiers gathered behind him. A platoon had pushed forward and reached here.
Enkrid’s, or rather, the panther’s delay hadn’t been in vain.
Chapter 45: Enduring Countless Battles (1)
"Come at me!"
Platoon Leader Vengeance shouted, swinging his sword down. The mustached man held his sword horizontally, blocking the strike in the middle.
Platoon Leader Vengeance's and the mustached man's swords clashed.
Clang!
As the swords collided, the mustached man stepped forward, using his weight to push his opponent backwards.
Vengeance, focused solely on swinging his sword, was helplessly thrown backward.
"Ugh!"
Losing his balance, he rolled back and forth, raising a cloud of dust where he stopped, right next to Enkrid.
Platoon Leader Vengeance and Enkrid's eyes met. A brief silence hung between them. A cold wind blew from somewhere. Vengeance's face turned bright red.
Enkrid chose his words carefully.
"...You said you came to save me."
Vengeance's pupils shook violently.
"Why is that bastard so strong?"
Enkrid let out a helpless laugh. He came to save him, yet he got knocked out in one hit. Vengeance rolled over and stood up, grabbing his fallen sword and taking his stance again.
"Damn it, you bastard."
He glared at the enemy and shouted.
"Shoot!"
Half of Vengeance's platoon were archers.
"Shoot them all!"
At his command, arrows flew.
"Block it!"
"Raise your shields!"
Several soldiers following closely behind the mustached man rushed forward, raising their shields.
Thud, thud, thud!
Arrows struck the shields. Their timing was perfect. Peeking over the shield, the mustached man glared at Enkrid with murderous intent. Then he snatched a shield from one of his subordinates.
This crazy bastard.
Enkrid gritted his teeth and stood up abruptly. A burning pain shot through his leg and his back where the bolts were embedded. There was no time to groan.
Growl.
The panther bared its fangs beside him. Meanwhile, the shield which the mustached man held closed the distance quickly.
"Crazy bastard!"
Vengeance shouted in surprise. Enkrid endured the pain and drew the shortsword from Vengeance's waist.
Clang.
The mustached man was right in front of him. Retreating wasn’t an option.
Whoosh.
Vengeance swung his sword diagonally to intercept the opponent's strike, intending to halt the charge with force. The mustached man pretended to clash swords, but twisted his wrist, pulling back his sword and diverting Vengeance's blow.
Swish.
Vengeance's sword sliced through empty air. Meanwhile, the panther sprang forward. The mustached man wasn't like an ordinary soldier. He angled his shield downwards, blocking the panther's path and pushing it aside.
"Yelp!"
The panther let out a cry as it was thrown to the side. All this happened within mere seconds. Enkrid, gripping the shortsword, channeled his concentration. Soon, only he and his opponent remained in his mind.
Focus Point.
The injuries, the relief, the emotional shifts all brought forth heightened concentration. Time seemed to slow down for a moment. Enkrid saw the bloodshot eyes of the mustached man. At the same time, he saw the opponent's hands.
The mustached man gripped just above the pommel, extending the reach to deliver a single, decisive slash. In that stance, he swung his sword in an arc, from above to below.
Enkrid didn't even realize when the sword had been raised, but now it was coming down. The blade descended like a guillotine. It felt like the mustached man's blade was urging him to repeat today.
Enkrid didn’t like that.
He held his breath. There was no time to exhale. No time to whimper about the pain. He had learned heavy swordsmanship, but he couldn’t rely on the basics he learned from Ragna now.
So then.
Out of the dozens of sword techniques he had learned, practiced, seen, and mimicked, which could he use now?
Countless defeats had led to endless study and practice. Always learning and observing. His body moved instinctively. The shortsword was weak against impact. If he blocked with force, it would shatter. The mustached man was confident of his victory. He believed he would take the life of the annoying foe in front of him.
Whoosh. Ting, screeech. Thud!
In the end, the mustached man's strike failed. He only managed to cut Enkrid’s shoulder. The wound was deep, and blood spurted out, but he wasn’t dead. He had failed to kill him.
"You..."
Instead of attacking again, the mustached man's eyes widened in surprise. His eyes were filled with disbelief.
"Where did you learn that?"
The mustached man shouted. Enkrid answered honestly.
"From fighting."
Mitch Hurrier had demonstrated the flowing technique countless times in front of Enkrid. His technique was truly exquisite. In a dangerous moment, it had unconsciously emerged.
As the mustached man's sword came down, Enkrid had deflected it with the shortsword, diverting it to the side. He had intercepted the middle of the blade, absorbing the force and loosening his grip to let it slide away.
Distribution of the force and timing, everything had to be perfect for it to work. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have just ended up with a shoulder wound. Enkrid was surprised himself.
‘It worked.’
Though he had seen and studied it countless times, this was the first time he had used it in practice. Without any rigorous training, the technique had succeeded. It was a miracle for someone like Enkrid, who was notoriously talentless.
For the first time, Enkrid’s heart raced. The flowing sword technique he used was something even well-trained swordsmen struggled to imitate.
"You bastard!"
Behind the mustached man, Vengeance swung his sword and charged again. The mustached man turned, parrying Vengeance's sword and raising his shield again.
Thud!
An arrow lodged in the shield. A skilled archer had aimed for him, but he blocked it.
Clang! Clang!
In that place, the mustached man exchanged a few more strikes with Vengeance. He glared at Enkrid with fiery eyes. Enkrid was only staring at the shortsword in his hand. He couldn’t rush to kill him again. If he stayed stuck here, they’d all be doomed. The mustached man turned.
"Retreat!"
He shouted and withdrew. As he did, he made one final remark to Enkrid.
"I won’t forget you."
Enkrid replied sincerely.
"You don’t have to."
He meant it. What good would remembering him do?
Vengeance's platoon didn't chase too far. Even at the forefront, they were far ahead of their own troops. If they advanced further, Vengeance's platoon might get annihilated in a counterattack.
"Hey, your shoulder!"
Vengeance had been glaring at the retreating mustached man, but now he returned to check on Enkrid. Blood was streaming down his shoulder. He had deflected and diverted the blow, but it wasn’t perfect.
Still, Enkrid smiled.
‘It worked.’
He repeated the words he had thought when the technique succeeded earlier. He tried to recall how he had diverted the opponent’s sword, but couldn’t remember clearly. His body had moved on its own. He was filled with exhilaration. It was a new feeling.
"This isn’t the time to smile, you madman."
Vengeance approached and wrapped a cloth around Enkrid's shoulder.
"We have no bandages! We’re retreating now. Fall back to the 3rd Platoon!"
Vengeance ordered his platoon to fall back. They had already won this battle. The company commander had instructed them to pursue the enemy's rear but not too deeply. Having been severely affected by the sorcery, they needed to regroup too.
"You've lost too much blood."
Vengeance said, supporting Enkrid. Enkrid looked at Vengeance and spoke.
"We need to take the panther too."
They had saved each other's lives. He couldn’t leave it behind now.
"You crazy bastard, worry about yourself first."
Despite his words, Vengeance picked up the fallen panther. He checked for injuries and saw blood dripping from its teeth.
'So that's what was running down my back.'
Despite bleeding from its gums, it hadn’t let go of him. Enkrid cradled the panther in his arms. It wasn’t heavy. How had such a small body produced such strength?
Whimper.
The panther whimpered in his arms.
"Let's go!"
Then Vengeance supported Enkrid as they left the battlefield.
From that point, Enkrid was half-conscious. He had lost too much blood. The ferryman of the black river appeared in the air and asked.
"Hey, why do you go to such lengths?"
He was hallucinating due to the blood loss. He couldn’t muster the strength to answer, so he stared at the ferryman, who continued.
"You can just start over."
"It repeats endlessly, countless times."
"Why go to such lengths?"
"What's wrong with living carelessly if today will just repeat?"
"Settle down, stop, hone yourself, and face today again. If you die, you can start a more perfect today."
"Is it the fear of death? No, you’ll get used to it. What’s wrong with letting go of your sanity halfway? Who's watching? Who cares? Today is solely for you."
Enkrid had no energy to speak. He couldn’t walk properly, half-dragged now. So, he answered internally.
Why should I settle?
Just because it repeats, because there’s another chance, why wouldn’t I give it my all today?
If I keep repeating, there will be a stagnant me.
Living like that, I’d be trapped in today.
And just like that, there would be no tomorrow.
Without tomorrow, there are no dreams. Without dreams, it’s meaningless.
‘I don’t want to stop.’
Even if each step was a fraction of what others took. He wanted to move forward. That’s how he wanted to live. Even if he couldn’t become a knight, he wanted to struggle to become one.
Thud.
He lacked the strength to walk and stumbled over a rock.
"Don’t die."
Vengeance mumbled right next to his ear. His vision blurred. He couldn’t see clearly. At some point, the ferryman of the black river disappeared. Enkrid realized the nature of this curse.
"I could do better if I started again, couldn’t I?"
This thought would inevitably come as he repeated today.
But not for Enkrid.
He always wanted to walk towards tomorrow. Instinctively, he knew that a failed tomorrow was better than a perfect today.
‘Settling means the end.’
That’s why this is a curse, not a blessing. Repeating today endlessly would mean never seeing the next day. At the end of his thoughts, Enkrid asked himself.
‘So, was this the best?’
He didn’t know. Only the gods knew what a perfect today looked like. The "today" Enkrid lived was partly luck. There was no guarantee that luck would be present in the next "today."
So, as always, he would walk towards tomorrow. A warm body was nestled in his arms. With blurred vision, he looked down to see the black panther staring at him.
Its blue eyes were like a lake.
And Enkrid lost consciousness.
He thought he might die. Then he would repeat today again. He wouldn’t be discouraged by failing to reach tomorrow. He would struggle to live once more.
Darkness came and enveloped Enkrid. He became a wanderer invited to the world of darkness, losing consciousness.
"Did I make the wrong choice?"
The ferryman of the black river appeared. Enkrid heard his soliloquy.
He turned his head. The ferryman’s smooth, black mirror-like face was still there.
"Let’s see."
His single remark brought Enkrid back to consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he saw the tent ceiling.
"Wow, you survived? I really thought you’d die this time."
Rem's voice was heard.
His shoulder, back, leg, and side were all hurt and his head felt dizzy.
"The cut on your shoulder was serious. I don't know who did it, but it was a clean cut."
Rem continued to chatter. Enkrid, who had been half out of it, blinked a few times.
He then realized there was warmth beside him and reached out. A dull pain throbbed from his shoulder. He felt soft fur under his hand.
"Grrr."
The black panther purred contentedly at the touch.
‘I made it through today.’
"You’re making a habit of fainting."
"Who faints because they want to? I’m thirsty."
"Really?"
Enkrid saw Rem sitting with his arms crossed. Standing behind him was Big Eyes. Big Eyes brought water. A few sips moistened his parched throat like rain on dry ground.
"Wow, our Squad Leader is tough. Look, he's alive."
Big Eyes said, watching him drink.
"He lost a lot of blood."
Jaxon said nonchalantly. At the back, a squad member deep into his religion prayed.
"Lord, we offer gratitude for answering our prayers."
Ragna quietly watched him and spoke.
"Are you alright?"
"It’s not bad enough to die."
He could say that because he had survived. He could say that because he had lived through today and faced tomorrow.
Enkrid smiled modestly and laid back down.
Chapter 46: Enduring Countless Battles (2)
Enkrid was told that a healer had visited, who treated his various puncture and stab wounds.
“Luckily, there will be no permanent damage. Our Squad Leader is fortunate,” Big Eyes said with a grin.
"You sound like you were hoping I'd get hurt."
"No, I’m just worried. You should feel honored. You're the first man I've ever worried about."
"Alright then."
Enkrid had thought they would retreat soon, but the troops were still in a standoff with the Azpen Kingdom.
Would there be more battles?
Regardless, it wouldn’t involve Enkrid. Returning to the battlefield with his current injuries was out of the question. Maybe he'd just observe.
Big Eyes had left him an apple, which Enkrid was munching on when Rem entered. The rest of the squad had left the tent, so they were alone. Rem sat next to Enkrid, resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands. He stared at Enkrid with his lips firmly closed.
“If you're going to confess, let me reject you first.”
“You know I like women, right? If you and a woman I'd never met before were both drowning, I'd save the woman. Of course, assuming she's pretty.”
“It’s okay. I swim well. Don’t bother saving me, I’ll manage on my own.”
“Then you can save me next time. Turns out, I’m not a great swimmer.”
What was he thinking, saying he’d save a drowning woman then?
Enkrid found it very typical of Rem.
"Sure, I'll throw you a rock."
Their usual banter continued until Rem fell silent and just stared at Enkrid. His gray eyes locked on Enkrid without a flicker, filled with an unprecedented seriousness.
"Do you have something to say?"
“How did you know it was sorcery?”
Huh? Enkrid hadn’t expected that question here.
"I saw it during a scouting mission."
“You figured it was sorcery just from that? You seemed to know the flagpole was the target.”
That was true. He had known. But he couldn't say he had learned it by repeating today. He needed a plausible excuse. He was about to fabricate a lie but felt uneasy under Rem's scrutinizing gray eyes. Even if he told the truth, Rem wouldn’t believe him. But should he lie outright?
A clumsy lie would be easily spotted. Enkrid didn't want to treat Rem that way. So, he mixed in some truth.
“I once lived with a pioneer.”
That was true since Rem himself was a pioneer.
“I learned a lot from that friend.”
That was also true since Rem had told him about sorcery.
“So, I thought about it and guessed.”
This wasn’t entirely true, but it was close enough. Instead of guessing, he had learned by repeating today and figuring it out physically. One could say he thought with his body instead of his mind. At least, that's what Enkrid believed as he spoke.
“It seemed like the flagpole was the medium for the sorcery. I saw the enemy's formation acting strangely before the fog appeared, and then I charged.”
“Hmm.”
People are easily deceived when a lie is mixed with truth. This is because the speaker genuinely believes what they’re saying. When sincerity is involved, even a sharp-witted person struggles to find the falsehood.
Enkrid spoke with sincerity, omitting only what couldn’t be said.
Rem believed him. Even if he didn’t fully believe, there was no room for doubt.
“That’s how it was? It’s impressive that you figured it out so quickly.”
“If it’s sorcery, so what?”
“I wanted to tell you not to mess with it recklessly.”
“Is that so?”
Rem nodded. Enkrid remembered that Rem had been absent during the battle. He had expected Rem to come to his location when they charged, but he hadn’t. He hadn’t seen him since. Then he had returned to the unit.
“I want to ask where you went during the battle.”
“It was nothing. I was curious who set up that flagpole, so I went to check it out.”
“...You checked it out?”
“Yeah, and had a chat with my axe.”
Rem grinned and left the tent. Enkrid recalled the moment he had toppled the flagpole. The sorcerer had been ringing bells but quickly disappeared. He hadn’t paid much attention as he was focused on destroying the flag. Apparently, the sorcerer had fled and ran into Rem’s axe. Enkrid decided it wasn’t a big deal.
Rem’s impulsive actions were nothing new. In a previous battle, he had charged into the enemy lines, claiming he was going to capture a "hawk’s talon" or something.
The platoon leader, knowing this, had excluded the troublemaking squad from the main force. Only the remaining squad was counted as part of the platoon’s strength.
This time was no different.
However, there was something unusual. This time, Enkrid had left the formation first. That was unusual.
“Hey, you alright?”
The platoon leader entered the tent.
“Are you visiting the sick? When are we returning?”
Enkrid asked abruptly. The platoon leader shrugged.
“There’s no order from above yet. We’re all on standby.”
Winter was approaching. It was a difficult season for continued fighting. While they wouldn’t leave this outpost entirely unmanned, their battalion had fought hard in this battle, so they would likely be relieved soon.
That there was no return order yet was strange. The platoon leader scratched his head as he looked at Enkrid.
“You.”
“Yes.”
The platoon leader hadn’t thought much of Enkrid’s departure at the time. He had only wondered if Enkrid had finally lost it. Later, he had survived by following the orders to get down and raise shields. When he thought he was done for in the fog, it suddenly cleared.
They had turned and fought the enemy. He later heard that the fog was sorcery, which wouldn’t dissipate unless the medium was destroyed or the sorcerer was killed. He had heard all this from the company commander.
“Who could have done it?”
The company commander had asked, staring at him with green eyes. The platoon leader had thought of Enkrid’s name then.
At the very least, he suspected that squad had done something. After all, Enkrid had charged out before the fog appeared. And the shouts had sounded like Enkrid’s voice.
The platoon leader, gathering his thoughts, spoke.
“They say that fog was sorcery.”
“Yes, I reported that.”
Right. Enkrid had reported it during a reconnaissance mission.
“Hmm. Right.”
The platoon leader looked at Enkrid for a moment, then told him to take care and left.
‘It makes no sense.’
He knew Enkrid’s skill level. He wasn’t the worst, but at best, he could lead a village militia. While there were formidable soldiers in his squad, Enkrid wasn’t one of them. The medium for sorcery would be deep within enemy lines, unless the enemy were fools. Someone would have had to infiltrate that deep.
‘Through that thick fog?’
Dodging bolts and arrows?
The troublemaker squad leader?
Impossible.
He had even asked Rem just in case, but Rem had denied it. Ragna was out of the question. He had been fighting beside them once the fog cleared. The remaining squad members had been fighting as part of the rear platoon formation.
‘Did reinforcements come from the main force?’
Thinking this, the platoon leader stepped outside. The temperature had dropped sharply, and the cold had set in.
“Are we really not retreating?”
He longed for the city’s air. He missed his home, his wife, and his daughter. He wanted to roast potatoes by the fire and sleep soundly.
After two days in bed, Enkrid was able to get up and move around.
“Don’t overdo it.”
Big Eyes was worried, but Enkrid’s condition was better than expected.
“Is that beast gone?”
Big Eyes asked. Enkrid, sitting up in bed, nodded and looked around.
