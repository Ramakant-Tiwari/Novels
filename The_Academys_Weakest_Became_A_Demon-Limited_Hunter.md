Chapter 1: - Possessed the Weakest
==================================

༺ **Possessed the Weakest** ༻

*Dawn.*

*Roaring thunder.*

The sound of rain clashing against the pavement echoed.

I settled down while being curled up in the open draped curtain.

Raindrops slid down the translucent veil, seeming to become one with the
window as they froze.

I kept staring at the scene endlessly.

“Aahh.”

Three days. It was already the third day.

No matter how much thought I tried to put into it, I have somehow
transmigrated into the game ❰Magical Knight of Märchen❱, a game which I
had been playing for the past 7 years.

Even worse, it was as a third-rate extra who had nothing to do with
either the hero or any of the other main characters.

It truly was an obvious cliché.

I don’t even know whether or not I’m in a stable period right now.

It was all too vague.

Being suddenly dropped back to the start of my student life, when I saw
the piles of books stacked taller than my own height, I felt a sense of
dread and hopelessness.

Perhaps this was a punishment.

I had wanted to re-experience the story after ignoring it for a long
time. Not wanting to bother with grinding, I went ahead and tried to
leisurely start a new game after applying the stat 100 cheat code, the
only one that works in the game.

Being a hard-core veteran, I definitely shouldn’t have done that…

‘That’s probably why I transmigrated.’

***Haha, that would be crazy.***

I’m really starting to think of all sorts of things.

However, it was an undeniable fact that I have transmigrated into ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

After living in this world for the past three days, I was able to
confirm that this was the Märchen Academy that I had seen in the game.

And that today is the day of the entrance ceremony, the event that
marked the beginning of the game for the player.

I found out the time and place for the ceremony thanks to the date being
posted on the entrance ceremony banner and the dormitory calendar, both
of which have been mostly hidden behind the main gate.

When I first opened my eyes in the student dormitory.

I used the academy’s own currency, which I received as a freshman
benefit, to pay for my meals.

Other than that, I did nothing but wander around in silence day after
day.

With how realistic it all felt, I had no choice but to accept this
absurd reality…

In addition, I had gained the ability to use magic by manipulating mana
with my senses. This \[Ice Curtain\] I’m using as an umbrella was proof
of that.

Well… it’s not exactly a funny situation I’ve found myself in.

As I was lost in my own thoughts while absentmindedly listening to the
sound of rain, I suddenly realized something terrible.

‘This is… it’s Hell-level difficulty, isn’t it?’

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ begins with a selection of three different
difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. You can choose the ‘Extreme’
difficulty after beating the game once, and the infamous ‘Hell’
difficulty after beating the game a second time.

The game’s atmosphere in ‘Hell’ difficulty changes dramatically from the
start.

Today was supposed to be a clear and sunny day from start to finish, as
usual. It was a good day to mark the beginning of the main character,
Ian Fairytale’s, chaotic life at the academy.

The refreshing music playing in the background and bright atmosphere of
that time were still etched in my memory to this day.

However, if you were to select Hell difficulty instead, the game begins
with heavy downpour and gloomy weather.

I still remember just how gloomy the beginning of the ‘Hell’ difficulty
was, with the opening cutscenes being void of any kind of background
music and only the sound of rain remaining. It was almost as if it was
foreshadowing the difficult road ahead.

And it was in this difficulty that Ian is forced to fight an enemy
before the entrance ceremony even began.

‘Even though I got transmigrated…’

Hell difficulty, as its name would suggest, boasted an insane difficulty
level.

It was natural for the enemies’ level to randomly increase or for their
pattern to become more complex, and with the story itself being changed
as well, enemies that had never appeared in any of the previous
difficulty settings make an appearance every now and then.

It was a challenge that only the most hardcore of veterans could
overcome.

‘But I…\`

When I tried to check the status window, a translucent window suddenly
materialized in front of me. It was an interface that I had seen often
in fantasy games.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 20

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman

**Mana:** 280 / 300– Mana Recovery Speed (D-)

– Stamina (D-)

– Strength (D)

– Intelligence (D)

– Willpower (B) Potential ❰❰Details❱❱ \[Combat Skills\] **Elemental
Series 1: Ice**

– Elemental Firepower (D-)

– Elemental Efficiency (D)

– Elemental Synergy (C)

– Elemental Series 2 (Locked) \[Owned Skills\] **Active**

– (★1) Ice Generation (D)

– (★2) Ice Curtain(C)

– (★1) Cold Divergence (C)

– (★1) Basic Protection Magic (E)

**Passive**

– None Skill Tree ❰❰Details❱❱ \[Unique Attributes\] – None

Even for a third-rate extra, these were disastrous stats.

First and foremost, my level was at a measly 20. The average level of
freshmen, from what I can recall, was around 40 at this time. Other than
a few exceptions, the present students should all be in this category.

In this game, Level 20 was the level that you would get during the
Hell-difficulty version of the tutorial. However, it was too low.

Even if my willpower stat is high, it will only end up increasing my
resistance to Illusion-type magic. It’s not a stat that would be of much
help in combat.

‘What kind of life did this guy lead to not even be at the basic level?’

The same goes for my skills. Considering that the worst grade is E, it’s
easy to guess just how garbage the level of my \[Elemental Firepower\]
D-grade is, which is directly responsible for the power of my skills.

Just how did a trivial character such as this manage to make it into
somewhere as prestigious as the Märchen Academy?

If I were to think back to how difficult the contents of this game were,
it was an obvious conclusion to make that I had passed the overwhelming
entrance exam with my theoretical skills, rather than my practical
skills.

If that was the case, then what was I supposed to do now? No matter how
hard I tried to recall this body’s memories, my head remained blank.

Rather than the past, I now had to worry about my plans for the future.

I still didn’t know if I would ever be able to return to my own world
later on, or if I would have to live here for the rest of my life.

The worst case scenario was if the world had a bad ending as a result of
the death of the main character, Ian Fairytale, and I died along with
everyone else.

***So, under the assumption that I can’t return to my own world, what
would be the safest countermeasure to take?***

Of course, it would be to clear this game.

‘It’s lucky that the cheat is still valid…’

After thoroughly checking the status window for the past 3 days, I was
able to confirm that the stat 100 cheat had been applied to me as is.

While it has no direct effect on my stats, it can be used to invest in
my potential growth.

Therefore, it was difficult to expect dramatic effects right away.

The main problem is that this ‘Isaac’ character not only had terrible
specs but awful growth potential as well…

‘… \[Ice Generation\].’

The ball of ice that had just been created mid-air with my mana was only
the size of a soccer ball. It was the result created by squeezing out
every ounce of mana I have in order to make a single block of ice.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

Once I finally released the mana holding the ice-sphere in place, the
physics-defying mass could no longer resist the force of gravity and
immediately fell to the ground.

***…Really, really weak.***

Why didn’t I create the ice using the liquids inside of another person’s
body in combat, you ask? Sadly enough, it was simply not possible. This
game had a setting where it was impossible to generate any form of magic
within another person’s body because of an inherent ‘mana force field’
that all living beings have.

To put it simply, my only power was the ability to drop ice cubes.

Knowing that, I now needed to make sure with my own two eyes before
doing anything.

***Is the main character, Ian Fairytale, capable enough to get through
this hellish difficulty appropriately on his own?***

-   ～●～●～●～

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ had a new boss fight at the start of the game
exclusive to the hell difficulty, ‘Trevion the Evil’.

He is supposed to meet the main character today, just before the
entrance ceremony begins.

In the future, the main character, Ian Fairytale, will end up facing
countless enemies. It was a result of the special powers that Ian holds.

‘The rain has stopped.’

The time has come.

I took a glance over at the clock tower placed in the center of the
academy.

Right now, the time is 8:00 AM. The sunlight was finally pouring through
the cracks of the gradually receding dark clouds.

I immediately began heading into the ‘Josena Forest’ that was located
just outside the Academy’s main gate, while reliving my past memories of
playing the game to find my way.

After climbing up the hill, I would be able to find a small dormitory
where the main character, Ian Fairytale, had stayed for a period of time
while traveling to the Märchen Academy. Ian is supposed to leave the
dormitory today, finally making his way towards the academy.

My destination was a glade that would appear midway through a forest
trail lined with trees. It was the place where Ian was supposed to be
while on his way to the academy.

‘It’s here… !’

I stopped in my tracks the moment I reached my destination.

A black-haired man could be seen leaning against a tree, his head facing
downwards.

He was dressed similarly to me, and a stream of blood leaked down his
chin.

Seeing his oh-so-familiar face, I was immediately able to recognize who
he was.

Ian Fairytale. He was the main protagonist of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

\[Ian Fairytale\] **Lv:** 30

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Light

**Danger:** X

An information window suddenly materialized and identified the
black-haired man before me as Ian Fairytale, confirming my suspicions.

After having completed the tutorial in Hell-difficulty, your level will
be automatically set to 30. The main character, who had been knocked out
over there, seemed to have already finished the tutorial.

And standing before the fainted protagonist was a dark-skinned man.

The limbs of the dark-skinned man were eerily limp. His hands, both of
which appeared nearly bent in their opposite directions, were twisted.

Pure white, curly hair. The infamous first boss that had driven
countless players into the depths of despair right from the start of the
Hell difficulty.

\[Trevion the Evil\] **Lv:** 80

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Water

**Danger:** High

It was ‘Trevion the Evil’.

‘Level 80… It’s Hell difficulty for sure.’

Appearing right after starting the game, is the enemy who can see into
the future, Trevion the Evil. He was level 80 on Hell difficulty.

On the other hand, Ian’s level was a pitiful 30. In his current state,
if Ian were to get a direct hit from just one light attack from Trevion,
he’ll immediately fall into a moribund state like right now, and if he
were to get hit by a second attack, he’ll die instantly.

As a result of the ‘Hell’ difficulty, the enemy level was extremely
high. Even after defeating it, the amount of experience gained wasn’t
much more than the other difficulties.

The development team’s gloomy intention for players to not even consider
beginning the Hell difficulty without already having a high level of
control seemed excessive.

It doesn’t make sense when coming from a plot standpoint for the current
Ian to be able to defeat Trevion.

Eventually, in the middle of the fight, Kaya Astrean, the ‘Second seat’
of the ‘Freshmen Class Magic Department’, would make an appearance and
subdue the enemy herself.

So in the end, the goal in this fight was to keep ‘holding on’.

***By the way…***

‘Ian, just what are you doing at a time like this?’

***Did you run out of stamina right away?***

***It can’t be. Please no…***

***Of course, the Hell difficulty requires an amount of control only
attainable after training until you feel like dying from the very
beginning, but even so, this is not…***

Trevion slowly began to approach the currently knocked-out Ian. Black
orbs of water floated in the palm of each of his hands. It was a type of
magic that combined the two elements of darkness and water.

…And so, from the first day of the entrance ceremony, this world was
already on the verge of a bad ending.

‘What would happen to me if I were to die here?’

***What will happen to me when there is a bad ending? Would I be sent
back to reality, or… do I die permanently?***

…Ominous. I had no idea what to do to salvage this situation.

The only thing most likely to guarantee my safety is to clear this game.

At the end of the story, it is said that Ian became a magic knight and
went on to win countless wars.

Furthermore, as Märchen Academy is the most prestigious academy on the
continent, you could easily live in this world with just one of their
diplomas.

However, in order to do that, you must first defeat the final boss,
‘Nephid the Evil God’.

Naturally, this game couldn’t be completed without the help of that
unconscious bastard with the so-called title of the main character.

***Let’s hurry up and try to think of a solution. Now, the best way to
solve this crisis is…?***

‘Oh, the Cheat.’

The 100 Stat Bonus cheat!

I quickly opened the status window and clicked on the Potential
❰❰Details❱❱ section.

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 100 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (D+): 16/100 \[UP\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (D-): 10/100 \[UP\]

– Learning Efficiency (D): 12/100 \[UP\] ◈ Elemental Resistance – Fire

– Lightning Resistance (C): 29/100 \[UP\]

– Rock Resistance (E): 2/100 \[UP\]

– Wind Resistance (D): 13/100 \[UP\]

– Neutral Magic Resistance (D): 8/100 \[UP\] ◈ vs. Race Combat Power –
vs. Human Combat Power (E): 4/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Other Races Combat Power (E): 1/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Demon Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

The 100 stat bonus cheat I had entered a while back was successfully
applied without any problems.

The \[UP\] button was active for each potential because there were stat
points available.

The potential that already had points allocated by default seemed to be
innate to Isaac himself.

Anyway, ignoring everything else, I immediately poured all of my stat
points into \[vs. Demon Combat Power\].

*Trringgggg-♪*

\[Potential \[vs. Demon Combat Power\] has been improved from E-class to
S-class!\] \[You have acquired the unique trait \[Hunter\]!\] \[vs.
Demon Combat Power Highest Level. This gave you the unique trait
‘Hunter’\].

It was only natural to put everything into this particular potential in
this situation. That’s because of its effect of temporarily increasing
stats when dealing with demons.

As a matter of fact, nearly all of the official villains in ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱ are demons. Therefore, the more you invest in \[vs.
Demon Combat Power\], the more specialized you become in boss battles.

And \[Hunter\] is a unique trait that is only obtainable after fully
maxing out \[vs. Demon Combat Power\]. It is a trait that vastly
enhances the effectiveness of \[vs. Demon Combat Power\].

As a result, I will be able to exert overwhelming strength when fighting
against demons like Trevion from now on.

Finally prepared, I headed into the open space.

Then, as Trevion approached Ian, he finally noticed my presence and
directed his gaze toward me.

“…….”

\[……\]

Dark purple eyes. A human-esque face. An elongated body that looked as
if it had been stretched out. The moment he spotted me, he grinned wide
enough to tear apart the corners of his lips. Frankly speaking, it was a
bizarre appearance.

^1^AI made

\[Hello?\]

Trevion’s head twitched as he greeted me with a squeaky voice.

It was because of this particular trait that many players had given him
a nickname. It was ‘Hello-man’.

Trevion was a demon that can only say ‘Hello’.

***\[Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello?\]***

He swayed back and forth and suddenly approached me with frightening
speed!

Without any time to hesitate, I stretched out my right hand towards
Trevion. It was a traditional stance for using magic.

What kind of effect will it have? Fear and anticipation intertwined as
they swirled within me.

Then, suddenly, my heart started beating strongly, as if it was gripped
by a vise.

My blood boiled, and the surrounding flow of mana grew intense.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\] \[Status\]
**Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** (120)

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman

**Mana:** (30000) / (30000)– Mana Recovery Speed (B+)

– Stamina (A-)

– Strength (A)

– Intelligence (D)

– Willpower (S)

‘Oh…‘

Levels and abilities… rose sharply.

Unlike before, it felt as if I had an unlimited amount of energy at my
disposal.

I willfully surrendered myself to that feeling.

Trevion swung his arms, causing a strange mana mixed with darkness and
water to begin spiraling in my direction.

At that moment, I released the cold air that had been flowing throughout
my body with my right hand.

A geometric pattern composed of a bright blue light manifested itself in
front of my outstretched right hand

Then, the cold magic exploded.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Baaaaaang——-!!*

“Woah!”

As if exploding from a cannon, a ball of ice burst straight out of my
hand and proceeded to devour Trevion’s magic!

The vast mana made up of ice spread outwards in a motion akin to a fan
all at once and overwhelmed the glade in an instant.

It easily swallowed up Trevion and then soared diagonally towards the
sky as if it were bouncing off the ground.

A huge block of ice formed in no time, looking like an incredibly
magnificent sculpture.

With the cold air blowing around it, that block of ice gave the illusion
of having been transported to the North or South Pole.

Trevion stood trapped in the block of ice with a painful expression as
if he had been frozen in time.

Fortunately, the main character, Ian Fairytale, was barely outside the
range of the ice block, so he had ended up suffering no damage from my
attack. It was probably because the ice ball had flown into the sky
before it reached him.

I heaved a deep sigh of relief, my breath visible in the cold air.

From the palm of my right hand, where the magic had come from just now,
pure white cold air was flowing out, similar to smoke leaking from a
pistol’s muzzle after firing a bullet.

Just a few moments ago, I was only able to make a block of ice the size
of a soccer ball…

On the other hand, the iceberg that had formed before my very eyes, with
various thorns poking out in every direction, was on a different level
entirely.

So this was the result of upgrading \[vs. Demon Combat Power\] to its
maximum level—–.

I vaguely sensed that it was possible to get rid of my magic’s aftermath
by releasing the mana holding it together. As if I had simply pressed a
button on a remote control, I naturally released the mana flowing
through the massive ice block.

As one would expect, the sharp and huge chunk of ice began cracking
apart.

*Craaack–.*

It broke down with an explosion of ice, suddenly turned into a light
blue-colored powder, and then started to be blown away by the breeze. I
guess you could say it was ‘freezing off’.

No longer frozen in ice, Trevion collapsed while covered in blood. His
wounds were formed from the countless ice shards aggressively flung at
him when the skill, \[Frost Explosion\] had occurred.

‘Is it fine…?’

It wouldn’t be an issue even if I had to fight any further. I thought I
could win with ease.

After a period of intense silence, Trevion collapsed on the ground while
still uttering the word.

\[Hello… Hel…\]

A powerless voice scattered in the wind.

As Trevion turned into ashen dust and faded away.

Chapter 2: - Mana Evaluation (1)
================================

༺ **Mana Evaluation (1)** ༻

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Trevion the Evil (Lv
80)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 25!\]
\[You have unlocked the achievement ❰Beginning of a Legend❱! You have
gained an additional 15 bonus stat points!\]

“Oh.”

A sudden increase of 5 levels all at once.

Also, along with every level up, each of my stats were increased by 2.
The rewards for achievements appear to have been awarded as it normally
would.

By the way, the overly-high level of the enemy just now was because of
this scenario being on the Hell-level difficulty setting. In other
words, even if the level difference between us was extreme, a wild
explosion in levels would not occur.

‘Looks like my mana has increased by 20—. Meanwhile, all of my other
stats are the same as before.’

A unique characteristic of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was that, unlike
most fantasy games, the player’s level-up didn’t have any kind of direct
effect to their stats.

Sure, the higher the level, the higher the limit of the character’s
stats were, but it was not a mechanic for me to concern myself with.

In the end, you needed to start training desperately if you wanted to
actually raise your stats.

The stat points that were accumulated from a level up can be invested in
a character’s ‘growth efficiency’, so as the game progressed, the stat
level began to curve upward.

Therefore, it could be said that Isaac’s stats would start to see a
sudden rise.

Putting that aside, another game mechanic was that the higher the
opponent’s level was, the less damage it would end up taking. However,
seeing as Trevion was only level 80 while I was level 120 at the time,
the damage I had given him seemed to have been fully applied.

‘Oh, does it also give party experience?’

I glanced at Ian, who was still knocked out on the ground.

A sudden increase of 1 level.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, allies who fought together in battle
received experience points according to their performance.

If the character was a damage dealer, it would be based on how much
damage they dealt, if the character was a healer, it would be based on
how much health they restored, and so on.

Additionally, the more characters in a party, the higher the total
amount of experience would be. Therefore, it wasn’t the type of system
where the experience points were split between party members.

It looks like the party experience system was the same as before, even
after the unpredictable event where I had gotten myself transmigrated
into this game.

‘The first bad ending has been prevented, and now–’

I should hurry up and head to the entrance ceremony.

The fact that I was still stuck in this world after three days no longer
fazed me. It was a necessity for me to properly face all of the events
that are going to happen in the future and to sort out each of them
myself.

‘–Oh, right. Kaya.’

Come to think of it, Kaya Astrean hadn’t shown up yet. Plot-wise, Kaya
Astrean was supposed to appear while Ian was in the middle of holding
out against Trevion.

I tried looking around but couldn’t sense or see her anywhere.

However—

When I thought about it more, it made sense. In the game, Kaya had only
appeared after Ian held on for a while.

But I had already killed Trevion in an instant. In other words, Kaya
must not have arrived here just yet.

‘I’m glad.’

I felt relieved that I didn’t get caught in the middle of the fight.

Had Kaya, the second seat of the entire freshman class, seen me
obliterate a level 80 demon in one attack– I couldn’t even imagine how
things would’ve turned out.

If I were to continue living within this world, I would have to prevent
any possible bad endings in the future. I shouldn’t have such a setback
in my plans this early on as a result of accidentally revealing my true
abilities.

First of all, I had ended up making a lot of noise when casting \[Frost
Explosion\]–, so it would be better to quickly get away from the scene
before I get noticed.

After sorting out my thoughts, I began walking back towards the Academy
for the entrance ceremony.

━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━

‘Wait, what?’

Kaya Astrean, who was currently hiding behind a tree, couldn’t keep her
mouth shut from shock.

While wandering around Josena Forest, she had suddenly sensed a dense
source of mana and quickly flew over with her wind magic.

Once she arrived, she saw that there was a confrontation between a
strange-looking demon and a single man.

To begin with, the random appearance of demons is normally considered to
be a natural disaster. There was nothing all that strange about the
sudden appearance of demons in a remote place like this.

Feeling the amount of mana he was emitting, it was clear that he was
quite a dangerous demon. But in that case, just what the hell was that
man who had slaughtered such a demon in an instant?

His appearance was that of a young male student with silver-blue hair
and a pair of crimson eyes which had a bluish aura attached. His height
seemed to be about average, and the overall impression he gave was cute.

However, the moment he fought, his eyes turned cold. It was a dramatic
shift in his atmosphere, akin to flipping one’s palm. It looked as if
the air surrounding him became freezing cold.

Sure enough, it was quite an impressive attack. \[Frost Explosion\], a
5-star ice spell. With that much power, it was clear that his skill
level was extremely high as well. Rather than feeling jealous, his skill
was at a level worthy of admiration.

Furthermore, at the moment when that man cast \[Frost Explosion\], Kaya
had sensed from him an amount of mana far greater than her own.

The amount of her mana was something that Kaya was particularly
confident in. She was so talented in that regard that she was admitted
to the Magic Department of the prestigious Märchen Academy as the second
seat in her class.

***But that guy— who the hell is he?***

‘Looking at his uniform, it looks like he’s a freshman like me—?’

He was clearly wearing the academy uniform. A silver-rimmed navy blue
cape was neatly draped over his shoulders, and the small brooch attached
to his tie was scattering the red light that symbolized the first grade.

At a glance, you could tell that he was a freshman like herself.

‘Could he be the ‘Top Seat’?’

Seeing the clear difference between them, Kaya suddenly realized that
she was a frog in a well.

The days when the people around her praised her while saying that she
was a genius born with magical talents flashed through her mind.

—A strong skepticism regarding those claims now engulfed her.

“Breathe-!”

She let out a gasp when she saw that the silver-haired man began to
move.

Kaya Astrean quickly turned around and crept behind a tree.

Her light green hair, tied to both sides into a twin-tail, fluttered for
a moment.

She had been holding her breath. Kaya found the man’s strength to be
terrifying.

The silver-haired man, on the other hand, leisurely left the glade, as
if he had never noticed her in the first place.

━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━

The entrance ceremony in reality was similar to the one in the game.

It took place in the middle of a sunny day after the heavy rain had
finally cleared up, while having the students gather up in an outdoor
plaza.

I took a seat among the other students on an ordinary chair. Thanks to
the faculty preparing the venue and installing a light barrier in
advance, the plaza was left untouched by the morning rain.

Standing behind the podium was Luce Eltania, the top seat holder of the
Magic Department’s freshman class, and Kaya Astrean, the second seat
beside her, who were currently in the middle of receiving their awards
together.

For some odd reason, Kaya was looking back and forth between the second
seat and the students sitting in the audience, wearing a suspicious
expression on her face. Was she still in shock from being in the second
seat rather than the first?

It was impossible to tell if that was originally the case, because the
faces of the first and the second seat were hidden in this cutscene, but
I never knew they could have that kind of expression. It felt fresh, in
a way.

Fortunately enough, The main character, Ian Fairytale, was able to
arrive at the entrance ceremony on time. Seeing how his physical
condition was intact, it was clear that Kaya Astrean had quickly healed
him with healing magic after I left the scene.

Thanks to his unique constitution, Ian could be healed to peak condition
just by casting a little bit of healing magic on him.

Then, after casually talking about this and that with his savior, he
would suddenly exclaim that he needs to get to the entrance ceremony as
soon as possible.

***By the way…***

‘I can’t believe that the main character is having this much trouble
from the get-go.’

An ominous feeling slowly crept down my spine–.

Although the main story hadn’t even started yet, Ian Fairytale had
already gotten his ass beat by Trevion the Evil.

In other words, it’s impossible to know whether he would be capable
enough to beat any of the numerous enemies that will appear in the
future.

With my soul having been transmigrated into this world, I have no idea
what kind of disastrous fate would befall me if Ian Fairytale were to
die and cause a bad ending to occur.

With all of this in mind, the most certain way for me to avoid an
untimely death is to go ahead and clear the main story of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱, while struggling through this hellish difficulty level to
prevent a bad ending.

‘It’s a bit of a complicated feeling, though–’

Alongside a feeling of anticipation, the fear of the unknown crept up as
well.

The feeling I had right now was similar to what I felt back when I had
bought up all of the stocks of a certain electronic company, in the
hopes that the stock price would end up rising to 100,000, all while the
price chart gradually continued to drop.

It was the kind of feeling that made me feel both anticipation and
anxiety at the same time, the kind that made me feel unable to move on
as I told myself things like, ‘It will rise again someday.’

━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━

The orientation for freshmen was scheduled to take place directly after
the entrance ceremony.

After checking the bulletin board inside the building’s entrance and
finding my name, ‘Isaac’, listed underneath the provisional 3rd class, I
began heading over to the lecture hall for the provisional 3rd class.

After playing through this game a countless number of times, I had
already become more than familiar with the layout of this vast and
sprawling Märchen Academy. Thanks to that, I was able to find the
lecture hall designated for the provisional 3rd class without any
issues.

It was a terraced lecture hall reminiscent of what you would find in a
university. Looking around, there were about 50 students who had already
taken their seats. Even then, around ten more seats will be filled in
the future as well. The Magic Department in this academy had a maximum
capacity of 300 students per grade, with a total of 5 provisional
classes each.

I roughly pushed my way through the crowd and sat down in one of the
seats in the center.

Ian Fairytale, the main character, still hadn’t arrived just yet, but
even then there were a couple of familiar faces I could spot.

\[Mateo Jordana\] **Lv:** 75

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

Mateo Jordana, who would end up playing the role of an early villain in
the story, acting as a stepping stone for Ian Fairytale’s development.
His brown bangs were greased back, revealing his clenched forehead,
which he paired with his muscular physique to make for an intimidating
figure.

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 71

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind

**Danger:** X

Then there was Tristan Humphrey, a vain aristocrat who had a hobby of
looking down on those he considered weak as well as the commoners he saw
as inferior. He was the typical blond-haired aristocrat who wore an
arrogant smirk on his lips at all times.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 90

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

The second seat of the freshman and one of the game’s heroines, Kaya
Astrean, was here as well. She gave a cute impression with two black
ribbons tied to her light green hair in the style of pigtails.

***– Wait, just why am I getting embarrassed now that we’re actually
face-to-face? Am I shy*?**

Anyways, Kaya Astrean had the personality of a kind-hearted and
broad-minded individual. Sure, there were some edges to her personality
here and there, but they were more like defense mechanisms she used to
hide her shyness and embarrassment.

She also tended to follow those she admired, like a lost puppy. She is
the number one type of girl who should be protected from pseudo-religion
propagandists at all cost.

She is also very good at making a mountain out of a molehill. She was a
cute heroine who would attach a deeper meaning to each and every action
Ian would make without putting much thought into them and would often
get excited on her own.

‘Woah.’

Having seen all of the characters from the game I always used to enjoy
in the flesh, my heart was strangely feeling overwhelmed all of a
sudden.

“Welcome, prospective wizards.”

Eventually, the front door of the lecture hall was opened and our
professor entered the room.

As he appeared, many of the female students started making various
exclamations like “Oh my–”, “Oh my God—”, and “So handsome–“.

The professor finally arrived in front of the podium amidst the
commotion, staring at the students with a chilling glare as he stood in
silence.

\[Fernando Frost\] **Lv:** 98

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Ice, Water

**Danger:** X

Unlike the silver-rimmed student uniform, the gold-rimmed navy blue
uniform was the attire that the academy professors would wear. His
well-groomed silver hair, blue eyes, and tall stature exuded the aura of
a professional.

Fernando Frost.

He was a cold individual who wore an emotionless poker face at all
times, as if not even a single drop of blood or tears existed within his
body.

In reality, however, he was a selfless humanitarian whose mind was
always on the safety of and concern for his students.

Thanks to this appealing character trait, he was ranked 5th in the
character popularity ranking of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Level 98. Although he was definitely at a higher level than most of his
students, as a wizard, it was around average. For reference, the level
of the characters in this setting was determined based on their direct
combat power. The level of their knowledge is also involved to a certain
extent, but in the end, the most important factor was their ability to
use magic well.

If the setting of the criteria for a character’s level was to be
theory-oriented instead, Fernando’s level would have been much higher.
In fact, that would be the case for most of the professors here.

“I am Professor Fernando Frost. I am the professor in charge of the
provisional 3rd class for this week.”

Professor Fernando said as such in a smooth, calm tone. The girls in the
class seemed to be dying because of the slick charm he possessed.

I’m sure he was aware of how handsome he was. This kind of reaction
would be normal for someone like him.

***– I envy him.***

“Let’s stop talking about any unrelated personal matters and just get
straight to the point. Orientation will be held over the course of the
next week. Then, when the class placement evaluation is completed and
the classes have been properly divided, the lessons will finally start
in earnest depending on the level of each class from then on.”

Professor Fernando continued to speak with the same impassive attitude
as before.

“With that said, for the sake of the future evaluation and to make sure
that you are aware of your current level, I will be measuring the amount
of everybody’s mana from this point forward.”

“Our mana?”

Oh, right. The amount of everybody’s mana gets measured during the first
orientation class. It’s a minor part of the story, so I always skimmed
through the event whenever I played through the whole episode later on,
which caused me to forget about it entirely.

Either way, the results of the mana evaluation will end up being useful
for my future tests.

When the story begins, the main character, Ian Fairytale, is rated in
the test as an ‘E’ rank, the absolute lowest level when it comes to
mana, so he ended up becoming an outcast among the students.

But later on, as Ian grows rapidly over the course of the story, the
students increasingly start to reevaluate him.

“Alright, come out one at a time when your name is called.”

Following the guidance of Professor Fernando, the students of the
provisional 3rd class were able to safely arrive at the training ground
along with everybody else.

It was a spacious training ground lined with seats for spectators and
fine sand making up the floor.

In addition to the provisional 3rd class I belong to, several
provisional classes all came out to the field as well. Ian and the
heroines had caught my eye in particular.

“Here, I will be measuring the mana of each and every freshman belonging
to the Magic Department.”

Professor Fernando used a small stick with a loudspeaker enchantment
cast on it to explain the rules to the crowd of freshmen enrolled in the
Magic Department, all of whom were standing together in an orderly
manner. Simply put, he was basically using a microphone, although it was
called a ‘loudspeaker’ spell here.

Meanwhile, the other professors of the provisional classes were sitting
in the stands in order to observe their potential students.

“First of all, take this.”

At his words, the assistants began handing out objects to the students
that had an appearance similar to hand grippers.

Of course, I accepted it as well. The translucent grip felt firm when I
held it.

“This particular magic instrument is a tool that measures the maximum
amount of mana of the user by looking at the concentration of their
mana. All you have to do is hold it with a firm grip while allowing the
mana within you to flow, and then your grade will automatically be
displayed before you. That grade is what your current position will be
within the academy, so this will be an important reference for any
future evaluations.”

As usual, Professor Fernando gave his speech in a perfect deadpan.

“Whenever you let your mana flow while trying to measure the amount of
your mana, magic commonly tends to come out as a result. With that said,
for the sake of the student’s safety, I will be doing the measurements
in an open space where there are no people for this evaluation. In each
class, five people should come out, one group at a time in order from
the lowest number.”

Thus began our first mana evaluation.

**NOTE**: More chapters will come soon, hope you enjoy these two for
now.

Chapter 3: - Mana Evaluation (2)
================================

༺ **Mana Evaluation (2)** ༻

Students began emerging from each provisional class and formed a line
for each group. After getting into their proper positions, they gripped
their mana meter and let their mana flow in an empty direction.

All of them emitted an elemental aura with respect to their individual
elements. After being used, that aura would end up leaving something
known as a ‘Mana Trail’. It was evidence that proved whether or not
magic of a specific element had been used.

In addition to elemental types and mana capacity, this mana evaluation
also contained an additional hidden evaluation factor that tested
students for their ability in something known as ‘Mana Control’. When
mana is channeled, traces of magic could end up remaining as well. Even
more so with powerful individuals that possessed greater mana.

In other words, what if, after having finished the evaluation of one’s
total mana capacity, that person obtained a high grade for their result,
but there was a lack of a magic aura?

It meant that the person in question would end up receiving a very good
score for their mana control, which would be added onto their class
placement evaluation score.

After each person belonging to the first group of students finally
finished their mana evaluation, Professor Fernando lifted the mana
meters into the air using telekinesis magic, lined them up, and began to
read each grade aloud.

“…Provisional 3rd Class. 1st, Grade C-. 2nd, Grade C+. 3rd, Grade C-.
4th, Grade C+. 5th, Grade C.”

Of course, there wouldn’t be any extra points for these guys. Even with
that amount of mana, aura still ended up being released.

“Next!”

With that said and done, the mana evaluation continued on.

Meanwhile.

*Haaaaaah-!*

“Oh my, I couldn’t control my dense, thick, limitless mana…”

The conceited noble, Tristan Humphrey, shook his head in an exaggerated
motion as he cast his overwhelming wind magic. When said with such a
confident face, it sounded more like a theatrical line than a serious
statement.

In the aftermath of his wind magic, both the hair and uniforms of the
professors and students alike had been violently shaken. Some of the
girls let out a grunt as they patted their hair neatly. Professor
Fernando, on the other hand, remained as expressionless as ever.

Tristan Humphrey’s mana ended up being a Grade B-. At that level, he was
already at the top level of the students belonging to the Magic
Department. His cocky demeanor wasn’t an empty bluff after all.

Of course, his mana control in particular was a negative score.

Mateo Jordana, who was an early villain in the game, also came out with
a Grade B-. Only a bit of his rock elemental aura was released, which
was worth a couple of extra points.

Next up was this year’s first seat, Luce Eltania, along with the second
seat, Kaya Astrean.

The noisy audience suddenly became quiet as the two girls overflowing
with elegance made their entrance. It was to the point where even the
air started to feel heavy from their aura. The students’ attention were
focused entirely on them.

“Woah.”

I unconsciously exclaimed. It was because Luce was much more beautiful
in person than in the game.

Wide strings could be seen flowing down each side of her silky rose-gold
hair. She was wearing a unique headband that had been designed with a
morpho butterfly in mind, with a deep blue color reflected within its
intense black border.

Her deep blue eyes, which seemed to contain the sea itself, were both
clear and pure, and put together with her fair skin and graceful face
simply radiated youth to anyone who watched.

As I admired Luce along with everybody else, I willed her level to be
shown, causing a system window to appear in front of me.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 110

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

Level 110. It was a number that was completely overwhelming among
freshmen.

When it came to the characters of Magic Knight of Märchen, Luce was my
second favourite. She was one of the game’s official heroines, and she
also ended up being paired with the main character, Ian, for the
upcoming class placement evaluation in a few days.

***That’s not to say that Kaya Astrean, the second seat, isn’t beautiful
as well, but… Sorry, I’m just more of a Luce person than a Kaya
person…***

***Of course, if my favourite character was here, Dorothy Heartnova, it
would be a different story entirely!***

***…Let’s just stop this nonsense and watch.***

Luce and Kaya, like the other students, clenched the mana meter in their
hands and stretched their arm forward.

In comparison to the other students who were releasing an elemental
aura.

The two girls seemed completely calm.

“…?”

Then, after a few moments of standing still in silence, Luce and Kaya
simply lowered their arms as if nothing had even happened in the first
place.

The students who were unaware of the existence of any kind of hidden
grading factor were perplexed, because they thought the visible release
of an aura was a given when using magic.

At that level of control, their mana control grade would have definitely
received a perfect score.

Just as he had done the previous times, Professor Fernando lifted the
mana meters the students had been holding with his telekinetic magic.

“The amount of mana this time will not be announced separately because
they are the first seat and the second seat respectively.”

After a quick explanation, Professor Fernando looked over the grades
displayed on Luce and Kaya’s mana meters and read them aloud.

“Luce Eltania, Grade A+. Kaya Astrean, Grade B+.”

The students watching from the audience were unable to keep their mouths
shut in awe. The A+ grade, which not a single person expected to show up
in this examination, had come out of the professor’s mouth.

Kaya, having become the second seat of the freshman class as well as
having Grade B+ mana, was already at the level of active wizards. It was
a ridiculous feat for a freshman at the academy, but Luce’s Grade A+ had
left such an overwhelming impression that it was left buried.

The Grade A+ score was widely considered to be the ceiling level for
most wizards. With that much talent, becoming a Grade S was a step that
could easily be accepted as a realistic story.

For example, the highest grade that an ordinary person born without any
talent could achieve with an immense amount of effort is Grade A- at
best.

Grade S was a realm that couldn’t be reached without talent.

This was all part of the setting that I had read countless times while
playing &lt;Magic Knight of Märchen&gt;.

As Luce was both talented and a hard worker, she had already planned to
become a Grade S before her second year.

“Grade A+? Wow.”

“Is she really a freshman like us?”

“Are we really the same age?”

However, as of now, Luce Eltania was unable to deliver the full extent
of her supposed Grade A+ power. This was a result of the mana evaluation
only measuring the maximum capacity, not the amount that could actually
be used.

She was constantly consuming a considerable portion of mana in order to
suppress her familiar, ‘Thunderbird – Galia’. Only after the conclusion
of her struggle to subjugate the Thunderbird during her final exams
would Luce be able to unleash her true power.

So then, what was she supposed to do before the battle of the
Thunderbird? Well, at that time, she should be helped by the main
character who would be considerably active by then, but unfortunately,
it was starting to look like he would be a dumbass.

Anyway, amidst the ongoing gossip coming from the crowd of students,
Luce and Kaya finally exited the stage. Kaya clenched her fist in
frustration while shaking her head.

‘It looks like she’s angry.’

Over the course of the game, Kaya would continue to feel inferior when
faced with the solid wall known as Luce.

But later on, Kaya would grow strong enough to cast the 8-star ultimate
spell \[Yggdrasil\].

In this world, the absolute highest rank of magic was 9-star, capable of
world destruction. Even then, the lower 8-star magic was still powerful
enough for large-scale battles. Despite that, Luce’s defeat seemed
unlikely.

However, Kaya was not the kind of character who lived her life while
harboring an inferiority complex after seeing someone better than her.
In fact, she had a tendency to admire and blindly follow those who were
vastly different and overwhelmingly strong, regardless of their status.

As I mentioned before, if she were to ever be deceived into joining a
cult, she was the type of person who would definitely get in trouble.

“Next.”

Hearing the Professor call for the next group, I readied myself. Now, it
was my turn.

I stepped forward, mingled among the other students, and stood alongside
them.

Once I had one in my hand, I proceeded to stretch the mana meter
forward.

‘Currently, my maximum mana is 320–’

Now that I was thinking about it, I didn’t know much about this world’s
mana grading standards. It was just a minor detail briefly mentioned
when passing through the game’s story.

***I wonder how my 320 mana will compare to the average?***

“Start!”

At the professor’s command, I began squeezing the mana meter and poured
out all my mana.

‘Controlling this… is a little difficult, isn’t it?’

As a result of my poor control, cold air flowed out from where I stood,
forming small pieces of ice in the process.

Soon, just as I heard a buzzing sound from the mana meter, I immediately
cut off the flow of mana.

***Just what will my grade be?***

Ignoring my heart fluttering in my chest, I checked the grade displayed
on the mana meter.

…It was Grade ‘E’.

“…”

The worst possible grade. You would have gotten a better outcome if you
had simply grabbed a random bystander on the streets who lacked any
prior experience or knowledge in magic and measured their mana.

***It’s a little… serious…?***

***…Ah, I just remembered.***

‘Wasn’t there another Grade E other than Ian this year? Was that
actually me–?’

After Ian’s turn in the game, I remembered hearing a student commenting
something along the lines of, ‘There are two Grade E students this
year.’

Now that I’ve figured that out, I finally remembered just what kind of
character Isaac was. This guy was an extra among extras that ended up
with a sense of inferiority towards Ian, despite having a weightless
existence.

At least Kaya, who felt inferior to Luce, had the tenacity of a second
seat.

On the other hand, Isaac, who felt inferior to Ian, was pathetic.

With that said, at the beginning of the game’s story, he became one of
Mateo’s lackeys and makes several attempts to harass Ian, who was a
Grade E just like him, but ended up easily getting robbed of that
position soon enough.

Besides his failed attempts at petty revenge, simply watching Ian’s
rapid growth made him frustrated to the point where he could only grind
his teeth, and in the end, his weight turned to dust– forever being
nothing more than a third-rate extra.

His purpose was to be a small darkness that would add a halo to Ian’s
growth, and was commonly considered to be the weakest point in &lt;Magic
Knight of Märchen&gt;.

“Provisional 3rd Class. 21st Grade C-. 22nd Grade C. 23rd Grade C. 24th
Grade C. 25th Grade E—?”

All the students whose names were announced, including me, headed back
to our seats.

When Professor Fernando came across my grade while checking the mana
meter labelled No. 25, his expression appeared to have become perplexed.

“Grade E—?”

***What?***

***So what?***

“Grade E?”

“Wait, did he actually get Grade E? Really?”

“How in the world did a Grade E manage to get accepted into *the*
Märchen Academy?”

“That’s ridiculous, isn’t it— that’s certainly one hell of a guy in a
different sense, huh?”

Once my meager result was announced, the students’ attention was
inevitably drawn to me, student number 25. Some laughed at my
misfortune, while others were surprised. Rather than the surprise shown
at Luce’s result, this surprise was more along the lines of ‘How did you
even get into this academy?’ It basically meant the same thing as
mockery.

This was Märchen Academy, the single most prestigious academy on the
entire continent.

In other words, the fact that someone with a mana capacity equivalent to
Grade E had managed to make their way into the Magic Department of the
Märchen Academy was akin to some sort of doubtful miracle.

For reference, Ian Fairytale, who would also be graded at the same Grade
E as myself, was able to enroll thanks to his ‘rarity’. It was a result
of Ian’s unique ability to use ‘light’ magic.

On the other hand, all I had was low-level ice magic— not a rarity at
all.

Perhaps the original owner of this body, Isaac, got accepted with his
theoretical ability in the entrance exam.

In that case, it was a shame that I didn’t have any of his theoretical
knowledge left in my head right now.

‘…Uh?’

***…Wait a sec, the more that I think about it, the more I realize I
have nothing to offer, right?***

***Uh, wait, what about…***

While the students were indulging in their gossip, Professor Fernando
suddenly intervened.

“If you were able to get into our academy with this amount of mana— your
theoretical grades must be excellent. Your goal must be a ‘Scholar’,
then. Of course, the role of a magic scholar is significant for the
development of the magic system. You’ll have to pull yourself together,
but don’t be discouraged by the others.”

“…”

He said it as if he were sure that being a scholar was my desired career
path.

Of course, it wasn’t something to be angry about. This was Professor
Fernando’s own way of showing me consideration. At the very least, as
long as my goal was known to be a scholar, even with my actual mana
capacity being incredibly insufficient among the student body, I would
be ridiculed less by the other students.

As I recalled, Professor Fernando had said the same thing to Ian in the
game as well.

Ian, then, would become furious and exclaim, ‘My dream is not to be a
scholar! My dream is to become a magic knight!’

After making such an unrealistic claim, he would end up getting
countless laughs from the other students in response.

“Grade E? E, huh? How dare such an inferior being stand in the same line
as one as superior as myself?! It’s funny, it’s so funny!”

As expected, Tristan Humphrey, the conceited blonde aristocrat, made a
gruesome mockery of my terrible score.

The lines he said were funny, sure, but the one saying them was stupid.
You bastard.

“Excuse me!”

At that time, the second seat, Kaya Astrean, suddenly raised her hand
and shouted.

What was it this time? I don’t think I’ve ever seen an event like this
happening in the game.

“Have there ever been any cases where an error occurs in the process of
evaluating the amount of mana? For example, a case where the grade is
measured incorrectly…”

“What?”

Both Professor Fernando and the students responded to her question as if
they couldn’t understand.

I was the same.

Perhaps this was a question stemming from pointless doubts such as,
‘Even though somebody as strong as myself is a student at the Märchen
Academy, does it make sense for a Grade E to be in the same year’?

***—I have no clue.***

“Hmm… I see. First of all, there is nothing wrong with the mana
evaluation method.”

Professor Fernando quietly answered her question in a calm fashion as he
picked up my mana meter, which was supposedly the root of the issue at
hand.

The professor then began to pour his mana into the mana meter,
undisturbed by the stares directed at him.

Just as one would expect from a professor, no elemental aura was
released in the process, and with a ping, the magic power was quickly
evaluated on the device.

‘Grade A’. Professor Fernando confirmed the result and showed it to
Kaya.

“As you can see, the mana meter is working just fine. According to the
results of the inspection this morning, there were no abnormalities in
the device. At the very least, there has never been a case of an
incorrect measurement. If an error occurs, the operation itself won’t
work because of the device’s structure.

“…Is that so.”

Kaya now had an expression of disappointment on her face, as if
Professor Fernando’s answer wasn’t the one she wanted to hear.

Seeing the reaction he was given, Professor Fernando then proceeded to
explain the second possible explanation.

“…Of course, there are some cases where the evaluation ends up being
wrong even without an error. Rare, but possible.”

Professor Fernando suddenly made an unfamiliar argument, confusing the
students listening.

Regardless of their confusion, the students soon understood after his
next words.

“It is said that an Archwizard has a level of control over mana beyond
the realm of possibility, allowing them to deconstruct and reconstruct
the flow of mana within their body. If that’s possible, then they could
control their mana output during the evaluation to achieve their desired
grade. However, this is only possible for Archwizards who have been
blessed by the heavens and honed themselves through countless hours of
meditation, training, and solitude.”

“Without exceptions? Like a method where, even without being an
Archwizard, you could adjust your magic level—”

“I assure you. There are no exceptions other than this. If there was,
they would probably be a superhuman who has already mastered all forms
of magic. It would never happen at the student level, even if you were
born with a level of genius talent that would be regarded as irrational
by global standards.”

Regardless of any further objections, Professor Fernando continued to
assert his point.

That was the official setting, after all.

An Archwizard was perceived in this world as a transcendental being that
lived outside the jurisdiction of natural law, and even the Emperor
would have to be wary of one.

“Is that so…?”

For some reason, Kaya looked shocked by this well-known fact.

Could she be flustered while thinking, ‘Really, a Grade E that actually
exists at the same Märchen Academy as myself?’

She certainly prided herself on being admitted to the prestigious
Märchen Academy. In other words, the Grade E that lowered the overall
level of the academy must have been a thorn in her eye.

Oh, of course, this was just an exaggeration on my part. She was a
good-natured person, so it was probably just at the level of a minor
discomfort.

It was definitely a shame, though. Even if you ignored me, Ian was still
there as well. The fact that there was not just one, but two students
with only Grade E level mana must have scratched her pride quite a bit.

After 40 more minutes of testing, the mana evaluation was finally over.

Just as I thought, the story progressed as normal.

Ian was graded as a Grade E level mana, and after being mistaken for a
scholar, ended up revealing his dream of becoming a magic knight to the
entire student body, certainly showing off his presence as the main
character as he made the students laugh.

Facing the students of the Department of Magic, who had finally settled
down and began standing in an orderly manner, Professor Fernando began
to speak.

“The mana evaluation has concluded. Each of you should be aware of your
own position, keep it in mind every moment, and use it as a stimulus for
your devotion to magic. You may be aware of this already, but I will
emphasize it here once more. The tradition of our Märchen Academy is
survival of the fittest. The strong consume the weak, and the weak are
consumed. So be strong to the core if you want to avoid being consumed.
Try as hard as you can in order to survive. That is all.”

I had experienced the harsh educational climate of the Märchen Academy
several times already while playing the game.

***Ha, the weakest, the Grade E. Isn’t that the perfect prey to be
bullied in this environment?***

With that in mind, I thought that I would have to try to keep myself
from standing out for a while.

“…”

For some reason, I could still feel Kaya glaring daggers at me.

I had been pretending not to notice her stare for a while now, but I was
sure the reason for it was because of my Grade E.

It seemed like it would be a rough start from the very beginning.

<span id="0003_4_-_Goal.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 4: - Goal
=================

༺ **Goal** ༻

Märchen Academy.

The entirety of a vast, remote island located in the eastern part of the
continent was the Märchen Academy itself.

They had established their own independent economic system.

First and foremost, the currency used was not the prevalent currency
that was commonly used elsewhere. The only currency that could be used
here was referred to as ‘Gel’.

The most common method for a student to earn gel was undergoing either a
performance evaluation or another form of testing. It would then be
distributed in varying amounts depending on one’s grades or some other
specific criteria. It was also possible to earn gel by working
part-time, but it wasn’t very efficient. It would be best to think of it
as a supplementary measure when running low.

Other than that, converting local money into gel was another valid
method used by students. However, it was only possible before the start
of each semester, at least until the first semester’s tuition was paid
for. If you had a lot of gel, you could even pay the tuition with it as
well.

What if I were to run out of gel? In that case, I would have no choice
but to borrow some from somebody else, go to the academy bank for a
loan, or try and work part-time. I would end up starving otherwise. This
was a harsh place, after all.

At the beginning of the year, all of the freshmen who came to the
academy were given 5000 gel.

With the textbooks and school uniforms already being fully provided by
the academy, unless you overspent on anything unnecessary, you would
definitely have enough to last until the next performance evaluation at
the very least.

Knowing that, I decided to use my gel in moderation at the student
cafeteria for my lunch and dinner. Despite that, everything still ended
up tasting delicious and I felt fully satisfied.

What a strange feeling this was.

Anyways, after defeating Trevion earlier in the day and personally
experiencing the entire entrance ceremony and orientation, I was now
fully convinced that I had been transmigrated into the world of
&lt;Magic Knight of Märchen&gt;.

I also made a trip over to the library to read an \[Introduction to
Basic Magic\] textbook that I believed to be appropriate for my current
level.

Fortunately enough, understanding the contents of the textbook was not
too difficult, possibly due to my prior knowledge of the game.

After confirming that fact, I also went ahead and took out an
\[Introduction to Advanced Magic\] textbook and began reading.

‘Oh, it’s more difficult than I thought.’

Physics? Chemistry? I’m not quite sure which it was, being a liberal
arts major myself, but it felt like I was seeing something similar.

Just looking at the complicated formulas and equations made me start
feeling dizzy, so I quickly closed the book and headed back to the
dormitory.

At Märchen Academy, there were a total of four dormitories. The
dormitory you’re assigned to is determined by grades each semester.

As for myself, I resided in the ‘Doris Hall’, the lowest ranking
dormitory with relatively poor facilities as a result. The dormitories
were assigned to each student based on their entrance exam scores.

Just as you would expect, Doris Hall was a dormitory for the inferior
students. A gathering place for those with the lowest grades in the
academy. Ian Fairytail, the protagonist, also resided here for the time
being.

I entered my room.

All of my belongings had already been transferred into my room: clothes,
toiletries, disposables, writing utensils, and everything else I needed.

In any case, it was quite a small room. Of course, by that, I meant that
it was just small in comparison to the other dorms.

As an experienced civil service exam taker who had been previously
living in a 3-pyeong studio in Sillim-dong, I was able to wholeheartedly
attest to the fact that it was spacious, clean, and luxurious.

For reference, the academy had purposefully made the facilities in here
more narrow than the other dormitories for the purpose of motivating
students to try and get out of here. Elitism, indeed.

Even despite that, however, the showers were still extremely
well-equipped.

“I’m stuck in a place like this!?!”

“Huh! What?”

***That startled me…***

It sounded like somebody was shouting in the room next door – a cry
filled with the strong will to escape.

It seemed that a room like this must have been a sizeable blow for the
spoiled aristocrats, who had always lived their entire lives in an
extremely nice place.

I shut the door behind me and sat myself down on the bed. The single bed
felt incredibly soft as it gently enveloped my buttocks.

“…”

It had already been 3 full days since I transmigrated into this game.

If I were to fall asleep tonight and still not end up back in my own
reality, then just as I’ve thought to myself many times ever since I
came here, my goal was clear.

I needed to clear this game.

The main problem currently was that Ian, the main character whose death
would serve as the condition for a bad ending, was no better than a
shitty newbie.

Hell-Difficulty was obviously an extremely challenging experience,
starting with the enemy’s specs. As a result, the player was required to
have excellent control abilities from the very start.

On the other hand, Ian, this bastard, had already almost gotten a bad
ending right at the beginning of the first day, and there was no
guarantee that this would not continue to happen in the future.

‘If that’s the case, I just have to get stronger.’

***If the protagonist is useless, then there is only me. An
unpredictable variable with the ability to prevent the numerous bad
endings of this world.***

According to the scenario, this was because Ian, despite being a human,
was born with the light element, which was a demon’s only weakness. As
such, Ian would be able to defeat demons even with significant level
differences between them.

Normally, light elemental abilities and divine powers were only usable
by the noble saintesses blessed by God. Simply put, it should have been
impossible for Ian, an ordinary human, to have the light element from
birth.

However, it eventually came to light that within Ian flowed the mixed
blood of a human and a heavenly being, who naturally wielded divine
power. This is the full explanation of how he was born with the ability
to wield divine power without a blessing. It was a backstory supposed to
come out as a twist later on.

Of course, both Ian and I must gradually improve our strengths together.
The light element had many uses besides direct combat, and if he still
couldn’t use his divine power later on, demons with an invincible status
would begin appearing regardless.

When that time comes, Ian will have to dispel their invincible status by
using the 8-star light element ultimate spell \[Expelled from Paradise\]
along with his final weapon ‘Luminous Sword.’ In other words, it was
necessary to at least be strong enough to properly progress the story.

‘In the end, though, the biggest issue is still going to be the final
boss.’

The game’s final boss,

***‘Nephid, Evil God of Destruction.’***

It was a damn tough boss. In Hell-Difficulty, even if the player maxed
out their specs, if they were hit even once, it would be game over. This
was because Nephid could cast 9-star magic, a level of power capable of
destroying the world.

The magic circle for resurrecting the sealed Evil God Nephid was
engraved on the roof of ‘Bartos Hall’ in Märchen Academy.

However, it would be impossible to even see or touch the engraving
because of a 9-star spell blocking absolute perception. What if you
destroy the building? During a Q&A event for the game, a user had asked
that exact question to the developers, and I certainly still remembered
the answer to that question even now. The developers had responded by
saying, ‘It would be meaningless to destroy the building because the
magic circle itself is actually engraved beyond time and space.’

In the end, the Evil God Nephid was bound to be resurrected when the
time came.

‘Still, if I could just catch Nephid, that would end everything.’

The demons would no longer be a threat because Nephid was the one who
had sent them to Ian in the first place.

Nephid was still sealed away in the Abyss, and could only release a
little bit of mana to the outside world at a time.

The mana Nephid sent outside would be used to wake up the demons that
laid dormant beneath the surface. It was this restriction that made him
only able to send a few demons to kill Ian every once in a while.

All this meant was that I needed to prevent the bad ending by defeating
all the demons myself.

‘In order to clear this game, I need to become strong enough to beat the
final boss as well…’

As long as I was Isaac, the goal was clear.

‘Let’s check my current potential.’

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 25 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (D+): 16/100 \[UP\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (D-): 10/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Other Races Combat Power (E): 1/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Demon Combat Power (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

***Where should I invest my stat points first?***

***It’s finally time to start thinking about the future.***

There will be a class placement evaluation soon, and around that time,
another demon would appear.

The problem was that, in order to catch that demon, there was a harsh
condition attached where I would be forced to avoid elimination for
about 5 hours in a battle royale against only those stronger than me.

However, if I were to try and increase my immediate chances of survival
by increasing my \[vs. Human Combat Power\] potential, I would end up
being much further away from defeating the Evil God Nephid in the long
run.

I definitely needed to level up even just a little bit faster.

‘Then, I should give top priority to the \[Physical Training
Efficiency\] and \[Magical Training Efficiency\] potentials.’

After making my decision, I proceeded to distribute 10 stat points to
\[Physical Training Efficiency\] and 15 to \[Magic Training
Efficiency\].

*Ding ♪*

\[Potential \[Physical Training Efficiency\] has increased from D+ to
C!\] \[Potential \[Magical Training Efficiency\] has increased from D-
to C-!\]

***Even with this, I don’t expect any dramatic effect until the upcoming
class placement evaluation, but I hope it’s at least as good as the
figures show.***

‘Now that I’ve finished that, the next thing I need to do is make myself
a training plan.’

…With that said, I was starting to feel exhausted already.

As I sat at my desk, unfolded the parchment, and began writing down my
future plans.

In the middle of that, I somehow fell asleep.

\* \* \*

Each and every room of the top-ranked dormitory of Märchen Academy,
‘Charles Hall’ was luxurious, truly befitting its splendid exterior.

After all, this was a super-luxurious facility where only the top 10
students from each department and year could stay.

There were also facilities that could be used by employees.

The academy itself had prepared high-quality human resources for
students living at Charles Hall.

It was there that Kaya Astrean, the prodigious second seat of the
freshman class at the Department of Magic, was seated at her desk while
resting her chin on her palms, deeply lost in her own thoughts.

Inside a dark room, the soft light of an enchanted lamp quietly
illuminated the figure of her in a luxurious nightgown.

“It really just doesn’t make any sense at all…”

Kaya was reflecting on what she had witnessed earlier today.

This morning, when that man with silver-blue colored hair defeated the
demon.

Kaya clearly felt an overwhelming amount of mana overflowing from within
him.

Yet, at the time of the mana evaluation, the same man achieved Grade E,
the worst grade.

It was an obvious contradiction. It could only mean that the mana meter
he used was broken.

Was it possible that the silver-blue haired man just didn’t let any of
his mana leak out? Impossible. She already confirmed that there was
elemental aura flowing out.

Besides, even at that time, Kaya herself had even felt his feeble mana
personally.

‘There’s no way that’s true.’

After all, the ability that the silver-blue haired man had showcased
when he obliterated the demon was already at a level far superior to her
own.

It wasn’t that she mistook his ability either, since Kaya knew how to
manipulate wind and ice elements herself. Therefore, she had an eye for
ice magic.

The moment she saw his 5-star spell, \[Frost Explosion\], she felt like
she was watching a masterpiece that had been created by a master
craftsman with great care for decades.

How in the world could such an expert be classified as a mere Grade E?
She was about to burst into laughter when the topic first came up.

Contrary to her expectation, Professor Fernando had insisted that the
mana meter’s results were impossible to get wrong.

The silver blue haired young man, number 25, did not raise any
objections to such a claim and just continued to stay silent.

In spite of all the ongoing giggles and mockery of the surrounding
students.

***It was almost as if he had known this would happen from the very
start…***

‘An Archwizard is an existence able to easily change their maximum mana
at will…’

She couldn’t help but think back to the words she heard before. To be
able to fake their amount of mana, by changing mana itself? How would
that be any different from the absurd claim that each and every cell in
your body could also be changed at will?

No, in the first place, an Archwizard was a being that would transcend
common sense just by existing, so even if that’s possible…

It still didn’t make any sense that a student the same age as her was
successfully able to reach the level of an Archwizard.

An ‘Archwizard’ was an honorable title that was given only to those who
have been recognized as the absolute best wizards across the entire
continent.

Even the most successful first-class wizards, such as the Tower Masters,
the Leaders of well-renowned and high-ranking Guilds, or Court Wizards,
were not even comparable to the size of a fingernail in front of an
Archwizard…

Even Kaya’s family, the Ducal house of Astrean, with their high social
status, would be forced to bow their heads in front of an Archwizard.

The level of an Archwizard was at the point where – whether it was
heaven’s blessings, an unparalleled talent, or bone-breaking efforts –
all of it was required.

In the first place, although the man who was number 25 had powerful mana
when facing the demon, it was still a bit weaker than the first-class
wizards Kaya had seen thus far. It was not enough power to confidently
state that he had already reached the level of an Archwizard.

However, even thinking about it that way couldn’t explain the
inconsistency of his mana being Grade E.

‘I noticed that the black-haired man earlier didn’t know about him
either.’

After the silver-blue haired man left, Kaya went and woke up the person
named Ian Fairytail who was passed out in the clearing, and used healing
magic to treat his wounds.

His wounds actually recovered themselves surprisingly quickly, as if
Kaya’s healing magic only served as an accelerator.

During the healing process, she asked Ian if he knew the man who
defeated the demon.

To her disappointment, he seemed to be completely unaware. In the first
place, his attention at the time was focused entirely on the demon that
had already turned to ashes and vanished by that point.

She decided it would just end up being a waste of time to keep asking
him, so Kaya stopped talking.

‘Could it be a secret where I’m the only one who knows student number 25
is actually strong?’

She had already told Ian that she would report the issue of the
appearance of a demon to the academy. After the mana evaluation was
finally over, she decided to report it to Professor Fernando.

She couldn’t bear to see it be reported any later.

Demons weren’t known for their collective behavior, and typically
appeared as natural disasters. In other words, there was never any kind
of rush to report it when the aforementioned demon had already been
slain.

However, after hearing the result of the mana evaluation of the person
who defeated the demon, with Fernando’s explanation added on top of
that.

Kaya reported the incident a little differently from the truth.

She reported that the demon was already dying, and disappeared soon
after. That was why she didn’t know the identity of the demon slayer.

All because she had suddenly thought of an unbelievable possibility.

“Really, no, really, that’s got to be nonsense…”

After the perception of the impossibility and possibility that had been
layered on top of each other, slowly peeled away… the truth hidden
underneath was finally revealed.

Finally, Kaya voiced the possibility.

“If it’s true that number 25 has reached the level of an Archwizard,
then…? What if he arbitrarily adjusted his mana when he defeated the
demon earlier today…? If that’s the case, then, is that person a
so-called genius among geniuses, surpassing all of the Archwizards that
have ever been recorded in history…?”

What had long been considered an absolute, immutable truth could easily
be overturned at any time, whenever an exception were to appear.

This was something that humanity had only been able to deduce with
inductive reasoning thus far.

However, what if today, the very ‘exception’ that had only been spoken
of in theory had suddenly appeared?

What if that ‘exception’ was number 25, the man with silver-blue hair?

“That’s amazing!”

Thrill. Excitement. These were the emotions she felt when arriving at
this conclusion.

It meant that he was a being who would become a legend.

And she was the first person to know his identity!

It felt surreal. She felt as if she was facing a monumental truth that
she shouldn’t have known.

Kaya began to tremble and the corners of her mouth twitched upward.

“No, no. Don’t get ahead of yourself just yet.”

***The professor already said it himself that it was impossible. Let’s
think carefully.***

When she calmed down and went over the details once again, it was clear
that this was impossible. In fact, it was something no different from
something in the realm of fantasy.

***But, what if it’s real? Really, what if it’s really real?***

What if he went and entered the academy while hiding his true power for
some unknown reason?

Without realizing it, Kaya’s thoughts had already reached this point. So
then, under the assumption that this person was an important figure
hiding their identity, her mind became focused on keeping quiet about
his contribution to defeating the demon, seeing as he was pretending to
be a weakling.

‘I need to find out.’

In the end, Kaya resolved herself to speak to number 25 tomorrow.

Chapter 5: - Realm of an Archwizard
===================================

༺ **Realm of an Archwizard** ༻

In the morning, I finished the orientation for \[Introduction to Basic
Magic\]. The content itself was easy to understand, thanks to having
played &lt;Magic Knight of Märchen&gt;. It didn’t tell me much, though.

After class, I headed to the student cafeteria for lunch.

“Hey, that person…”

“Is he that Grade E guy from yesterday? Really, how did he get in here?”

“He’s not good enough…”

While sitting alone and eating my 50 gel lunch, I could hear the mocking
remarks directed at me from another table.

Considering their lack of subtlety, they clearly meant for me to hear
everything they were saying.

I felt it before, but it seems the fact that I was a Grade E in mana was
spreading among the students.

The academy advocated for a system where the weak were oppressed by the
strong, so naturally, students openly looked down on those ranked lower
than them.

As a Grade E who scored even lower than Ian Fairytale, who also had the
same Grade E mana, this fate was inevitable, since I was the weakest
student.

***In other words, I can’t beat anyone here.***

‘Let’s just ignore it for now.’

Today was the fourth day since I came to this game world and as
expected, I couldn’t go back to reality even if I fell asleep regularly.

Seeing as I have to stay here, I shouldn’t go and antagonize other
students since it would make my academic life difficult. It was best to
just ignore them.

I didn’t have time to worry about such trivial stuff anyway, I instead
had to devote all of my time to training from now on, meaning I had no
time to worry about anything else.

This morning, I had some time before my classes for the day started, so
I decided to jot down my plans for the future on a piece of parchment
paper, recalling my previous memories of playing the game while doing
so.

As for my first priority, I was thinking of aiming for the top of this
department.

Grades were not only the easiest, but also the most indicative way to
measure how strong an individual is, and since I needed to be the
strongest to survive, it was imperative that I increased my grades. My
ultimate goal was to eventually surpass the top seat, Luce, and I would
do what needed to be done in order to achieve that goal.

As a side note, getting low grades wasn’t an option. If I failed
repeatedly, I would be expelled, kicked out of the academy, and then
this world would receive a bad ending.

With that in mind, I planned to go and find the legendary weapon,
‘Hilde’s Frostscythe.’

Hilde’s Frostscythe is the final ice element weapon, and in the original
game, it could be obtained after the second year’s second semester. But,
because I wasn’t bound by the story of the game like Ian Fairytale, it
didn’t matter.

‘I want to get it before the end of the first year if possible…’

To obtain Hilde’s Frostscythe, I needed to complete the trial given by
‘Ice Dragon Hilde’, but in order to even think of receiving said trial,
I had to first raise my \[Ice Element Resistance} to 60 at the very
least.

I needed to become strong enough to get Hilde’s Frostscythe as soon as
possible.

According to the setting in the original game, one person could only use
up to two kinds of elemental magic, depending on whether or not they
were compatible with it. The only exception to this was the power of
fairies.

I didn’t know what element that Ian, who currently only used light
magic, would choose from among fire, water, ice, lightning, rock, and
wind in the future. That was because, in the game, the second element of
Ian was decided by the player, but now that wasn’t the case.

***If he chooses the ice element, Hilde’s Frostscythe will be his final
target… Sorry, that’s mine now, I have nothing to give to a fucking
newbie.***

So I could only hope that he wouldn’t choose the ice element.

‘I have to clear the game no matter what.’

I’m going to get as strong as I can in order to win this game.

It was my specialty to achieve my goals through grit and hard work. It
was an asset that I had acquired throughout my life studying for exams.

I played &lt;Magic Knight of Märchen&gt; as both a break and a reward
after a long day of studying.

Although, on my day off I would play it all day long, and this only
continued after I passed the exam.

I could’ve never imagined that I would be transported into &lt;Magic
Knight of Märchen&gt; as an extra, and I could tell it would be a long
and arduous battle before my final goal was achieved.

***I’ll commit evil deeds without hesitation.***

“Fufufufu, fufufu…”

“Hey, is that kid laughing?”

Oh, I burst out laughing without realizing it. I seem to have been too
engrossed in myself.

I could hear someone comment when I laughed, but I didn’t care.

After the meal, I was walking toward the classroom…

“How are you?”

“…?”

…When suddenly, someone greeted me from behind.

I came to a halt and looked back. I saw a familiar female student with
light green pigtails tied with black hairbands and two eyes that were a
beautiful jade color, shining like emeralds.

Kaya Astrean, the second seat freshman in the Department of Magic, was
dressed in her school uniform.

\[Kaya Astreane\] **Lv:** 90

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

***But… Why is Kaya talking to me?***

***Is it to give advice like an old man, to work hard because I’m an
unimportant Grade E?***

***If it’s Kaya, that could be the case since she’s nosy.***

“No. 25 of Provisional 3rd Class, right?”

Was it because of the impression that a Grade E gave? She managed to
remember my number.

“Ah yes, you remember my number?”

I just answered out of curiosity, but suddenly Kaya’s shoulders
trembled.

“Uhh, I didn’t remember it because I was interested in you…!”

She turned her head sideways and answered in a timid tone.

Her face grew red with embarrassment. Kaya had a shy personality, so she
reacted to even a hint of embarrassment like this, one could even call
it a defense mechanism.

Wow, she’s really familiar. Is it because I saw her in the game?

I almost flashed her a smile that could only be described as fatherly. I
had no reason to show such a smile, so I kept my mouth shut and looked
at Kaya, waiting for her to speak.

“Hmmm.”

Kaya cleared her throat and looked back at me.

“Do you remember me? From the same Provisional 3rd Class… Kaya Astrean.”

“Yes, because you’re the second seat.”

“…”

Suddenly, there was an awkward air.

***What is this feeling? Was there anything strange about what I just
said?***

‘Ah.’

***Oh, right.***

Kaya Astrean was the second daughter of the Duke of Astrean, who was
responsible for managing the western part of this country, Zelvere.

She was, in other words, a high-ranking aristocrat, whose name was known
by all.

On the other hand, I was a commoner without a surname.

Her status was too high for me to just say, ‘I remember you because
you’re the second seat.’

It would have been natural if I had added something like ‘I remember you
because you are from the Astrean family’.

***Do I have to be polite now?***

‘It’s an honor to talk to you…?’ No, it’s a bit too much.

“What is your name, by any chance?”

***Thank God.***

Kaya immediately blew away my worries by asking a single question.

“It’s Isaac.”

“Isaac… Isaac…”

Kaya repeated my name twice as if to clearly engrave it into her mind.

I was both flattered and thankful for her reaction.

I felt like I had made a huge mistake by forgetting to add the ‘Daughter
of the Duke’s family’ part, but it seems like my worries were needless
since Kaya was too kind to bully me.

The real problem was the students who occasionally stole glances at me
and Kaya as they passed.

They tried to infer the contents of the conversation by reading our
lips.

‘Did Kaya just talk to a Grade E commoner…?’

‘Why?’

‘Is she here to call him pathetic because he’s Grade E?’

‘It’s Lady Kaya, she probably came to say something ‘because he was so
pitiful’.’

It seemed that their conversation was roughly going this way.

The situation where the second seat freshman of the Magic Department,
and the daughter of the Astrean family with Grade B+ mana spoke to the
weakest freshman with Grade E mana, and was a commoner, was simply
absurd.

***What should I do…?***

It was unnatural, but would it be better to bow down at a right angle
and say, ‘Nice to meet you, Lady of the dignified Duke Family!’

“Isaac, I’ll ask you straightforwardly… Why are you hiding your
identity?”

“…Huh?”

***…What does she mean by that?***

“What are you talking about?”

“You can’t hide it from me. You’re hiding your identity, aren’t you?”

Kaya looked nervous.

***What kind of bullshit is this.***

***…No way? Wait a minute.***

‘…I get it.’

Kaya must have witnessed me defeat ‘Trevion the Evil.’

‘Could it be that, then…?’

The next memory that came to my mind was yesterday’s mana evaluation.

When Professor Fernando said something about an ‘Archwizard’ being able
to deceive the maximum amount of mana, I remembered the look Kaya had on
her face.

If it was true that she witnessed the scene of me defeating Trevion,
then the expression on her face was quite convincing.

I showed overwhelming power in front of Kaya, yet according to the mana
meter, my mana was only Grade E… Anyone would look at the two events and
think it was ridiculous.

***…Wait, could it be that? Does she think I am a genius among geniuses
who has reached the level of an Archwizard?***

“The realm of an Archwizard… You can hide your own mana, right?”

Kaya ask quietly on purpose so that no one could hear.

My head was throbbing…

Kaya felt inferior to Luce, but she had a tendency to harbor admiration
for people whom she found out of her reach. Perhaps I was seen as the
latter.

She was someone who blindly followed such people.

Yes, this girl who appeared flawless, was in reality a fool among fools.

First of all, Kaya’s misunderstanding was troublesome for me since I
needed to be regarded as a ‘weak commoner’ by people unconditionally in
the beginning, but if she suddenly started saying things like ‘Isaac is
actually strong’ people’s perception of me might change.

As Isaac, I need a reason to be Mateo’s subordinate for a while.

First, however.

‘The most dangerous problem is…’

Whether or not the fact that ‘I’ defeated the demon was reported to the
school.

If reported, it would be a very serious issue.

‘…I guess not.’

But I concluded immediately that it wasn’t the case.

If my contribution in defeating the demon had been reported, the academy
would have made a big deal out of it and rewarded me.

In particular, ‘Alice’, one of the most powerful people in the academy
and the president of the student council, wouldn’t have stayed still. If
she had heard the news, she would have tried to approach me in any way
possible.

If you looked at the story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Alice couldn’t
touch Ian, the main character, rashly because he came from the Fairytale
Viscount family.

But, it wouldn’t matter even if she killed an insignificant commoner
like me at any time.

In other words, Alice was unaware of the fact that I had defeated the
demon.

‘You didn’t say anything?’

***Why is that?***

***Why, Kaya?***

…Even if it would cause me a headache later, it seems I needed to go
along with this fool’s misunderstanding.

A momentary silence descended upon us as I carefully thought of my next
words.

After closing my eyes and opening them, I sighed quietly and spoke with
a serious expression.

“Did you tell anyone about me?”

“…!”

An age-old cliché, a nerd that hides their power. In short, someone who
pretends to be powerless. I decided to imitate that role.

“I didn’t…”

“…”

“…”

“…”

“No, that… I reported it to the academy the same day the demon appeared
at the entrance ceremony, but I said I didn’t know who killed the demon,
on purpose.”

I tried to endure the tingling of my hands and limbs and looked at Kaya.

Perhaps understanding the flow of the atmosphere, Kaya was clearly
nervous. She seemed to think that her guess was correct.

“Why?”

“Because you seem to want to hide your power…”

‘Anyway, thank god she noticed.’

It was a relief that Kaya was very perceptive in matters like these.

She almost caused a game over without even knowing it.

I could roughly guess how the academy must have reacted to Kaya’s
report.

In the setting of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, demons were regarded as
natural disasters. If it had already been dealt with, there was nothing
more to look at.

The most important thing was ‘student safety’ and since everyone was
safe beside the sole victim Ian, the only thing they would do is mark
him for a few days and be done with it.

The academy’s staff members got in a lot of trouble because so many
demons appeared in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ thus holding the chairman
accountable for the potential dangers of the situation and the
inevitable commotion a demon brought.

Nevertheless, the academy’s staff members somehow manage to solve every
problem so that it doesn’t interfere with the academy’s curriculum. They
don’t get much attention despite the amount of important and troublesome
tasks they have to take care of.

Alice must have been looking for the person who defeated the demon by
now.

She was unaware of how demons were created, so she didn’t know when and
where a demon would appear, however, she knew to an extent, that it was
Nephid’s will that demons arose.

Nephid had a simple goal in mind when creating demons, and that was
eliminating any potential threats to them.

So, Alice had no choice but to look for the one who defeated the demon.

‘Let’s maintain this atmosphere for now.’

I closed my eyes and let out a deep sigh on purpose as I pretended to be
annoyed.

“You said your name was Kaya, right?”

“Y-Yes…?”

I opened my eyes and glared at her with a gaze that was even colder than
death’s embrace.

“Don’t tell anyone about me.”

“…”

Kaya froze.

She resembled a cornered deer, trembling before a beast trying to devour
her.

She was weak in front of someone who showed overwhelming skill that she
wasn’t even close to matching.

***…Let’s stop here.***

If the player took Kaya’s lover route, she was imaginative enough to
guess every word that would come from Ian’s mouth, which naturally
caused her to think badly of herself.

I quietly left the place.

I had to run away before Kaya regained her senses and said anything
else, and now that it was like this, I shouldn’t reveal my true
identity.

Luckily, she still had a frightened expression on her face.

We spoke quietly, so the students watching us shouldn’t have heard what
we were talking about.

‘But can I just leave it like this?’

***Well, it’ll probably be fine.***

✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧

“I was right…”

Kaya trembled like an aspen tree as she recalled her interaction with
Isaac.

She shuddered like a lamb that felt the fear of death in front of a
wolf.

The strength in her legs was giving out, and it seemed like even the
slightest touch would cause her to collapse.

Her beating heart continued to race faster and faster as an intense fear
rushed in like a tidal wave, gripping her entire body, and preventing
her from moving.

A warning… That was a warning.

Isaac’s red eyes were the vibrant colour of blood.

When the image of him crushing a powerful demon merged with the
hostility she had seen earlier today, it became a source of fear for
her.

Isaac was definitely hiding his true identity and judging from their
earlier conversation, he must have been pretending to be weak for
whatever reason.

“What should I do…?”

Kaya blamed herself for trying to find out more about Isaac.

To him… She had gotten on his bad side…

Chapter 6: - Class Placement Evaluation (1)
===========================================

༺ **Class Placement Evaluation (1)** ༻

In three days, there will be a class placement evaluation.

It was an event where the main character, Ian Fairytale, and one of the
heroines, Luce Eltania, would get entangled.

As for why they got involved, it was because a demon suddenly appeared.

Right before Ian and Luce fought, a demon emerged and the two joined
forces to fight the demon, and Ian ended up protecting Luce.

Ian was just protecting Luce, thinking that she was caught off guard.

Anyway, they succeeded in defeating the demon and after the class
placement evaluation was over, Luce started caring for Ian because of
the memories they formed that day.

The two of them end up dating because Luce was vulnerable to situations
where she is being protected.

‘Of course, none of this would matter if Ian were to lose again at the
beginning.’

In the first place, there was no need for Ian to protect Luce.

If Luce didn’t take the lover route, she would live with ‘living my life
my way’ as her motto and instead become a supporting character who
occasionally helped Ian. Even if Ian didn’t protect Luce, there wouldn’t
be any problems with the story.

My role was to simply defeat the demon without much thought.

By the way, even if Ian was defeated and Luce was left alone, she could
still defeat the demon.

The problem with that, however, was that it led directly to a bad
ending.

So, the key to that event was to defeat the demon as quickly as possible
and prevent a bad ending from occurring.

However, the class placement evaluation started at 2:00 PM, and the
demon wouldn’t appear until 7:00 PM.

The class placement evaluation was a survival game where everyone was an
enemy besides yourself. In that battle royale, I would have to survive
for five hours until the demon appeared while being the weakest student.

‘Firstly physical training, secondly magic training, then Introduction
to Basic Magic, and finally The Study of Elementary Ice Science…’

I started to move according to the training plan that I had drawn up in
advance.

As dusk descended, I arrived at the corner of the Butterfly Garden.

The place I had arrived at was an open area. Under the dark and gloomy
evening sky, I deeply inhaled the grassy air.

Probably because the location was so large, it was easy to find a
deserted place.

“Whoo.”

From now on, I intended to use the 1-star spell \[Ice Generation\] like
crazy.

Basic elemental magic was very useful, and it was necessary to master it
first because it was the basis of all magic.

‘\[Ice Generation\].‘

I stretched out my hands into the air and let the ice mana flow.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

I repeatedly produced ice blocks the size of soccer balls before
removing them through unfreezing.

I used up almost all the mana I was able to muster, before patiently
waiting for my mana to replenish itself and then doing it all over
again.

Despite the cold weather, beads of sweat were dripping down my body as
if I was standing in the rain – the fatigue that I had been ignoring so
far finally settled in, causing my energy to dwindle and blood to start
flowing from my nose.

Spending mana recklessly was more arduous than I thought.

Then, after two hours had passed, I headed to one of the seven gyms with
an exhausted body.

Most of the students in the Department of Magic aimed to become wizards,
so they didn’t feel the need to come to the gym.

It was much more efficient to study magic theory or increase your magic
proficiency while training your muscles in moderation for conditioning
and health.

I’d rather train according to the standards of this world, but in
&lt;Magic Knight of Märchen&gt;, having good stamina came with a variety
of benefits, both in terms of growth and overall progression of the
story. In other words, physical training was something that no one could
deny the importance of.

“Oh, oh.”

When I arrived at the gym, I saw students from the Knight Department in
sportswear exercising with great intensity.

A party of steel for men. I felt like I was going to drown in all the
testosterone that was radiating from their bodies.

‘There really isn’t anyone from the Magic Department, is there?’

Fortunately, I didn’t see any students who seemed to be from the Magic
Department after looking around for a bit.

If there were, I would have been criticized for things like ‘he’s a
commoner with Grade E mana but doesn’t train his magic and instead
chooses to do outrageous exercises, it’s clear that he doesn’t
understand what he’s studying.’

***Wouldn’t I lose all interest in exercising?***

“Ugh.”

I started with the bench press.

I put a collective 20kg of iron on the left and right of a 20kg iron
bar, for a total weight of 40kg.

I could feel the fit students of the Knight Department glancing at me.

It must have been a strange sight to see a normal-looking Magic
Department student trying to exercise.

***Let’s ignore it.***

“Uughhhh…!”

–*Haa Haaa*!

Gritting my teeth, I lifted the iron bar with all my strength.

“Ha.”

I managed to lift the iron bar up for 5 reps, then rested.

I lifted it 5 more times. Rest.

Then another 5 times. Rest.

“Blerchhhh…”

I dropped it as is. I felt like I’ve already completely overworked my
arm and chest muscles. ***Is this really my limit?***

I was staring at the ceiling for a moment when suddenly four muscular
male students rushed towards me.

“Are you a student at the Magic Department?”

***Oh, man, it’s intimidating to be surrounded by such muscular
individuals.***

It was natural for them to notice that I was in the Magic Department,
since the navy blue sweatshirt I was wearing right now was for the Magic
Department.

But what were students of the Knight Department doing here?

“Yeah, what about it…?”

“Why exercise…? Are you an aspiring Magic Knight…?”

I wasn’t able to think much because I was tired, so after taking a deep
breath I just told them the first thing that came to mind.

“I just want to become stronger…”

“……!!”

The eyes of the male students from the Knight Department lit up.

***How did… the atmosphere become like this…?***

“I know that feeling very well…!”

“To think there would be a person with such a wonderful mindset in the
Magic Department…! Yes! If you want to be strong in magic or whatever
else, exercise is essential!

“Can we teach you how to properly exercise?”

***What…?***

***Are you guys saying you want to become my personal trainers, right
now?***

Before I came to this world, I would frequently go to the gym and I
would always hear that getting a personal trainer was an effective way
of helping you exercise, but they were too expensive for me to even
think of hiring one.

The students from the Knight Department had better muscles than any
personal trainer I had ever seen so it seemed like a good idea to accept
their proposal.

“I’d appreciate it if you could.”

“……!”

Soon I would regret those words.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

The muscles all over my body were screaming in pain.

I couldn’t even walk properly.

“Ughguk…”

The training of the Knight Department students could only be described
as hell. ‘You’re doing great! Good! Great! One more rep, one more rep!’
I forcibly lifted the iron while thinking I was going to die.

The effect was certain as every single one of my muscle cells were
aching.

They wanted to see me again tomorrow, it seems they had fun teaching me
how to exercise.

There was no immediate change in stamina and strength, it seemed that
they would only increase after new muscle tissues were formed.

‘Ahhh…’

My body had reached its limit.

Seriously… I barely made it to the dormitory, after crawling like a
drunk.

I had to study now… but my stamina didn’t last…

As soon as I entered the room, I kicked the bucket, and fell asleep on
the floor before I even got to bed.

It was difficult to expect dramatic changes in just three days but I did
grow a little.

As a result of training, my level rose by 1. I invested the newly
acquired 2 stats in \[Magic Training Efficiency\] and thanks to that, my
\[Magic Training Efficiency\] went up from C- to C.

My abilities also increased and my mana was raised by 20.

\[Mana Recovery Speed\], \[Stamina\], \[Strength\], \[Intelligence\],
\[Elemental Firepower\], and \[Elemental Efficiency\] also rose by one
level each.

‘I’m seeing less growth than when I was playing the game.’

It seemed impossible for me to grow as fast as when I was playing the
game as Ian. It was probably a matter of overall potential, so it would
be clear to anybody that I was the weakest student at the academy with
Grade E mana.

However, if I kept raising \[Physical Training Efficiency\] and
\[Magical Training Efficiency\], my growth rate would skyrocket later.

‘The preparations are…’

I prepared for the class placement evaluation by buying 10 slingshots,
magic pouches, a few magic tools, and a Magic Cloak of Disguise.

The slingshot was easily obtainable at the general store, and the magic
tools at the magic tool store. However, the magic tools were a little on
the expensive side.

The Cloak of Disguise could only be bought at a secret shop, which
required taking a secret route to find, since ordinary magic tool stores
only sold perception-impairing glasses.

Perception-impairing glasses only made it difficult to distinguish
faces, but did not hide physique or voice.

On the other hand, the Cloak of Disguise could completely change the
physique and voice of the wearer, effectively making them look like a
different person. The reason for this lied in the optical illusion cast
upon it, which altered the perception of those who looked at it.

If I wore this outfit, I would be able to hide myself in front of Luce’s
sharp eyes and photographic memory, since if she realized my true
identity, she would report it to the academy’s office, and inevitably,
it would reach the ears of the student council president.

‘It’s very expensive…’

Just like one would expect from the secret store, the Magic Cloak of
Disguise cost me a sizable 3000 gels.

Fortunately, I had just enough after eating nothing but a 10 gel piece
of bread every day, I wouldn’t have been able to afford it otherwise.

In the end, I was robbed of all my fortune…

However, depending on the results of the class placement evaluation, the
gel allocated would increase, so I had no choice but to get a decent
grade.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

“We will start the class placement evaluation today.”

It was the day of the class placement evaluation.

The midday sky was clear and blue.

The Magic Department’s Provisional 3rd Class had arrived in front of a
dense forest located on the west side of the academy, the forest was
called ‘Delphine Forest’.

There, Professor Fernando faced the Provisional 3rd Class while standing
in an orderly manner.

“The rules are simple, all you have to do is find as many mana grains as
you can within the allotted time. They are hidden throughout the
‘Delphine Forest’, and if you bring the watch I gave you close to the
mana grains, they will naturally attach themselves to it. The mana
grains cannot be removed from the watch once they are attached.”

The contents of Märchen Academy’s performance evaluations and exams
changed every year, and they were all revealed on the same day. In other
words, this was the first time the students heard the contents of the
class placement evaluation.

I looked down at the watch on my left wrist.

The hour and minute hands indicated that it was currently 1:30 PM.

My name, ‘Isaac’, was engraved on the watchband in magical characters. I
just have to bring this closer to the mana grains.

Mana grains emitted weak mana, making them difficult to detect. In other
words, the most important thing in this class placement evaluation was
mana perception.

For reference, mana could only be detected if it was emitted, meaning
even a person with excellent mana perception couldn’t detect mana from
Luce Eltania when she wasn’t using magic.

Mana perception that was sensitive enough to detect mana that wasn’t
being released, was in the realm of an Archwizard.

“Mana perception? That’s easy.”

“It is simple.”

“I am confident.”

The students listened to the exam contents, shrugged their shoulders,
and started chattering.

These were the students who would soon be terrified after hearing
Professor Fernando’s explanation, which would follow.

“Also, if the watch is removed from the wrist for any reason, a signal
is sent to us immediately and the student is eliminated. It is also
possible to steal another student’s watch. A student who succeeds in
stealing a watch will receive additional points equal to the level of
the opponent’s mana. In a word, it’s a ‘survival’ game, any means of
collecting points is acceptable, so be careful since all first-year
students of the Magic Department will be participating.

The students were startled and started whispering.

“Was it a survival game?! What should I do? I’m weak…”

“If I get caught by someone like Luce Eltania, won’t I just die? It’s
all luck…”

“On the other hand, if I get a Grade E like Isaac, I will be lucky.”

“No, even if you do catch him, his magic power is Grade E so you
wouldn’t receive a lot of extra points.”

If you caught Luce Eltania, who had Grade A+ mana, or Kaya Astrean, who
had Grade B+, you will receive an enormous bonus. Then not only would
you get into a good class, but you would also earn a lot of gel. Of
course, there was no way I would be able to pull something like that
off.

On the other hand, Ian Fairytale, who had Grade E mana, would only net
you a small number of points if you caught him…

***Ian will be targeted by many students because he’s Grade E, but what
about me? I can already see the dark future ahead of me.***

At least Ian’s fighting skills and physical abilities were excellent, so
he wouldn’t be defeated easily. This was the reason he could hold out
until 7 P.M. when the demon appeared.

On the other hand, I was as good as doomed.

“Professor, what if an outsider breaks in during the exam? It’s in the
forest, so I’m afraid I might meet a strange person…”

A female student asked Professor Fernando.

“When all the students enter the forest, a barrier is set. No one will
be allowed inside during the test, so don’t worry about threats from the
outside.”

That’s right, the test was safe from external threats. Except the demon
came from within the forest.

Besides, once you got eliminated and left the forest, you wouldn’t be
able to re-enter until after the exam had ended.

Afterward, the question ‘What about the bathroom?’ came up, and
Professor Fernando simply answered, ‘Do it yourself’.

“Then you will enter in numerical order starting from the number 1.”

Student number 1 entered Delphine Forest and with a bit of time
difference between them, all the students started entering as well.

Other provisional class students must have entered like this from the
other side of the Delphine Forest.

Finally, on number 25, I also entered the Delphine Forest.

The class placement evaluation began at 2:00 PM and the demon will
appear at 7:00 PM.

‘Let’s do it…’

***I have to endure for 5 hours in a survival game with only people
stronger than me.***

Recalling that fact, I held my breath and maintained my tension.

Before I knew it, a barrier was drawn around Delphine Forest, and a
firecracker exploded in the sky.

The class placement evaluation had begun.

<span id="0006_7_-_Class_Placement_Evaluation_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 7: - Class Placement Evaluation (2)
===========================================

༺ **Class Placement Evaluation (2)** ༻

The class placement evaluation.

In Märchen Academy, there were four classes: A, B, C, and D. The
top-scoring students were assigned to Class A, while the lowest-scoring
students were assigned to Class D.

The results of the mana measurement and the class placement evaluation
determined which class a student would be assigned to.

As it was a test determining which class you would belong to for the
entire semester, the class placement evaluation was of great importance.

My top priority was defeating the demons rather than worrying about my
ranking.

Currently, all the first-year students of the Magic Department were in
Delphine Forest.

That meant the risk of meeting other students soon was high, meaning
there was a high probability of an immediate battle.

This was the ripple effect brought about by the word ‘survival’
mentioned by the professor. Most students knew that they had to fight
when they run into each other.

*Bang─!!*

*Roaaaar—!!*

*Kwaaaaaaa─!!*

The sound of magic firing and smashing from all directions alerted
everyone that the Battle Royale had begun.

In such a situation, it was only natural for students to band together
to not only gain a numerical advantage but to also find mana grains more
easily, which was the purpose of this test.

However, there was no one merciful enough to team up with me, a person
with Grade E mana. If anything, I would be fortunate as long as they
didn’t try to take advantage of me.

***Can I at least rely on Kaya, who has a misunderstanding about my
strength?***

…No. There were far too many variables to consider. There was no
guarantee that Kaya would help me, and there was also a high risk that
my true nature would be revealed, as well as the possibility of her
stabbing me in the back for being dangerous.

If that was the case, I had only one choice.

‘I think…’

***I’ll just hide.***

I saw a tree with thick leaves that looked perfect to hide in, it was
the place I decided on after looking around Delphine Forest in advance.

I took a magic pouch out of my pocket.

\[Magic Pouch\] A small pouch that stores many items using magic. Good
portability.

Rank: Tier 6

Rank Tier 6. A tier was a unit of measurement for determining the rarity
of an item, and the lower the number, the rarer it was.

I took a water bottle from my magic pouch and sprayed water on the tree.
In addition, I used the \[Ice Generation\] skill to create a crude ice
staircase.

My \[Elemental Synergy\] was at a rather high level compared to my other
stats. The higher the \[Elemental Synergy\], the greater the effect that
would appear when my elemental magic overlapped with another element.

Thanks to this, I was able to create a bigger block of ice than when I
used the \[Ice Generation\] skill normally.

I stepped on the ice staircase and finally climbed up the tree.

‘It’s comfy.’

As I sat on a thick branch surrounded by a cluster of leaves, I leaned
my back against the tree and defrosted the ice staircase.

“…”

This was the only strategy that I, the weakest student could use,
‘fuckin’ hold’^1^E/N: From what I understand ‘Fuckin’ hold’ is a
reference to Starcraft’s Zerg Burrowing Mechanics, basically it means to
persevere through anything., but what would I do if other students
completely cleared out all the mana grains while I was hiding in a tree?

***Okay, so I overlooked something in this class placement
evaluation.***

‘Mana grains are luminescent. When it gets dark, it becomes easier to
distinguish with the naked eye.’

As someone with low mana perception, it would be better to go looking
for the mana grains later anyways.

I stayed still and focused on listening to my surroundings, to check if
there were any signs of people approaching.

20 minutes later, I felt a presence. Someone was coming this way.

I reached for a frozen slingshot that I had placed out of sight within
the tree.

\[Slingshot\] An ordinary slingshot made of wood and a rubber band. Weak
durability.

Rank: Tier 9

The slingshot was fixed by attaching stones to a rubber band and
freezing it while stretching the rubber band as far back as it could
possibly go.

A total of 10 slingshots were installed and I memorized each location.

‘Defrost.’

When I loosened the ice that was holding the slingshot rubber band, it
turned into blue powder and scattered while the slingshot fired stones.

*Whiiiik—*

The stone from the slingshot sliced through the air, cut through the
grass, and landed on the ground.

“Huhhhhh?!”

I heard the surprised exclamation of a girl.

She moved her gaze to the stone that had flown out from the grass, and
appeared to be rather confident in her abilities as she immediately
prepared for a fight.

There were now 9 slingshots left.

‘Let’s hold on…’

The constant tension kept me from getting bored.

***Please, I only hope that I can hold out until the time is right.***

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

The sky was dyed the color of the sunset.

The sound of the students casting magic had long since faded away, and
silence descended upon the forest.

The current time was 6:30 PM, and I was still alive, hiding in a tree.

‘Should I sneak down now?’

Fortunately, the ‘fuckin’ hold’ strategy worked.

I ended up using all 10 slingshots, but I didn’t see it as a waste since
each one performed their role faithfully.

After taking out the water bottle from the magic pouch, I poured the
remaining water from it on the tree and then used \[Ice Generation\] to
create ice in a cascading fashion.

As expected, it was difficult to control, so a sloppy staircase was
created.

I carefully climbed downed the icy steps.

“Oh god.”

It felt like forever since I last put my feet on the ground, and my legs
were trembling from sitting in the tree for 4 hours. It didn’t help that
I still had muscle pain from the gym yesterday.

After massaging my legs, I dispelled my magic to remove the ice
staircase.

Now I had to get moving.

‘Where are they?’

I didn’t know where Ian and Luce would end up fighting the demon.

In the game, you would get a cutscene after surviving the class
placement evaluation. This was the scene where Ian and Luce first met,
and the scenery changed automatically.

I needed to find that location quickly.

The sky above the barrier was gradually darkening as I moved forward
with caution, trying to make as little noise as possible.

‘I have to look for some mana grains.’

I was robbed of all my fortune in preparation for the class placement
evaluation. If I couldn’t earn enough gel here, I would have no choice
but to starve or take out a loan from a bank and become a debtor.

So finding any leftover mana grains was also important.

‘…Did I mess up?’

Ha, damn it, not a single mana grain was visible, the students must have
cleared them all out.

My hope of easily finding any remaining mana grains after it had become
dark was completely shattered.

I had overlooked something, this was the prestigious Märchen Academy.

It was only natural that the students had excellent mana perception.

‘Please, I also need some mana grains…’

I became so engrossed in searching for mana grains that I had failed to
recognize the sound of small footsteps approaching me.

“Huh?”

A woman’s voice rang out in front of me and in an instant, my heart
sank.

I, who had been bending down while searching for mana grains, froze
while a drop of cold sweat ran down my cheek.

‘What do I do, what do I do…?’

***Let’s think.***

I still had some magic tools I purchased before, if I fought using them,
it would be possible to overcome the level difference to some extent.

If the person in front of me had a level in the 30s or 40s, wouldn’t it
be worth trying?

I slowly raised my head and looked at the female student standing in
front of me.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 90

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

“…”

“…”

***What should I say?***

***Hmm.***

***Wait. Kaya?***

“Ah, ah, how are you…?”

“…”

Kaya seemed very frightened, as both her voice and body were trembling.

She was the freshmen’s second seat. It was impossible for me to defeat
her, even if I used every trick up my sleeve.

However, she currently thought of me as a ‘powerful man who had attained
the level of an Archwizard, but was concealing his power.’

***Let’s think and act calmly, if I use that fact to my advantage, I
might be able to get out of here safely.***

“Move.”

I had always been confident in my acting skills.

I consequently narrowed my eyes and spoke in a cold, authoritative tone,
as if I were revealing my true colors.

I acted as if I wasn’t nervous at all.

“Ah…! Yes, pardon me…!”

Kaya trembled and moved out of the way.

Alright, I just had to move on like this.

I started walking slowly.

A feeling of relief washed over me.

***I’m glad nothing went wrong…***

“Ah, Sir Isaac…!”

Suddenly, Kaya called me.

‘What is ‘Sir’ Isaac?’

I didn’t expect her to use such an embarrassing honorific, but then I
thought it was only natural considering what Kaya thought of me.

I quickly composed myself.

I stopped and looked back at Kaya with a cold expression, and heard.

“Well, this is still a test so… Why don’t we fight…?”

“…”

***…No.***

“Of course, to Sir Isaac, who has reached the level of an Archwizard,
someone like me would be akin to an ant under the ground… But even then,
I still wish to fight you!”

***No, don’t do that, relax your determined expression.***

“Please do me this favor, Sir Isaac!”

***No, don’t deploy your magic circle, it’s not like we already agreed
to fight, so get rid of it.***

***…Please.***

‘In another 20 minutes, the demon will appear…’

Before I knew it, the test clock was pointing at 6:40 PM which meant I
needed to quickly find where the demon would appear.

Despite my pleas, Kaya’s light green magic circle deployed in the air
was slowly spinning toward me.

Even though she was afraid of me, the second seat was burning with a
desire to fight against the gigantic existence known as an Archwizard.

“……”

***I am weak, I have Grade E mana, the lowest grade! I am the weakest
student of the Department of Magic…! No matter what I do, I can’t
win…!***

***Calm down for now, calm down and think.***

How could I get out of this situation? What could I tell her in order
for her to dispel her magic circle?

I couldn’t just say that I was the one in charge of the demons. No
matter how hard I try, I couldn’t even imagine how much of a headache
that would become for me in the future.

***Then what I can do… What can I take advantage of…***

…I thought of something.

***I don’t know if this will work, but let’s give it a shot.***

“Whew.”

“…?”

I started with a sigh.

That magic circle looked dangerous, no matter how I looked at it, but I
stared at Kaya with the most amused expression I could muster, and
similarly, Kaya was looking at me with a dubious expression.

Since this has already happened, it was all or nothing.

I crossed my arms and looked at the pale green magic circle that Kaya
deployed in the air as if it were pathetic.

“With only that kind of magic?”

“…!!”

Kaya’s eyes widened in shock. What I said must have hurt her feelings.

“Only that kind…?”

“You’re wasting your time right now.”

I turned my back.

A terrifying, murderous feeling came from behind.

***Please don’t kill me…***

“I know you are an amazing person. But… what you said just now ignores
all the blood, sweat, and tears I’ve put in…”

“I mean, ‘for now.’”

“Huh?”

The situation changed quickly.

I felt my life fading away. Perhaps Kaya was trying to figure out what I
meant.

“You’re close with ‘Sylphia,’ right?”

Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy. It was the name of a fairy who used plant
magic.

“H-how did you know that…?”

“Because I can sense the aura of \[Yggdrasil\] from you.”

“…!!”

Even though I didn’t look at her, I could feel that Kaya was very
surprised.

The aura of \[Yggdrasil\]? What’s that? I was just bluffing. How could I
sense that when I couldn’t even sense mana grains?

Anyway, Kaya was on good terms with Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy. It was a
secret that only she knew, and couldn’t be found out by anyone else.

She also wore the ‘Seed of Yggdrasil’ she received from Sylphia as a
necklace around her neck. Kaya had to keep the seed with her at all
times in order to access its plant mana.

At first glance, it appeared to be a regular seed, but unlike a regular
seed, it was constantly condensing mana rather than emitting it, making
it difficult to detect.

After entering her second year, she became fully attuned to the plant
mana. Later on, she was able to use the ‘Seed of Yggdrasil’ as a
catalyst to cast the 8-star plant spell \[Yggdrasil\], which contained
both a fairy’s power and the capability to destroy a nation.

Only I, who was familiar with the future, could say this now.

“It seems to be quite recognizable.”

“Did you know Sylphia?!”

***Of course not.***

But I didn’t answer on purpose and kept my eyes closed, pretending to
reminisce about a great past.

“…Your true value will be revealed in the future. When that happens, if
you become someone worth my time, I’ll face you one day.”

“…”

After that, I started walking again.

I didn’t know what kind of expression Kaya was making behind me, and I
didn’t know what thoughts were racing through her mind.

It didn’t matter. What really mattered was the little noise caused by
the magic circle subsided and then disappeared. Kaya had dispersed her
magic circle!

A smile leaked out from the corners of my mouth. It was relief at being
alive.

I was bluffing like a middle schooler, but I was glad things worked out
anyway…

“Sir Isaac.”

***Oh, not again, why, why!?***

I tried to pretend I hadn’t heard, but Kaya called out once more, “Sir
Isaac!” and forced me to a halt.

“Why are you here ‘pretending to be weak’?”

Certainly, that was a question worth asking.

Even though, I was really just weak.

But in Kaya’s eyes, I was pretending to be a weakling.

Well, that’s easy.

There was only one response I could give here.

“…You don’t need to know.”

That was it. In this situation, the typical response from the other
person would be to just remain silent and nod.

And then, I started walking again. As expected, Kaya didn’t call out to
me again.

After walking for a while, when I looked back, she was out of sight.

“Wheeeeeew—”

I let out a very, very deep sigh of relief.

*Kiyaaa\~ I’m alive! I’m not dead.*

I was lucky. Hmm, it’s really awesome!

But now was not the time to be immersed in the joy of survival.

I calmed down and steeled myself. I needed to find the place where the
demon would appear, as well as where Ian and Luce would meet.

***Where are you? Where?***

***…I found a mana grain. Let’s pick it up.***

When I brought my watch near it, the mana grain flew off the stone like
a firefly and stuck itself to the watch.

‘There are only 10 minutes left.’

It was currently 6:50 PM, meaning the demon would appear in 10 minutes.

I retraced my steps.

The only clue I had was that the demon would appear in an empty lot with
a low cliff.

I looked around Delphine Forest yesterday, but I couldn’t find an area
that matched that description due to the forest being so large.

I had to find it.

It will most likely be difficult to find it in time. If so…

I arrived at a stream that I had memorized the location of during my
preliminary search. I could see the sky clearly from here, no matter how
dense the trees were in the Delphine Forest.

Then I took a look at my wristwatch.

‘7 o’clock…’

A dark blue hue dyed the sky as the sunset faded.

By now, the demon should have appeared in front of Ian and Luce.

It would be a waste of time to wander around here.

***Let’s put the search for mana grains aside for a moment. My number
one priority is to avoid a bad ending.***

I decided to stay where I was.

Certainly, when Ian and Luce begin to fight the demon, there would be a
significant scale of magic involved.

I just needed to head to the location where the spells were being cast.

It was entirely possible for me to move further away from the fight if I
were to continue wandering around.

***Let’s wait a little bit.***

***Just a little bit…***

“…”

In the forest, which was gradually turning dark, I stood still and held
my breath.

*KUUUUUUUU─────!!!*

“…!!”

A roar erupted.

I jerked my head in the direction of the roar. Since I was near a
stream, there were no trees blocking my view, making the loud noise
easily identifiable.

A sharp pillar of ice rose a short distance away. The pillar was pitch
black rather than the cool blue normal ice would have.

Others may have been unaware, but I was certain that an ice spell with
the darkness element had been cast. It was, without a doubt, the magic
of demons.

The ice pillar instantly disintegrated into black powder and
disappeared.

I hurried towards the location where the black ice pillar had risen.

***Please hold on until I arrive, Ian! It would be even better if you
win!***

“Whoa. Where are you going in such a hurry?”

***No, no.***

***Ughhhh…***

“…What is it, huh. Aren’t you a lowly commoner with Grade E mana?”

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 71

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind

**Danger:** Medium

The person who stood in my way was Tristan Humphrey, a high-ranking
freshman, and a conceited blonde aristocrat.

“…”

I shook my head rapidly.

Thanks to playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ so much, I kept all the
characteristics of the main characters in my head.

My level was 26, the level difference between me and this guy was 45,
but… If I did my best, I think I could beat him. I wasn’t sure about
others, though.

***Let’s take him down quickly.***

‘I’ll be passing through now.’

I accelerated the flow of mana in my body, warming up my ice mana.

    Starcraft’s Zerg Burrowing Mechanics, basically it means to

Chapter 8: - Class Placement Evaluation (3)
===========================================

༺ **Class Placement Evaluation (3)**༻

“You managed to survive this far, Grade E commoner, Oh, it seems there’s
a mana grain on your watch… Only one? Ho-ho, were you so desperate to
survive that you hid the entire time?

***…That’s quite intuitive.***

“And on top of that, your mana perception must be atrocious! How
pitiful!”

***Isn’t it a cowardly move to hit me with facts?***

Well, even though he looked like an asshole, it was an obvious fact that
he was far superior to me in terms of skill.

If I fight him head-to-head with magic, I would lose 100 out of 100
times.

But I needed to get past him somehow.

I didn’t know what was going on with Ian right now, maybe the worst-case
scenario had already happened. I couldn’t let myself have a bad ending
because of him.

I secretly inserted one of my fingers into the magic pouch in my back
pocket, and a magic tool in the form of a small glass bottle was caught
by my finger.

As I saw during the magic power evaluation, Tristan Humphrey’s magic was
quite powerful, but he was inexperienced in defending himself since he
solely focused on attacking rather than defending.

He disliked the combat style that involved carefully deploying defensive
magic while fighting.

He was a man who had only mastered attack magic with the mindset of ‘the
best defense is a good offense.’

It was a mindset born out of the lack of practical experience. The
servants of the Humphrey family supported and raised him without giving
him any hands-on experience. In fact, this class placement evaluation
was probably his debut stage.

“You aren’t even trying to run away when I’m in front of you? You’re
just a Grade E commoner, where does such unfounded confidence even come
from? Or, are you petrified from fear?

“Hahaha—” Tristan laughed heartily before coughing and gasping due to
swallowing his saliva incorrectly.

Maybe it was because I had been playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ for a
long time, but even Tristan’s third-rate villain lines felt familiar.

Still, I had to knock him down and get past him.

‘Because I know him well.’

***It’s possible.***

I threw the small glass bottle in my hand to the ground.

*Clink-!*

The small glass bottle collided with a stone and broke, releasing the
hazy mist that had condensed in it.

*Suuuuuuuuuu──*

\[Processed Fog\] When the bottle is shattered, it instantly generates a
dense fog of the water element. The effect lasts for 20 seconds.

Rank: Tier 7

“Fog?”

The magic tool I broke was a water element item, ‘Processed Fog’.

It created a hazy fog around itself in an instant, similar to a smoke
bomb.

However, this was insufficient, as Tristan and I could still see one
another’s movements if we looked closely.

I stretched out my right hand and spread pure white, cold air.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

The dense fog immediately turned colder, and even whiter. As the air
cooled, condensation occurred and formed advection fog, becoming denser
and thicker.

I channelled ice mana with my other hand.

Ian and Luce must have joined forces by now. They should be headed
toward the place where they fought the demon.

At that time.

“……!”

*Whooooosh!!*

A sharp, light green wind sliced through the dense fog and grazed me
with only a few inches to spare.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

I froze on the spot.

I was almost done for…

“Haha, is there nothing you can do other than play jokes like this?”

As Tristan approached me, he conjured a magic circle in front of his
hand, scattering a pale green light.

*Whoooosh.*

The wind began to blow in all directions, clearing the fog. The wind was
caused by Tristan.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

The wind element was distinguished by a combo that continuously
generated wind, consequently increasing the magic output.

In other words, he intended to hunt me down in earnest.

“I already knew this was the outcome!”

However, as the fog cleared, I reached out my hand towards Tristan.

I had already begun forming ice from the moment the fog spread.

Then I clenched my fist, my palm glowing with a blue light.

The flow of mana was severed by me, causing the large chunk of ice that
had formed over Tristan’s head to rapidly fall to the ground.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

“…Huh?”

─*Crack!*

A heavy noise echoed eerily throughout the forest as the block of ice,
pulled down by gravity, fell directly on Tristan’s head.

“Ugh!!”

With a single blood-curdling shriek, Tristan collapsed.

The block of ice that struck him was bigger than what I usually made,
thanks to \[Elemental Synergy\] and the water element from the
‘Processed Fog’.

Soon, Tristan’s wind died down and the fog dissipated.

I could clearly see Tristan lying on the floor, with blood dripping from
his head.

Having suffered a humiliating defeat from a Grade E commoner that he had
ignored for so long, he might as well start practicing defensive magic
from now on.

‘Time is running out…’

I looked at my watch and reminded myself of the urgent situation.

As much as I wanted Tristan’s watch to earn points, it wasn’t worth the
time I would have to spend taking it away.

I made up my mind and started running toward my destination once again.

The trigger for this bad ending wasn’t Ian’s death.

It was actually when Luce summoned her familiar to defeat the demon.

Her familiar was the 8-star magic beast, ‘Thunderbird – Galia’.

As with magic, the highest grade for familiars was 9-stars, which was on
the level of world destruction. And Galia was the strongest familiar of
the grade just below that, national destruction.

The problem was that she couldn’t control Galia.

Originally, a magic beast who became a familiar must faithfully follow
their master’s every word, but Galia could not be controlled, lightly
disregarded her orders, and even went as far as willingly accepting the
penalty for disobeying said orders.

If Galia manifested here, all of the talented students who had survived
so far during the class placement evaluation would perish.

Currently, there were only first-year students from the Magic Department
in the forest, and Galia’s lightning strike would engulf the forest
before the academy could respond.

It was no surprise that the protagonist who was still trapped in the
forest, Ian, would die.

Galia was one of the greatest powers in Märchen Academy, after all.

The situation eventually settled down after Dorothy Heartnova, a
sophomore in the Magic Department called the Star Witch, managed to
repel the Thunderbird – Galia. However, many people, including Ian, had
already died.

In other words, it was a bad ending.

‘Please don’t be too late…!’

Even though I was out of breath, I ran with all my might.

✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧⋄⋆⋅⋆⋄✧

“How dare you… wound this body…!”

Tristan reached out in the direction Isaac had left.

There was dirt covering his entire body as he was collapsed on the
ground, blood pouring from his head.

In front of his hand, a light green magic circle was conjured and slowly
started to rotate.

If he continued to pour his mana into the magic circle and fired the
long-range attack magic \[Whirlwind\], it might have even reached Isaac.

“To the hands of a lowly Grade E commoner… an insignificant Grade E
commoner!!”

Tristan struggled to resist the urge to lose consciousness and poured
his mana toward the departed Isaac.

「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」

*Wooooosh───!!*

A light green wind began to whirl and swirl with strong momentum.

But.

─────*Woooooooosh!!*

The whirlwind, which was about to crush the trees and move towards
Isaac, was devoured by a more powerful whirlwind coming from the side.

Tristan’s eyes widened.

A female student who blew a much stronger \[Whirlwind\] against his
\[Whirlwind\] walked out from the darkness of the forest.

Her light green pigtails fluttered along with her footsteps, and her
jade-colored eyes were brilliantly vibrant even in the slowly darkening
forest.

It was Kaya Astrean, the second seat freshmen in the Magic Department.

“Uh, why are you…?”

As if not interested in Tristan’s question, Kaya quietly closed her
eyes.

“Haah.”

She took a deep breath and began to ponder.

He’s weak.

So weak, that he wasn’t even worthy of Sir Isaac’s sincerity.

Isaac had sensed the mana contained in Yggdrasil’s seed.

Even though she was always carrying the seed with her, she couldn’t even
sense the mana…

The ability to sense mana that wasn’t being emitted was famous for being
in the realm of an Archwizard.

Isaac had proven once again that he was someone whose skill couldn’t be
surpassed by someone like herself.

‘Sir Isaac is amazing.’

Only that kind of power?

It was only natural he said that.

She must have seemed so insignificant to such an amazing person.

If she wanted to compete with Isaac and his natural talent, it was only
polite to at least meet a certain threshold.

Rather, challenging him with her mediocre skills was equivalent to
disrespecting him.

It was akin to a young child challenging an adult knight to a fight, of
course, the knight would say. ‘Come back once you’ve grown up.’

“I’m going to be strong enough to make Sir Isaac recognize me.”

Kaya slowly opened her eyes as her resolve burned quietly like embers.

“Why… did you cover for that Grade E commoner?”

Tristan asked in a trembling voice as if he didn’t know why.

“It’s only natural I do so, that’s why.”

Kaya replied with a sigh mixed with a pitiful voice.

*Whoooooooooosh─────*

The wind generated by Kaya started swirling around her.

Kaya’s \[Wind Generation\] had a stronger mana concentration than
Tristan’s \[Wind Generation\], and was thus stronger.

Her light green pigtails and the hem of her school uniform began to
flutter wildly.

A face covered in the darkness of the forest, eyes looking down with
displeasure.

Tristan looked at her with a face full of doubts and fear.

Tristan wondered, why was she protecting Isaac and fighting him?

“Even I have never touched Isaac, what makes someone like you think you
can?”

It was a simple matter of pride.

The wind around Kaya swirled violently and soon, Tristan’s body floated
above the twilight forest.

The twilight of the evening sky was truly beautiful – with that feeling,
his consciousness faded far beyond the distant horizon.

Meanwhile.

Dried dirt covered Luce Eltania’s rose-gold hair and the school uniform
she was wearing.

She calmed herself in front of the bizarre-looking demon whose
appearance was akin to a man wearing loose-fitting and navy blue
clothes, it was standing before her as if it were a statue.

He had gray skin and a lean, muscular body. Both of his eyes were
tightly shut with one hand under his chin, and his head slightly bowed.
He appeared to be contemplating something.

*\[Hmm—, Hmm—, Hmm—, Hmm—, Hhm—, Hhm—, Hhm—, Hhm—, Hhm—, Hhm—, Hm—\]*

The constant buzzing that resonated in Luce’s head had started a while
ago.

Ian Fairytale, who fought this strange demon with her, had already lost
his consciousness.

“Please die.”

Luce lightly waved her arm and poured out her mana.

Then, a magic circle that was glowing blue formed under the demon’s
feet, and hot water quickly gushed out into the sky.

「Geyser (Water Element, ★4)」

────*Pyuuuuuuuuu!!*

The sight of the demon gracefully avoiding Luce’s magic did not match
his stiff appearance.

Even during the evasive action, he still looked like he was in deep
contemplation.

The hot fountain soared powerfully, as if it would pierce the sky
itself.

Luce knew how the demon would avoid it, and deliberately adjusted the
angle.

She directed the demon’s escape path and activated her magic there as
well.

「Seawater Prison (Water Element, ★4)」

In an instant, a round dome made of water appeared and imprisoned the
demon.

The \[Seawater Prison\] quickly froze over.

*Cracking—————*

*\[Hmm—, hmm—, hmm—, hmm—, hmm—, hmm—, hmm—\]*

The demon casually smashed the frozen \[Seawater Prison\] and escaped.

“My water magic alone isn’t enough…”

Luce monologued in a voice as serene as the moonlight.

Ice magic, enough to instantly freeze the \[Seawater Prison\] and
neutralize it. It was proof that the demon’s ice magic proficiency and
\[Elemental Synergy\] were extremely high.

That demon was too strong for Luce to handle with water magic alone.

\[Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!\]

Suddenly, the demon began humming loudly.

A large, light blue magic circle formed behind him, with elegant ice
crystals floating around it.

Alarm bells were going off in Luce’s head, telling her that this was
dangerous*—*

He suddenly took a step forward.

The ground began to freeze from the tips of his toes.

*Charaaaaaaaaaaaa*———!!

The cold air rose like a blizzard, quickly spreading along the ground in
the shape of a fan, the areas where the cold air passed through froze,
becoming smooth sheets of ice.

「Frost Wave (Ice Element, ★6)」

Luce hurriedly deployed a \[Water Wall\], a water element defense spell,
around herself.

A circular water barrier formed and shielded her from the cold wind.

「Water Wall (Water Element, ★4)」

“Ugh!”

A powerful surge of cold air attempted to freeze the water barrier that
surrounded Luce.

She countered the cooling by squeezing out her mana, accelerating the
flow of water that formed the \[Water Wall\].

The cold air rushed past the \[Water Wall\] and transformed the forest
behind it into an ice-age landscape.

The \[Frost Wave\] eventually lost momentum and calmed down.

Luce let out a white breath in the cold air as she released the \[Water
Wall\].

“… ”

She inhaled deeply and scanned the demon with eyes that reflected the
blue ocean.

Her water elemental magic wasn’t enough to defeat that demon on its own.

Her most powerful elemental magic was ‘Lightning’, and she was certain
that she would win even against unfavorable odds.

But… In order to use lightning magic properly, she would have no choice
but to summon something that should never be called upon. One-half of
her mana was always used to keep ‘that guy’ at bay.

Luce rolled up the sleeves of her school uniform and looked down at the
magic circle engraved on her left wrist.

***If I summon ‘that guy’, I can definitely defeat this stupid
gray-skinned demon.***

But… ‘That guy’ is a double-edged sword, and I’m not sure if I can
control him yet.

However, she had become much stronger, to the extent that she entered
the prestigious Märchen Academy’s Magic Department at the top of her
class. Even her mana was rated A+.

‘Galia…’

She thought that she might be able to control him now.

“Haah.”

Her heart throbbed, but after taking a deep breath and calming her tense
emotions, Luce finally made up her mind.

***The 8-star magic beast, ‘Thunderbird – Galia.’ Let’s summon that
guy.***

Just then, when Luce tried chanting the summoning spell with her index
and middle fingers pointing at the magic circle engraved on her wrist –

*Thud*.

– She heard the sound of footsteps. Although it might have been an
illusion, it seemed to have been made with the intention of being heard.

Luce turned her head towards the sound.

On the surrounding low cliffs, a man stood in a navy blue hooded coat.
His entire body was toned, and he appeared to be at least two meters
tall.

The inside of the haggard hood revealed fierce, blood-red eyes, and just
below that was a large, grotesque mouth.

The mouth had its gums exposed with large, sharp teeth neatly aligning
them, the jutting canines and large molars were especially terrifying.

Because of the worn-down hood, it was difficult to tell, but he seemed
to have pitch-black skin.

*\[Grrrrrrrr…\]*

It was like a beast, a magic beast.

She never thought another dangerous-looking monster would emerge from
here…

Now she really had no choice but to summon the Thunderbird – Galia.

“…?”

Something was off.

The monster standing on the cliff’s eyes were not on Luce, but on the
gray-skinned demon.

The demon also stopped his contemplative pose and stared at the monster
with both eyes raised, it was clearly on guard.

For some reason… the atmosphere seemed like the monsters were trying to
fight.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

I think I bought the wrong clothes.

I didn’t have a choice in the matter, however, as I just bought the one
that the owner of the secret shop said they had left, but it turned out
to be ‘Magic Cloak of Disguise – Berserker’…

I was now dressed in a navy blue hooded coat with the hood pulled down.
My face was full of sharp teeth, large fangs, and molars neatly aligned
in the corners of my mouth, it was possible because it was magic
camouflage.

From my perspective I looked normal, but to others I would appear as a
big monster standing on the cliff’s edge. I looked to and from Luce and
the demon, but Luce’s expression was unusual.

Well… It was a reasonable reaction considering my current appearance.

‘But Ian is passed out again.’

Ian was leaning against a tree, seemingly unconscious.

This made it clear that I couldn’t trust Ian in this game.

Moreover, Luce appeared to be on the verge of summoning Thunderbird –
Galia.

If I was even a little later, I would have been in big trouble…

“That’s a relief…” **(Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr)**

I breathed a sigh of relief.

When I spoke, I heard a gurgling sound that sounded like the cry of an
animal. It seemed like when I talked, a berserker’s cry came out of my
mouth.

***…I’m about to be misunderstood as a demon, too.***

Anyway, I succeeded in getting here in time.

What I had to do now was clear.

***Power… overwhelming!^1^T/N: This is Issac referencing a Starcraft
cheat which makes the player invincible. ‘Power Overwhelming’ = ‘힘이
넘쳐흐른다’***

My body didn’t even feel like my own. It was so light!

It felt as though there would be a burst of wind if I even slightly
swung my fist.

An uncontrollable amount of mana was overflowing inside me.

I felt like I could easily get rid of that demon.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

An icy chill surged through my entire body, enveloping me in cold air,
and enhanced my ice magic output.

It was a level of mastery that the ordinary Isaac could never even hope
to achieve, but with the current me, it was possible.

*\[Hmm!!\]*

The demon, \[Pernicus the Contemplative\], exuded a strong sense of
vigilance as he poured out his magic and created a black \[Ice Spear\]
in the air.

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Ice Spear (Ice Element)」

A huge \[Ice Spear\] menacingly ripped through the air and targeted me.

Despite its incredible speed, avoiding it was child’s play.

The \[Ice Spear\] had a limited attack range. Its main purpose was to be
hurled at enemies to pierce them with its tip, which was best used for
huge magic beasts.

However, Pernicus used \[Ice Spear\] against humans.

If I avoided the \[Ice Spear\], he would use a tactic that involved
blowing up the darkness mana that he already infused his \[Ice Spear\]
with in advance, which would blast ice shards in every direction.

It was an incredibly difficult attack pattern to avoid.

***But, the current me?***

***‘I’m a Demon-Limited Hunter.’***

I could just parry that \[Ice Spear\].

I spread my palms and poured out my mana generously. Because my skill
tree increased to +10, I was able to use magic that I couldn’t normally
use.

I swung my arm, and then.

*──Tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuh—!*

Following the movement of my hand, a massive \[Ice Wall\] spread out.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Kaang—!!*

The \[Ice Spear\] couldn’t pierce through the solid \[Ice Wall\].

After hearing the two spells collide, I immediately jumped off the
cliff.

*Woooooosh!*

“Whoa!” **(Guwaak!)**

My body leaped like a ball, and I felt like I was floating in the air
for a while.

***It’s exciting…! This dizzying feeling is as if I were bungee
jumping…!***

As adrenaline and dopamine rushed through my body, the feeling of
excitement surged.

I dispelled the \[Ice Wall\], causing the gigantic wall of ice to
instantly disintegrate into a powder that scattered into blue light. The
sight of the blue light engulfing my surroundings was spectacular.

In the midst of that light, I went flying toward Pernicus.

*\[Hmm?!!\]*

Just from his expression alone, one could see how flustered Pernicus
was.

He hastily attempted to use his magic, but it was too late.

As I soared towards him, I poured ice mana into my right hand.

A blue magic circle appeared in front of my palm, and mana condensed as
I reached out my hand in Pernicus’ direction.

When I finally reached the enemy, the mana fully condensed before
erupting into a magnificent explosion.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element), ★5」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah*────!!

Ice exploded in all directions, releasing an onslaught of ice upon the
demon.

A misty cold air was rampant as the explosive flood of ice engulfed
Pernicus.

The enormous block of ice created by the \[Ice Explosion\] initially
appeared to cover the Delphine Forest before rising off the ground and
extending diagonally toward the sky.

I landed softly on the ground and rose.

“Whew.” **(Greung…)**

My sigh became a cold chill that permeated the air.

I lowered my hand and turned to face Pernicus, who was trapped in the
ice block, seemingly in pain.

Slowly, I clenched my right hand.

*Crack*—!

*Kwajajak*-!

Then, the huge block of ice shattered and dissipated into a beautiful
blue powder, before scattering into shards as Pernicus fell to the
floor, coughing up blood…

*\[Huuu… uuum…\]*

…With the expression of a failed philosopher who couldn’t find the
answer he desperately sought, no matter how much he repeated his
thoughts.

Pernicus turned to ashes and scattered away in the wind.

“…”

It was over.

I succeeded in preventing a bad ending.

I felt such a strong wave of relief that made my entire body shiver.

***I’m glad…***

All of a sudden, a system window appeared before my eyes.

\[Congratulations! You have defeated the demon \[Pernicus the
Contemplative (Lv 105)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has
increased to 30!\] \[You have gained an additional 8 bonus stat
points!\]

This time, there wasn’t any special achievement, but there was one other
thing that more than made up for it.

A black, finger-sized, spherical jewel had fallen where Pernicus turned
to ash and vanished. It was the reward for defeating Pernicus.

I picked it up and put it in my pocket.

\[You have obtained the loot \[Remnant of Darkness\]!\] \[Remnant of
Darkness\] It imbues the user’s basic elemental magic with dark mana,
granting the ability to learn a new elemental magic.

Rank: Tier 1

***The Remnant of Darkness is mine now.***

***The main character?***

\[Ian Fairytale\] **Lv:** 38

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Light, Fire

**Danger:** X

***Why would such a pathetic bastard need something like this?***

Anyways, his level increased significantly since the last time I saw him
at the entrance ceremony. At the time, he was only level 32… Being the
main character, his growth rate was ridiculously fast.

He chose fire as an element other than light. I was glad we had no
overlap… No wait, if my second element was fire, there would be an
overlap. I could only hope that my second element wasn’t fire.

After obtaining Hilde’s Frostscythe, I would need to acquire the final
weapon of the second element that I would acquire later, so it was
better if it didn’t overlap with Ian.

***…Ah, now my body is getting heavy. It seems that I returned to my
normal state.***

It was as if I had been wearing sandbags all my life, and then took them
off for a moment of freedom before ultimately putting them on again.

It seemed my skills had returned to normal…

No, my total mana increased by 10 points, and \[Elemental Firepower\]
increased from D to D+.

Apparently, my stats had improved while dealing with Tristan Humphrey
and \[Pernicus the Contemplative\].

It was a small increase, but it still felt great.

“…What are you?”

“Huh?” **(Greung?)**

I forgot Luce was here too…

She was glaring at me with a wary face.

“Are you a monster?”

I was sure I looked like a dangerous monster right now, but she still
calmly asked about my identity.

No matter what answer I gave, she would only hear ‘Greung’ or ‘Guwaak’.

It was in my best interest to quickly run away. Now that the big event
was over, I needed to collect more mana grains.

I was going to collect as many mana grains as possible, until the end of
this class placement evaluation.

Fortunately, I didn’t have to be concerned about being looked at
suspiciously even though a Grade E student like myself made it through
the lengthy class placement evaluation, since it was a secret who
survived and how they survived.

Unless someone like Tristan bragged about it.

Luckily, he had a lot of pride, so he wouldn’t go around bragging about
how he got beat up by me.

I turned my back on Luce and started running away.

“Wait a minute!”

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1 )」

“Whoa!” **(Guwaak!)**

*Splashh*-!

*Tuk*─

A column of water shot up at my feet. I was startled and stumbled
backwards.

It was Luce’s magic. I never thought that she would try to bind my feet…

“Name… What is your name?”

“…”

***Why are you asking a grunting monster for his name?***

“Greung.” (Greung.)

It was going to sound like ‘Greung’ or ‘Guwaak’ anyway, so I just
answered with a cry.

Then I started moving my feet again. Fortunately, Luce didn’t try to
stop me anymore.

“…Greung.”

For some reason, Luce kept repeating the sound of my cry to herself.

I ignored it and continued to run through the darkness of the forest. I
had to get out of here and search for mana grains.

After running quite a distance from Luce, I removed my Cloak of
Disguise.

Now, if I put this Cloak of Disguise into the magic pouch, it was like
destroying the evidence.

***Every time I see this large piece of clothing fit into a small
pocket, I get amazed. They say it’s a storage spell, but I don’t know
the principle behind it. Anyways, the magic pouch is a really convenient
item…***

***…where did it go?***

‘Where did the magic pouch go?’

It wasn’t there. No matter where I looked, there was no magic pouch…

I looked back at my memories, I was sure… Before I ran away from Luce, I
heard a ‘Tuk’ sound when she used her \[Water Generation\] spell…

Was it then…!?

‘Ah, I have to go back.’

Darkness filled the sky, and the place where I briefly stopped because
of Luce’s magic was also very dark. That was why I probably didn’t
notice the magic pouch falling…

***How do I go back and pick it up?***

***Is Luce still there? If she is, would it be better to go back in
while disguised and pick up the pouch?***

No, it would be unnatural for a monster that had fled after defeating a
demon to suddenly return and retrieve something. Luce would undoubtedly
find it strange.

Besides, I wondered if she would let me go. It was over the moment she
caught me. There was no way I could resist her interrogation. It would
only be a matter of time before she realized that the clothes I was
wearing were a Magic Cloak of Disguise.

If that was the case, it was a bit of a risky gamble…

I had no choice but to go as Isaac and pick it up naturally. Falling
down pretending to be surprised, sneaking back, secretly picking up the
magic pouch, and running away.

According to my memory, Luce didn’t touch Ian. This was because she had
already accumulated enough points, and her head was filled with thoughts
about the demon.

Besides, she was a person who had no interest in other people. She
didn’t even know who the student with Grade E mana was, and didn’t even
try to find out until the story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was over.

She wouldn’t have any doubts about the fact that I, a Grade E, was still
alive.

In other words, it was worth betting that she didn’t care about
weaklings like me.

I hid the Cloak of Disguise in a pile of grass and headed back to the
place where I had fought Pernicus.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

Luce required some time to collect her thoughts.

The monster that just left was strong enough to crush the demon, who
Luce struggled against, with one strike. Common sense told her she
shouldn’t be caught or chased by a monster that strong.

If the madness and hostility he exuded had been directed at her, it
would have led to irreversible and disastrous consequences.

Yet, Luce mustered the courage to stop the monster just once. It was
because she wanted to ask for its name.

For a moment, she regretted doing such a foolish thing. Anxiety swept
over her at the thought of fighting the monster.

But the monster quietly left. It was a relief.

“Greung…”

Luce recalled his answer.

Greung. It was called Greung.

Of course, she knew it was just a cry. However, not knowing what to
properly call it, she decided to call it ‘Greung’.

‘What is its true identity…?’

Luce posed a question. It was still impossible to know at this point.

She then heard the rustling of grass. It came from the direction that
the monster had left in.

Could it be that ‘Greung’ had returned? Luce took a quick look at the
direction of the noise.

“Crap!”

…It wasn’t. It was an ordinary male student.

A man with red eyes and silver hair tinged with a bluish glow under the
moonlight.

As soon as he saw Luce, he fell down on his butt in surprise.

Luce couldn’t hide her disappointment.

She had already earned enough points because no one could match her.

That man was surely nobody important.

Besides, her head was full of thoughts about the demon and Greung. She
didn’t have time to worry about a frail-looking guy.

“To- top…!”

***It’s noisy, don’t make a fuss and just go.***

Luce frowned.

Did he notice her frowning expression? The student with blue-silver hair
crept back with a terrified face as if he had seen a ghost.

Then, he quickly got up and started running.

“…”

Luce looked at Ian, who was still unconscious.

He looked like he would be fine, so she walked away, leaving Ian
unattended.

Chapter 10: - Class Placement Evaluation Interlude
==================================================

༺ **Class Placement Evaluation Interlude**༻

The class placement evaluation was over.

However, the results were less than desirable.

I survived for 5 hours while being the weakest and managed to defeat the
demon, but despite all that I only collected 2 mana grains.

Since each mana grain was worth 10 points, I ended the exam with a total
of 20 points.

Regardless of the loophole that the mana grains could be seen better at
night, the students here had excellent mana perception. As such, they
collected most if not all of the mana grains.

Besides, there wasn’t enough time.

Right after defeating \[Pernicus the Contemplative\], there were barely
even 20 minutes remaining.

In addition to that, I returned to the scene where I had defeated the
demon, pretended to be surprised in front of Luce with acting comparable
to that of famous actors, secretly picked up the magic pouch, and
returned with only about 10 minutes left.

I had only ten minutes to search for the remaining mana grains…

Gel was earned according to the class placement evaluation points. In
other words, I would only earn 20 gels.

If I bought two loaves of bread, I would run out of gels…

‘I’m at a loss.’

When I returned to my dormitory, I stretched out in frustration… and got
up again, then went out to exercise.

It wasn’t the time to struggle. It wasn’t the time to get frustrated
because I earned less gels. I had to be strong. Strong enough to defeat
the final boss, the Evil God Nephid.

‘Ugh.’

My entire body ached, as expected. Muscle pain was no laughing matter.
It seemed almost unreasonable how bad it truly was.

When I went to the gym for a few days, the students from the Knight
Department greeted me and gave me a series of hellish PTs. On top of
that, I was already tired from the class placement evaluation.

Still, I couldn’t put off training. Today, I had to focus on magic
training, since I wanted to relive the magic perception I had used when
dealing with \[Pernicus the Contemplative\] as soon as possible.

Since the class placement evaluation was held today, most of the first
years would either be resting or completely exhausted. Meaning, I could
monopolize the training grounds.

A full moon was hanging in the night sky.

I ignored the corner of the garden where I had been practicing magic for
a week, and went to the training ground for the Magic Department’s first
years.

As I entered the domed building, a view of the empty training ground
greeted me. The ceiling lit up with luminescent magic as I turned on the
light.

The silence was awkward for me, since this was always a place where
high-spirited students trained their magic while sweating profusely. I
was ignored because I was a commoner with Grade E mana, so I couldn’t
use the training ground to my heart’s content. If I got caught in a bad
fight, I would suffer both mentally and physically.

So, except for the first day of measuring mana, today was the first time
I had ever used the training ground.

*Spacious.* Special facilities comprising various elements were
installed. Lakes, fireplaces, rocks, icebergs, and so forth… The area
where those facilities were installed served as a training ground for
\[Elemental Efficiency\] and \[Elemental Synergy\].

There was also a training area where I could hit targets with different
elements, and just next door, I could fight illusions of monsters.

“Let’s do it…”

I slapped my cheeks to drive away the fatigue.

***It’s not time to rest yet, hang in there.***

***Let’s start by distributing my stat points.***

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 8 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (C): 26/100 \[UP\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (C): 27/100 \[UP\]

– Learning Efficiency (D): 12/100 \[UP\] ◈ Elemental Resistance – Fire
Resistance (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– Water Resistance (D): 6/100 \[UP\]

– Ice Resistance (C-): 24/100 \[UP\]

– Lightning Resistance (C): 29/100 \[UP\]

– Rock Resistance (E): 2/100 \[UP\]

– Wind Resistance (D): 13/100 \[UP\]

– Neutral Magic Resistance (D): 8/100 \[UP\] ◈ vs. Race Combat Power –
vs. Human Combat Power (E): 4/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Other Races Combat Power (E): 1/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Demon Combat Power (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

I invested all 8 stats points into \[Magic Training Efficiency\].

\[Potential \[Magic Training Efficiency\] has increased from C to C+!\]

C+ Grade… Certainly, my growth rate would rise, but I remembered that
the noticeable change occurred from the B+ Grade.

B+ Grade was the area of genius.

As I waved my hand, the status window disappeared.

*Now, let’s review the magic I used against Pernicus.*

First and foremost, I wanted to learn the 5-star magic \[Frost
Explosion\] as quickly as possible.

\[Frost Explosion\] was an extremely versatile and powerful offensive
magic. It would become a kind of ultimate skill for me once I got used
to it.

However, in the game, 5-star magic can only be mastered by the second
year. Students like Luce and Kaya, who could easily use 5-star magic
since the first year, were exceptionally talented.

Anyways, my short-term goal was to master \[Frost Explosion\] to an
amateur level at least, before the PvP performance evaluation.

It would be a good opportunity to evaluate my fighting ability as
ordinary Isaac. The enemies I would fight in the future wouldn’t be
limited to demons, which meant I couldn’t solely rely on my unique trait
\[Hunter\].

It was even the end-of-semester evaluation, not long after the PvP
performance evaluation. Since there was a part where Luce’s familiar,
the level 175 ‘Thunderbird Galia’ appeared, I would easily die if things
went wrong.

Therefore, it was necessary to increase the number of skills available
when the \[Hunter\] trait was triggered.

‘But who am I going to fight against in the PvP match?’

During the PvP performance evaluation, the main character, Ian
Fairytale, was paired up with Luce. Now, were the matched opponents
decided on luck? Of course they weren’t. Ian was just being a brat.

Then what about me? Isaac’s bout wasn’t depicted in the game, meaning
this was uncharted territory.

At least until then, I wanted to learn a few decent skills besides
\[Frost Explosion\].

I stood upright and pressed the fingers of both hands together, creating
a gap between my palms and channeling my mana flow through it at maximum
output.

Because \[Frost Explosion\] was a spell that poured mana all at once and
explodes, this was the most efficient stance.

In the space between my palms, the cold blue ice mana started
condensing.

***Release it all at once and explode!***

I extended my hand and released a burst of the condensed blue mana.

*…Paaaaat─*

“Ah.”

The mana scattered helplessly. It sounded like a deflated balloon.

When dealing with demons, I could easily use \[Frost Explosion\] due to
the influence of ‘Skill Tree +10’, but now, even trying it didn’t work
properly.

“Who0…”

***One more time.***

*…Paaaaat─*

***…Eh.***

Beads of sweat dripped down from the attempt itself. It was difficult to
finely control the mana, especially since the amount I had was
insufficient to begin with.

If it felt like I was pouring out mana against the demon, it now felt
like I’m spilling mana.

***When you take a shower, the water pressure is weak, and there is only
one hole to pour out the water, so it ends up feeling small.***

I opened my status window. I wanted to check the acquisition conditions
of \[Frost Explosion\] once again.

*Pat─*

I clicked \[Skill Tree ❰❰Details❱❱\] at the bottom.

I pressed the first of the two elements, the \[Ice\] element. The second
element had not yet been opened, so the second skill tree was still
locked.

By the way, there was also a third menu, \[Neutral\], which included
things like \[Basic Protection Magic\].

I checked the ice skills displayed in the \[Ice\] section. The skills I
could use were etched in bright letters. \[Ice Generation\], \[Ice
Curtain\], and \[Cold Divergence\].

In the middle of a skill tree with circuit-like branches extending
downwards, the words \[Frost Explosion\] were engraved. Unlike the
bright letters of other skills, the color of \[Frost Explosion\] was
dark, meaning it was a skill I had yet to master.

When I pressed \[Frost Explosion\] with my finger, a new system window
appeared.

\[Frost Explosion (★5)\] Condenses and releases a large amount of ice
mana, causing explosive freezing and dealing powerful damage to enemies.

Trigger Conditions:

– None

I hadn’t met any of the conditions.

As expected, ultimate skills aren’t always easy to obtain.

I waved my hand and the status window disappeared.

There was still time, so I had no choice but to train harder and become
stronger.

‘\[Ice Generation\]’.

I released my mana toward the large rock prepared in the training
ground.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

*Cracking—*

If I used \[Ice Generation\] raw, I could only create ice the size of a
soccer ball.

But if I used it on something like a rock, it was possible to freeze it
by expanding it.

The surface of the rock was completely covered by the ice that I had
created. But as expected, it was thin.

“Oh right.”

Now that I thought of it, there was loot.

I took out the ‘Remnant of Darkness’ I had put in my pocket.

I infused the Remnant of Darkness, which looked like black pearls, with
ice mana.

Suddenly, the Remnant of Darkness began to radiate a black light, which
condensed into dark mana and flowed in my body.

It felt as if cold and dreary mana were merging in my body. Suddenly, a
new sensation arose, and a system window appeared in the air.

\[The aura of the loot \[Remnant of Darkness\] permeates you…\]
\[Congratulations! You have learned the unique skill \[Black Ice\]!\]
\[Black Ice (★5)\] Creates black ice.

**Type:** Active Skill (All-Purpose)

**Elements:** Ice (Derived from Darkness)

– Apply ice mana to \[Remnant of Darkness\] (O) **Trigger Conditions:**

– None

Black Ice.

It was the same skill as \[Ice Generation\], but the firepower and
strength were on a whole other level.

I felt like I knew how to use the black ice as if it was natural, the
sensation instinctual, just like breathing.

I reached for the rock and dispelled the ice. The ice then turned into a
blue powder before scattering into nothingness, and the rock regained
its original form.

After that, I activated the new skill created by mixing ice mana and
dark mana.

‘Black Ice.’

「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Crackling-!*

“Oooh…!”

The rock was instantly covered with black ice.

It was much tougher than the \[Ice Generation\] that I just used, and
the momentum of freezing things was much faster. The black ice covering
the rock’s surface appeared to be five times thicker than when \[Ice
Generation\] was used.

In addition, the ice was glowing black, making it difficult to tell if
there even was a rock inside.

‘I can use it to block my opponent’s vision.’

I then extended my hand upward and activated \[Black Ice\] with maximum
output toward the ceiling.

*Tssarrr!*

“Uh-oh…!”

A large amount of mana disappeared in an instant, leaving my body with
little to no strength. I felt like I would collapse at any moment from
the depletion of mana. But when I saw the ice in the air, I couldn’t
help but be filled with joy.

‘So big!’

It wasn’t the size of a soccer ball, it was nearly the size of a car!

At that moment, a system window appeared in front of my eyes.

\[The \[Elemental Firepower\] of the Ice Element has increased from D+
to C-!\] \[The \[Elemental Efficiency\] of the Ice Element has increased
from D+ to C-!\]

It must have been because my \[Magic Training Efficiency\] increased,
and I had used \[Black Ice\] for the first time. Immediately,
\[Elemental Firepower\] and \[Elemental Efficiency\] went up by one
level.

***Good, good.***

‘Ah, disperse, disperse.’

I quickly dispelled \[Black Ice\] before dropping the black ice block.

The block of black ice turned into a glowing black powder and flew into
the air before disappearing.

‘I almost collapsed for a while… How much mana do I have left?’

**Mana:** 10/350

– Mana Recovery Speed (D)

“Oh my god.”

As soon as I turned on the status window, I felt chills. I couldn’t
believe I only had 10 mana left…

When mana was depleted, the mana recovery rate dropped drastically. Of
course, I hadn’t experienced it yet, but if it was anything like the
game, I needed to avoid it at all costs.

‘\[Black Ice\]… it’s worth the performance.’

Of course, \[Black Ice\] could not completely replace \[Ice
Generation\], because the mana consumption was equally as high as the
superior firepower and strength.

\[Owned Skills\] **Active**

– (★1) Ice Generation (D+) / (★5) Black Ice (D+)

\[Black Ice\]’s level directly corresponded to \[Ice Generation\], so if
the level of one went up, the other would go up as well. This meant that
there would be no loss in terms of growth, even if they were used
alternately.

When the proficiency of \[Black Ice\] reached S rank, it becomes
possible to apply \[Black Ice\] to other magic, like Pernicus did with
\[Ice Spear\]. It was a buff of sorts.

In other words, if the \[Hunter\] trait was activated every time I dealt
with a demon in the future, I could infuse \[Black Ice\] on other spells
to strengthen them. Normally, I would only be able to use it for \[Ice
Generation\].

The issue was that using \[Black Ice\] on other spells would increase my
mana consumption by three times. As a result, it was best to refrain
from doing so unless it was time to go all out.

I had to check one last thing.

‘Have I not learned \[Ice Wall\] yet?’

\[Ice Wall\] was the first magic I had used against Pernicus, and the
sensation of using it was still vividly in my mind.

I went into the status window \[Skill Tree ❰❰Details❱❱\] again, clicked
the \[Ice\] item, and tapped the \[Ice Wall\] skill.

\[Ice Wall (★4)\] Creates a solid wall of ice.

**Type:** Active Skill (Defensive)

**Elements:** Ice

**Acquisition Conditions:**

– Lv 30 (O)

– \[Ice Generation\] Grade C- (-)

– \[Cold Divergence\] Grade C (O)

– Ice Element \[Elemental Firepower\] Grade C- (O)

– Ice Element \[Elemental Efficiency\] Grade C- (O)

‘I’ll learn it soon enough.’

The only unfulfilled acquisition condition, \[Ice Generation\] Grade C-,
was only one step away.

Sooner or later, I would be able to learn \[Ice Wall\].

I felt motivated. After all, it was fun to grow stronger.

First order of business though, was to finish this magic training, since
I was currently lacking mana.

‘I feel good, maybe I should exercise.’

I went to the gym.

Then, the students of the Knight Department greeted me as if they had
been waiting.

After finishing the Hellish PT, I trudged back to the dormitory with
deep regret.

“20 points? Is he even human…?”

‘Orphin Hall’, the Magic Department building.

The first-year students from the Magic Department were gathered in the
hall on the first floor of the building. Meanwhile, a large piece of
parchment, imprinted with the results of the class placement evaluation,
hung on the hall’s central wall.

‘Last place…?’

I was ranked 300th out of 300 students in the first year of the Magic
Department.

***I expected it… But, seeing it is another matter. I really am in last
place.***

On the other hand, Ian, who also had Grade E magic power, was ranked
240th. My insignificance stood out even more.

The students laughed as they looked at me.

***Haah… Nothing in this world is going my way.***

The class placement evaluation was essentially a test to determine which
class each student would be assigned to. As the name implied, the
provisional class was only temporary.

Of course, I would be assigned to the worst class, Class D.

For reference, the class placement evaluation reflected not only the
results of the class placement evaluation, but also the results of the
mana evaluation. In other words, Ian Fairytale, who had Grade E mana,
would also be assigned to the same *Class D* as me.

Even when I played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the result of the class
placement evaluation was unconditionally evaluated as Class D. In the
end, it was an inevitable fate for Ian.

Class D itself was no problem.

***No matter which class I’m in, I’m going to do my best to become
stronger.***

The problem was… Money.

’20 points, so 20 gels…’

I would be given 20 gels – the price of two 10 gel loaves of bread.

***How am I supposed to live on nothing but two loaves of bread?***

“··· The only answer is a loan.”

***I’m afraid I can’t avoid being a debtor.***

A student’s information was shared between the Academy and the bank,
since the island’s banks themselves were under the Academy’s control.

If the loan became a non-performing loan, their credit rating would
fall, and the student’s performance evaluation will be penalized as a
result.

It meant that if you lack the ability, you should leave the academy, or
die trying.

It was a ruthless system befitting the elitist and predatory education
policy of Märchen Academy.

‘Why me…?’

I let out a deep sigh.

Shortly after the class placement evaluation, Luce reported to the
Academy regarding the appearance of the demon.

The faculty called an emergency meeting. Judging from what happened in
the game, I knew the gist of what they talked about.

Firstly, when a demon appeared, it was kept secret to prevent confusion
among the students.

Because there were no signs of an outside invasion, it was concluded
that the demon had been present in the Delphine Forest from the
beginning.

As a result, the academy staff would thoroughly investigate the academy
grounds and devise alternatives for identifying and eliminating risk
factors.

Of course, the Academy’s alternatives would have little to no impact.

Even if they inspect every corner of the exam hall just before the exam
and put up a barrier, that wouldn’t prevent the demons that were
sleeping under the ground in the form of mana from emerging during the
test.

They couldn’t stop it.

In the end, the director and the principal would have to shoulder a
heavy burden, but the academy would continue to run, so there was no
need to worry.

However, this time there was something different from the original
game’s story.

‘I intervened.’

***It’s my existence as Isaac.***

Luce seemed to have also reported about the monster that had defeated
the demon, which was just me in disguise.

I could tell by looking at the notice posted on the bulletin board in
Academy Square.

The notice depicted a humanoid monster with ragged muscles, and it read:
*‘Students who have seen a figure with this appearance, please report
it.’*

‘This is what it looks like…’

In the game, when you wore a Cloak of Disguise, your character changed
as if you were wearing a skin. So I knew how scary the Berserker looked.

More than 2m in height, with bulging muscles. That huge guy had the face
of a ferocious monster with black skin and a large gaping mouth.

The sharp but well-arranged teeth were clearly visible.

Plus, the fangs were as big as those of a saber-tooth tiger, and with
its haggard hood pressed down, the corners of his eyes appeared to be
dark, which only served to emphasize its ferocious eyes that radiated an
ominous red glow.

All these traits combined to form an appearance that could only be
described as menacing.

‘I’m about to be misunderstood for a demon.’

The demons would continue to appear until Ian graduated, and I would
continue to hunt them down.

If the academy staff, who would be in trouble because of the demons, got
to know me like that, I don’t know what kind of trouble would arise.

It was only a matter of time before my existence reached the ears of
student council president Alice Carroll.

The same went for being talked about by students. Just imagining it made
my head hurt.

It would be best to reach the final boss, the Evil God Nephid, while
reducing as many variables as possible.

That’s why I bought a Magic Cloak of Disguise, but of course, it turned
out to be a Berserker skin…

*If I catch a demon and get misunderstood and attacked because of my
appearance, it would be a disaster.*

Still, I couldn’t help it.

Firstly, I didn’t know how to recognize the concept of that outfit. The
only thing in stock was that one outfit, and the shopkeeper didn’t
explain anything.

‘But I can’t buy anything else anymore…’

One of the secret shop’s features was that it didn’t offer refunds or
exchanges. And to add insult to injury, the price range was too high to
buy another Cloak of Disguise.

Currently, I was in a position where all of my assets would be gone if I
just bought and ate two loaves of bread.

In the first place, it was doubtful that other stocks would have come in
time.

“I am hungry…”

The growling sound from my stomach brought me to tears. ***Hungry…***

But all I had was a 10 gel loaf of bread in my hand.

I sat on a bench in broad daylight and began to eat.

Now, my only remaining wealth was 10 gels. I would have to go to the
bank later and get a loan…

***I’m a freshman who has just taken the class placement assessment, and
I’m already in debt.***

I have played the game countless times, and nothing like this has ever
happened…

***It’s painful, really.***

“Are you alone?”

Suddenly, a deep male voice called out from behind.

It was an all-too-familiar voice that I heard a lot while playing ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

I turned around to see the owner of the voice.

\[Mateo Jordana\] **Lv:** 75

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

His brown hair was parted into bangs, leaving his forehead exposed, and
his facial features were defined. He had a sturdy physique, so he fit
the image of a rock element.

Mateo Jordana.

He was a named character who would eventually face Ian Fairytale and
play an important supporting role in the future.

As I stared blankly at him, Mateo introduced himself.

“It’s Mateo Jordana. You’re Isaac, right?”

Mateo asked while leaning slightly on the bench.

His voice echoed as if it were in a cave. I wish my voice was
overflowing with masculinity like that.

“Right, why do you ask?”

“Only one loaf of bread… Are you not eating a proper meal?”

“That’s because I don’t have any gel.”

“You’ve already used up the gel? No, no way… Were you robbed?”

Mateo furrowed his eyebrows.

It was a response that reassured me that we were on the same side, it
was only natural considering he was a commoner. He must have felt a
sense of kinship with me, another commoner.

Mateo’s gang, which would be formed later, were all commoners. Mateo was
going to rebel against the nobles, and Ian was the first to come into
conflict.

***In order to prevent a bad ending, Isaac, me, needs to be this guy’s
subordinate for a while.***

“Well… That’s right.”

I lied on purpose to garner his sympathy so he would buy me food.

Mateo had a strong sense of camaraderie, so he couldn’t easily ignore a
pitiful guy like me. And now, that camaraderie was directed toward
‘commoners.’

Besides, he had become accustomed to saving money, and his magic skills
were also top-notch. No matter what, he would always have a few extra
gels.

“Damn it, the nobles did it again…! Follow me right now. I’ll help
balance your nutrition.”

I didn’t say whether the robbery was the work of a nobleman or a
commoner, but Mateo seemed to make his own assumption.

It would be great if I could just get some food. Due to his personality,
it seemed I wouldn’t have to starve for the time being.

***Sweet. I didn’t expect that to work.***

Of course, I planned to pay off my debt all at once when the time came.

I went to the student cafeteria with Mateo and ate a 50 gel meal. He
asked who the robber was, and I evasively replied that I didn’t know
because it was late at night.

“The classes were determined by combining the results of mana evaluation
and the class placement evaluation. This is the lowest among all the
classes, Class D.”

In a classroom with 20 people, I was sitting in the middle.

Five students were assigned to the top class, Class A, and twenty
students to the worst class, Class D. The rest of the students were
clustered into Class B and Class C.

In other words, the place I was in was the classroom for students in
Class D.

“Meaning, all of you are the most incompetent freshmen students
currently in the Magic Department.”

In front of the podium, the professor in charge of Class D glanced over
the students with blue eyes as he recited his orientation in an
apathetic tone.

It was Professor Fernando, a handsome-looking man with silver hair.

I could see the fluttering figures of the Class D girls. It was to the
point where I could start hearing jokes about *how fortunate it was for
them to be in Class D.*

*…****Who could possibly be making such sarcastic remarks so happily?***

“This is Märchen Academy. In this world, only the strong survive.”

Professor Fernando continued to speak as he slowly paced back and forth
with his hands behind his back. The sound of his shoes echoed throughout
the classroom.

“The educational opportunities may be equal, but there is no
consideration for the weak in results. If you don’t become strong, you
will only be eaten by the guys from the top class. So survive, failure
to do so will result in expulsion.”

If you failed to meet the standard, you would be given a strike. Once
you accumulated 3 strikes, you would be expelled.

***Come to think of it, maybe the reason that Isaac didn’t appear after
the beginning of the game was because he was expelled…?***

***…I’ll have to work harder.***

“Even if you are in Class D, you are supposed to be the elite of the
elite, just like the other students of Märchen Academy. Develop
thoroughly and try as hard as you can. This is your duty as both wizards
and students of Märchen Academy. If you do all that, you will graduate
with your diploma. Do you understand?”

Professor Fernando stopped and asked the students in an ice-cold voice.

The female students gave a lively, “Yes!”

Professor Fernando was taken aback by the unexpected mood of the
students.

I had been through this brief orientation so many times to the point of
getting tired of it. I practically had the entire thing memorized. I was
even capable of imitating the professor’s voice.

“Hmm. Then, let me explain the curriculum for Class D going forward.”

In the game, the cutscene ended here and the scene changed, and the
phrase 「Act 2, Chapter 1, Class D」 appeared. It meant that the second
act of the story had begun.

Despite that, Professor Fernando’s orientation continued. It was a scene
outside of the game.

By the way, the episode about catching Trevion the Evil was 「Act 1,
Chapter 1, Ian Fairytale」.

The mana evaluation episode was 「Act 1, Chapter 2, Passion of a Grade
E」.

The class placement evaluation episode was 「Act 1, Chapter 3, Class
Placement Evaluation」.

“…During the first semester, you will intensively master one element.
The first semester curriculum is also structured accordingly. If you can
properly master one element, you will be able to become a proficient
wizard.”

In line with the academy curriculum, it would be more efficient to
intensively master ice magic during the first semester.

The second element could be learned in the second semester of the first
year.

Afterward, Professor Fernando explained the schedule ahead. It was
filled with stuff I already knew.

It had nothing to do with the curriculum, but soon, 「Act 2, Chapter 2,
Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case」 would begin. This was the episode
where Ian and Mateo got involved, as well as the event where I could get
the loot called the ‘Abyssal Ring’, which gave the wearer the ability to
read minds.

Then there was the 「Act 2, Chapter 3, Practical Training」 episode.

During the practical training, the infamous 「Act 2, Chapter 4, Ant
Legion」 episode would begin once ‘Garzia the Hermit’, commonly known as
‘The Little Ant’ emerged.

One of the Wailing Walls of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ in Hell
Difficulty. He was a demon who was hated by many players.

His pattern was very tricky, and his level was 140. Even if I used the
\[Hunter\] trait, it would be difficult to defeat him.

In addition, Garzia’s servants, the ‘Disaster Ant’ legion, had excellent
collective intelligence and used all kinds of tactics to pressure the
player.

Now, why would the already hell mode suddenly spike in difficulty? The
reason was Garzia’s setting.

There was a countermeasure for Garzia that I had thought of beforehand.
I just hoped it would go well.

As much as Garzia was called a Wailing Wall, there was a very useful
item called the ‘Sheath of Disaster’ he would drop despite being hated.

‘That has to be mine, no matter what.’

Next was the 「Act 3, Chapter 1, Battle」 episode.

At this time, a PvP performance evaluation would be scheduled. It was
sparring, which would be a way for the freshmen to fight one on one
against each other.

The key point of this episode was the scene where Ian fought Luce and
surprised the students by using his light magic.

‘Who am I fighting with?’

By then, I would be a little stronger. It would be a good measure to
assess how strong I had become.

Let’s just avoid insurmountable walls like Kaya, since it was obvious
that I would just be overpowered.

Next was the 「Act 3, Chapter 2, Familiar」. That was when I could get a
familiar, and the episode that concluded the long-awaited first
semester, 「Act 3, Chapter 3, Semester Exam」. This lead to 「Act 3,
Chapter 4, Thunderbird Subjugation」.

Once I finished ‘Act 3, Chapter 4,’ the first semester would be over,
and we would be given time off. In order to grow stronger, I would have
to plan my vacation very specifically. Before that, though, I had to
survive the Thunderbird.

***Let’s keep thinking. I need to recall each episode in as much detail
as I can, and use all the advantages I can get.***

And.

‘I have to defeat the Evil God Nephid and clear this game.’

༛༛ ༛ ༛༺༻༛ ༛ ༛༛

Luce couldn’t concentrate on the class.

Just as she had expected, she was assigned to Class A, and one student
was already trying to build connections.

“Luce Eltania, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m from the Whiteclark
family…”

*Swish–*

Once Luce arrived in the classroom, she ignored the students who were
trying to make her acquaintance by keeping a cold demeanor.

She didn’t care much about others in the first place. Her main concerns
were neither connections nor a youthful life.

She entered this academy with her eyes on ‘Märchen Academy’s Senior
Diploma of the Magic Department.’

Then, her goal of becoming a Tower Master would be much easier.

“…”

However…

Like a small fishbone stuck in her throat, there was something that kept
bothering her.

She couldn’t hear the contents of Professor Philip’s class, who was in
charge of Class A. It didn’t matter, though, because it felt like she
was reviewing stuff that she already knew.

‘The Demon, and Greung…’

After Luce reported what had happened during the class placement
evaluation to the academy, she was told that ‘there was no outside
invasion.’

In other words, Greung and the demon were in Delphine Forest from the
very beginning.

‘At that time, there were only first-year students in Delphine Forest.
Is it possible that either the demon or Greung was a student in the
Magic Department who used a Magic Cloak of Disguise or something… At
least that can’t be the case for the demon.’

The freshmen at the Märchen Academy had to undergo a detailed
verification process to see what elements they had.

Just in case, if an intelligent demon had entered the academy, its
darkness mana would have been discovered. In other words, there was no
way the demon could be an official student.

‘But Greung is different.’

On the other hand, Greung simply showed ‘Ice Magic’, an ordinary
element. It was possible that the monster could be an academy student.

‘It looked like he had come to hunt the demon… Did Greung know in
advance that a demon would appear during the class placement
evaluation?’

Such thoughts plagued her mind.

‘What if Greung is a first-year student in the Magic Department and was
in Delphine Forest during the class placement evaluation? What if he
entered Märchen Academy with the purpose of hunting demons? What if for
some reason he didn’t want to be discovered, so he used a Cloak of
Disguise to hide his identity…?’

…It made sense that an absurd monster was hiding with such a motive.

But Luce immediately shook her head.

‘…That’s stupid. We already finished the mana evaluation on the first
day. If someone was that strong, he would have been caught.’

The results of the mana evaluation did not lie. It was impossible to
hide the maximum amount of mana.

…Unless it was the ‘Realm of an Archwizard’ that Professor Fernando
referred to.

‘No way… it can’t possibly be, right?’

***It’s not. It can’t be.*** It wasn’t possible for a student her age to
have reached the realm of an Archwizard. It wasn’t realistic.

Luce pondered as she stroked her chin with her slightly bent index
finger.

‘Or, maybe Greung is a vagabond, and was wandering through the Delphine
Forest.’

***Let’s think about it, are there any more clues?***

‘…Clothes.’

Clothes. Luce recalled the clothes Greung was wearing.

Her eyes caught the appearance of the clothes that Greung was wearing
when magic manifested and illuminated it in the night forest.

The memory came back to Luce as vividly as a photograph, and she
examined the fragments of her memory.

Not entirely neat, but almost new. They weren’t tattered enough to be
seen as a vagrant.

What if it was ‘Magic Cloak of Disguise’?

Perhaps he anticipated that a situation would arise in which he would be
forced to conceal his identity.

And… the story of him appearing to slay the demon.

…It didn’t make sense, but at least one hypothesis came to mind.

‘Among my classmates, there is a person who has reached the realm of an
Archwizard, and that person secretly entered this academy to hunt
demons… There’s some kind of mystery hidden in this academy…’

Luce let out a small laugh. She thought of it herself, but it was
ridiculous.

‘What nonsense am I thinking of…’

But what if it was real?

‘…It wouldn’t hurt to investigate.’

Luce had always kept her heart closed to others since the age of ten,
after she signed a contract with Thunderbird Galia.

But now, for the first time in a long while, she was seething with
curiosity about someone else.

‘First of all, I’ll have to pay attention to my classmates who use the
ice element.’

Luce wrote that decision with a quill on a parchment that laid beside
her book…

\[Uncovering Greung’s identity\]

…Then, she smoothly underlined the sentence.

Chapter 12: - The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (1)
======================================================

༺ **The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (1)**༻

It was midday, and the sun was shining brightly. A cool breeze gently
caressed my skin.

I was chatting with Mateo under the shade of a tree after hanging out
with him.

Mateo, as expected, invited me to join his gang.

He looked after me for three days, and I accepted the offer while
pretending to be impressed by the fact that he bought me a meal, exuding
the impression of ‘I will follow you’.

I was truly grateful. Thanks to him, I was able to fill my stomach and
focus on training without becoming a debtor.

“A noble title? Give it to the dog. My purpose is to get revenge on the
nobles who ignore the common people. I will become stronger here and
raise the status of commoners.”

Mateo made a promise that I couldn’t care less about. I pretended to be
moved, saying things like ‘hmm, yes,’ and ‘right!’. It was necessary in
order to earn Mateo’s trust.

I felt as if I had become a new employee at the company, trying to
please the manager.

“Someday, I will create a world where commoners are not looked down
upon. You understand it well, since you were treated badly because you
were a Grade E commoner. Take my side, Isaac.”

“…I get it, I’ll jump on board.”

It was a false promise that would be shattered soon.

***I have to stop the bad ending, so I’ll have to play with you for a
while.***

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

Just like that, I became a member of Mateo’s gang.

Besides me, there were three more people in Mateo’s gang. One from Class
B and two from Class C, all were of commoner origin.

“Ugh, do I have to do this…?”

As a member of Mateo’s gang, I had to put my bangs up. I didn’t look
very good with my forehead shown.

Anyways, Mateo, who was holding the school uniform jacket over his
shoulder, led the way, and I and his three subordinates followed.

Mateo was working hard in order to rewrite the dark history.

***Is it because everyone has their bangs up?*** As we walked through
the corridors of Orphin Hall, I could feel the eyes of the students
focusing on us.

“Hey, it’s that Grade E commoner.”

“That Grade E guy joined Mateo’s gang to survive.”

“He was last in the class placement evaluation, pfft.”

…No, they were solely staring and laughing at me.

As expected of Märchen Academy. The students’ terrible personalities
were amazing.

“What did you say to my friend?”

“Ah…! Oh, no, it’s nothing…”

***Oh? Mateo picked a fight in my stead.***

Mateo, who was at the top of Class B, was a recognized talent. Most
students didn’t even dare to approach him.

Märchen Academy had a setting where one’s social status didn’t
necessarily determine their ability to learn. Of course, that didn’t
mean that social status wasn’t important, but rather one’s skill and
abilities held more weight in terms of status.

‘Bastard…’

I snorted.

Even though I was just a subordinate, I couldn’t help but be grateful
for Mateo’s friendship.

Of course, I was only grateful to him for taking my side. The current
Mateo was naive and hopeless, so he wasn’t particularly impressive as a
person.

“Ian Fairytale?”

At that time, another kid beside me called out the main character’s
name.

It was because Ian intervened when Mateo was picking a fight with
another student.

Mateo and Ian’s gazes clashed.

Silence. The air became heavy.

“That bastard, what are you going to say to brother Mateo this time…?”

“Cheeky bastard.”

***Don’t you think it’s too much to call him brother when we’re in the
same class?***

“Are you arguing with someone again, Mateo?”

Wow, it was the first time I’d heard Ian’s voice in this world.

A sharp voice like that of a main character. It was a very familiar
voice that I had heard countless times while playing the game.

I almost said hello because I was so happy to see him.

Mateo stepped closer to Ian and looked down at him in an intimidating
manner.

“Ian Fairytale… the second son of a Viscount… As expected, you are
annoying too.”

“What are you going to do about it?”

“I will use you as a stepping stone for my goal, and as an example of my
hostility toward the aristocracy.”

“You foolish bastard.”

***Okay, they’re fighting, the story is going just as planned.***

According to the story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Ian and Mateo must
have already met before and were on the verge of fighting.

The root of the problem was that Mateo asked a Class C student in the
Magic Department for a one-on-one spar at the training ground. The
opponent was a discriminatory aristocrat who usually despised commoners.
Mateo obliterated him with zeal.

At that time, Ian, the protagonist with a strong sense of justice who
happened to be on the same training ground as Mateo, stepped up and
stopped him and the two engaged in a battle of nerves.

After a few words, Mateo pretended to be generous and walked away.

That was the story I knew.

“Am I annoying? Then let’s fight.”

Mateo provoked Ian.

“I won’t fight with you, you’re not even worth fighting with.”

“You’re weak, I already know that you’re all talk.”

The war of nerves was short-lived.

After a brief snowball fight, Mateo ignored Ian and started walking
again, with his hands stuck in his pockets.

His subordinates – me, and three other male students – followed Mateo.

Like some third-class villains, they stuck out their tongues at Ian or
mocked him as they passed by.

Of course, I followed suit.

***Please don’t faint when fighting demons.***

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

“There’s a girl who always sticks with Ian. ‘Amy Holloway’. She’s the
daughter of Count Holloway.”

Somewhere in the Josena Forest.

The Mateo gang, including me, were gathered in a spacious abandoned
warehouse, having a third-rate villainous strategy meeting.

“Let’s kidnap her.”

“Huh, are we actually gonna kidnap her?!”

The subordinates were startled. I pretended to be surprised on purpose,
too.

As expected, Mateo’s strategy was following the original story.

「Act 2, Chapter 2, The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case」. It was an
incident that took place when Ian’s childhood friend Amy Holloway was
kidnapped by Mateo’s gang.

This was the moment when Ian and Mateo’s gang began to fight in earnest.

“I’m not saying we’re going to do anything bad to Amy Holloway. We’ll
just kidnap her and lock her up somewhere. She’s just a bait to lure in
Ian.”

“Brother, what do you mean…?!”

“It’s a reminder for the nobles that if they look down on us commoners,
they will suffer severe consequences.”

After defeating all of Mateo’s men, Ian confronted Mateo one-on-one.

Meanwhile, a demon appeared. It awoke as a result of Mateo’s extremely
powerful mana.

Of course, the demon’s goal was Ian, who had the light element.

However, the demon attacked the hindrance, Mateo, first. Ian was the
only person who could protect Mateo at that time, since all of his
subordinates were passed out.

Once Ian saved Mateo, the two would form a temporary alliance to defeat
the demon. Mateo then apologized to Ian, and the two became friends.

Anyways, it was the first time I saw Mateo’s gang planning their
strategy, it was kind of fun to see a scene that did not appear in the
original game.

“The first is Ian Fairytale, that cretin. We can’t force him to fight,
so we need to give him a reason to. I intend to thoroughly bring him to
despair.”

“As expected, brother!”

When I was playing the game, I thought he was just a third-class villain
and didn’t think much of it…

But looking at it now, Mateo was a real idiot and one hell of a bastard.

His subordinates were on the same level as him. They all responded by
saying that they would obey Mateo’s will or that they would show the
strength of commoners.

I had two reasons to join Mateo’s gang.

The first was to deal with the demon.

Second was…

“Then the kidnapping…”

“I’ll do it.”

All eyes fell on me.

The second reason I came into Mateo’s gang was…

…To safely kidnap Ian’s childhood friend as well as one of my favorite
characters, Amy Holloway.

“Leave it to me. I want to be of use too, Mateo.”

Mateo’s gang was taken aback by Ian’s unexpectedly good combat skills.

Contrary to Mateo’s intention, he ended up treating Amy quite harshly.

It was probably a story device to escalate the conflict, but I hated it.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

“Keukkukkeukkeukuk.”

“Hahahaha…”

I couldn’t understand why Mateo’s gang was laughing like a bunch of
third-rate villains. But for some reason, it was fun, so I jumped into
the mood and laughed like a villain too.

I felt a sense of belonging as I ate together with Mateo’s gang.

When Mateo got into a fight with someone, we would glare at them from
the side, and we would gather in the abandoned warehouse, to share the
hardships we had to face being neglected by the nobles.

***Well, it’s a group that will disband soon, so I should enjoy it to
the fullest.***

“Keukkeukkeuk.”

“Hahahaha…”

***Hahahaha…***

It was fun.

‘Tomorrow will be the end.’

The final date of the operation was tomorrow.

Somehow, the number of Mateo’s gang increased by two more, but it didn’t
matter.

After all, they were all extras who would get knocked out by Ian anyway.

Even if it was ‘Hell’ difficulty, it was only non-human races that
rapidly increased in difficulty. Humans had a fixed level regardless of
difficulty.

In addition, Ian’s level, which I happened to see earlier, was ’45’. The
level of Mateo’s subordinates was on average in the mid-40s.

On the other hand, Ian had the sizeable advantage of being physically
strong and being good at hand-to-hand combat.

1.  In other words, he was akin to a bully who could easily defeat these
    extras, regardless of how many times he was beaten by demons.

If Ian protected Mateo even once, the situation would be over. Then all
I had to do was step in and deal with the demon.

At least, if there was no obstruction…

Life at the mansion of Duke Astrean was vastly different from that of
any other noble’s daughter.

Gerald Astrean was awarded the title of Duke for his great achievements
in the War of Nies. Considered one of the greatest Sword Saints, he
married the genius wizard Historia, continuing the Astrean family
lineage.

A girl with light green hair, the second born of a Sword Saint and a
genius wizard.

To her, her father, a Sword Saint, was ‘a being to be followed blindly.’

“House Astrean, rise.”

“”KNIGHTS!!!””

When her father said that over the loudspeaker, no matter how deeply she
was dreaming, she had to quickly wake up and make her bed.

“Merlin Astrean!”

“The eldest daughter! Merlin Astrean!”

“Kaya Astrean!”

“The second daughter! Kaya Astrean!”

When calling out her name, she had to put ‘second daughter’ in front of
it and moderate her speech.

As soon as she woke up, she had to immediately gather in front of the
mansion.

“Let out a powerful shout for five seconds.”

““AHHHHHHHHHH─!!!””

“Conduct the morning routine. House Astrean, run!”

“”Yap!!!””

“GO!”

Before sunrise, it was customary for them to run in the morning while
breathing in the moist air.

“Did you play with Arwen instead of studying or not?”

“Play! I’m sorry!”

“Roll to the left.”

“Rolling to the left!!”

“Roll to the right.”

“Rolling to the right!!”

“Do five push-ups. How many times?”

“Five times!!”

“Five times, begin.”

“One, two…! Kuheuk!”

She thought it was too much for a 6-year-old kid.

“Go to bed now. It’s mandatory.”

“What the heck!”

…No, she tried to recall the past, but she only had those memories.

In addition, she had no contact with the opposite sex, restrictions on
snacks, restrictions on play, etc…

Gerald’s own educational philosophy was that children only grew up
righteously when they were raised like soldiers, which had tormented
Kaya her entire life.

At the very least, Kaya was able to have some breathing room and keep
her aristocratic way of speaking due to the generous education policy of
her benevolent mother, Historia.

Still, in front of her father, she had no choice but to follow his
military discipline.

Was it because she’d lived such a stressful life? Kaya developed a habit
of carefully observing the people she cared about since she had to
carefully look into her father’s eyes.

But now, she only cared about one person.

The second place examinee of Märchen Academy’s Magic Department, Kaya
Astrean.

As a result of the class placement evaluation, she was assigned to Class
A, the highest class, yet her joy at being in Class A was fleeting. The
only thing she could think about at the moment was Isaac.

After giving it some thought, she decided to keep an eye on Isaac.

One day, as soon as the class ended, she went looking for Isaac, and
shortly afterward, she noticed him passing by in the distance.

He was flocking with Mateo’s gang for some reason. It was a commoner
group that was frequently mentioned in gossip these past few days.

It was clear that Isaac belonged to the same gang, seeing as they all
wore their bangs up.

***Did they say that they were a group rebelling against the
aristocracy?*** **I heard that they were arguing with aristocrats.**

No matter how talented Mateo Jordana, the leader of that gang was, it
wouldn’t be good to be hated by the aristocracy.

It was like a group of mentally immature adolescents.

However…

‘Why is Sir Isaac in Mateo’s gang…?’

A powerful man who reached the realm of an Archwizard.

Isaac must have had a deep meaning behind this that Kaya herself
couldn’t fathom.

Why did he end up in that gang of bullies?

Kaya couldn’t help but wonder why.

So she decided to tail Isaac.

He was completely influenced by Mateo’s gang, letting out a cheesy laugh
like ‘kekehaha’.

‘Is Isaac laughing like a villain…?’

Kaya, who was watching Isaac with her head sticking out from behind the
pillar, couldn’t keep her mouth shut.

She was sure the strength of Mateo’s gang couldn’t even reach Sir
Isaac’s toes! It was obvious that at Isaac’s level, that kind of gang
would look ridiculous.

But why…?

‘…Is there something going on with that Mateo gang?’

There was only one conclusion that came to mind. Isaac had a deeper
meaning for doing this than she could ever come to understand.

Otherwise, there’s no way Isaac would join such a pathetic group.

Isaac was a mysterious man.

Now that she’d entered Märchen Academy, she had to focus on her studies
and training… but her head was full of thoughts about Isaac these days.

***Why is such a strong man hiding his skills?***

***What a spectacular past he must have had, one I can’t even begin to
imagine.***

***What is the relationship between him and Sylphia, the Emerald
Fairy?***

…Isaac didn’t answer any of her questions, so there was no way to find
out yet.

At the very least, she had to find out for herself why he joined a group
of third-rate bullies.

‘I have no choice but to closely monitor him…!’

The word ‘stalking’ came to mind for some reason, but she shook her
head, telling herself that it wasn’t like that.

Chapter 13: - The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (2)
======================================================

༺ **The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (2)**༻

Amy Holloway, Ian’s childhood friend and one of the heroines.

She had a passive bloodline ability, the neutral magic, \[Heart Color
Discernment\]. Thanks to this, Amy was able to distinguish the colors of
other people’s heart and perceive their true nature.

She could tell whether the other person was lying, what kind of
personality the other person had, and what kind of plot the other person
was hatching.

In other words, she was the number one contributor who assisted the
Holloway family in surviving in an aristocratic society full of intrigue
and deception and rising to the ranks of a Count Family.

Count Holloway cherished his daughter dearly. Because of that, Amy was a
girl who grew up on a bed of roses.

The person she actually met in her flower garden was the second son of
Viscount Fairytale, as well as the main character, Ian Fairytale.

In her eyes, Ian was a boy with a good heart. The two quickly became
friends, and after working hard, they entered Märchen Academy as
classmates.

Yes, at the beginning of the story, Amy’s role was vital.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 2, Chapter 2, Childhood Friend
Kidnapping Case」.

At this time, Mateo’s gang had good timing.

On the day of her planned kidnapping, Amy got into a fight with Ian, and
Mateo’s men approached her at that time and urged her to follow them.

She figured out that they were trying to kidnap her, but she followed
them anyways.

They didn’t seem to have any insidious desires, and she wanted Ian to
value her more.

After all, the man she liked would arrive like a Prince on a white
stallion and save her, in addition to caring for her more after the
event.

In other words, it was just plain stupidity.

Rather, she was able to see through her opponent’s mind, so she easily
fell for the tricks of Mateo’s gang.

As a result, Amy was treated unexpectedly harshly until Ian saved her.

She was slapped and kicked and while Amy was resisting, Mateo’s men were
in a panic because Ian fought better than they thought he would.

Putting Ian in jeopardy because of her own momentary urges and foolish
ideas was not what she wanted.

It was a scene that didn’t sit right with me.

So when the childhood friend kidnapping was over, Amy cried and
apologized to Ian. Since then, she became a devoted heroine and stopped
trolling.

Anyways, it would be easy to kidnap her because of how psychologically
vulnerable she was.

As long as I was here, I wouldn’t allow Amy to be treated roughly.

‘Where’s Amy?’

I remembered the after story of Act 2, Chapter 2.

Amy said that before Mateo’s gang got her, she was mad at Ian and went
somewhere. Where was that exactly…?

‘Oh, right. Hydrangea Garden.’

It was a beautifully decorated garden with colorful hydrangeas. Amy
would be there on the bench.

I was prepared to wander around for a long time, but luckily enough I
was able to easily find Amy sitting on a bench in anguish.

***Let’s start with the bangs first, since I’m alone now.***

I lowered my curly bangs down and walked over to Amy.

Suddenly, several emotions crossed my mind.

While playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I went through Amy’s route
quite a few times.

I always liked her bright smile, which seemed to be in full bloom.

That’s why I was fond of her and had many memories of her. One of the
characters I wanted to cherish was Amy.

As I stopped in front of Amy, she looked up at me with her beautiful
green eyes. She was a white, short-haired woman and had a ribbon shaped
like black rabbit ears. She looked like a puppy with her big eyes and
had a cute overall appearance.

It was the first time we had officially met each other. As expected, she
looked like she had question marks all over her face.

\[Amy Holloway\] **Lv:** 51

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire

**Danger:** X

“Amy Holloway?”

“…?”

Amy must be seeing through my intentions with \[Heart Color
Discernment\].

There was nothing to hide.

So, let’s make an offer as politely as possible.

“I’m sorry, but I’m trying to kidnap you. Will you cooperate?”

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

Is he crazy?

Amy was taken aback by what the man in front of her had just said. She
didn’t know what to say, so she just stared blankly at him for a while.

Silver hair with a slight blue hue and blood-red eyes that looked at
Amy.

She knew who he was. His name was Isaac. In addition to being judged as
Grade E in mana, he was ranked last in the class placement evaluation. A
man who was at the bottom. He even came from a commoner origin.

He was a man famous for such bad things, so she couldn’t help but know
him.

But Amy didn’t look down on him. On the contrary, she couldn’t
understand why the students at this academy were so eager to put others
down.

Was it because her childhood friend, Ian, who she had a crush on, was
also judged with Grade E mana and became the subject of humiliation by
the other students?

The fact angered Amy, but there was nothing she could do. Except for
being by Ian’s side.

Somehow, unlike the other students, Amy felt sympathy for Isaac.

But what did such a man say all of a sudden…?

Did she hear him wrong?

“Kidnap?”

“Kidnap.”

Isaac answered clearly as if to confirm.

Amy was able to see the color of Isaac’s heart thanks to the ever-active
\[Heart Color Discernment\] magic. She saw a bright blue color with a
slight orange tinge. It was a color devoid of impure intentions.

Therefore, when he said ‘kidnapping’, it didn’t seem like it was a real
‘kidnapping.’

It was only natural, who in their right mind would kidnap in such a
manner? It would only be a true kidnapping if he exercised force from
the beginning, or tried to deceive and entice her before taking her
away.

‘This is the first time we’ve talked with each other… Why is he showing
affection to me?’

The orange color of the heart meant friendliness, affection, and liking
toward Amy. A color usually seen in family or close friends. It was a
color that represented goodwill when seen by someone for the first time.

It was a color that could turn pink, signifying love between the
opposite sexes at any time.

But this was the first time Amy had seen Isaac.

That means…

‘Did he get bewitched without even realizing it?!’

As he passed by, she must have won Isaac’s liking for her pure beauty.

She was embarrassed but the corners of her mouth couldn’t help but
twitch. She covered her cheeks and turned her head to the side.

‘You sinful woman… Oh my gosh, what should I do?!’

She didn’t have any special feelings for Isaac, but she felt like her
self-esteem went up thanks to him.

Amy was upset at Ian, as he had been neglecting her these days. Even the
color of his heart had faded…

This caused her to feel a strong sense of skepticism about the fact that
her self-made appearance, which she had worked hard to maintain, was
unable to win Ian’s heart.

Of course, rationally, she understood that Ian was focused on his
training. But he’s been too neglectful recently…

***Is it training, or is it me?***

She wanted to ask that, but her pride wouldn’t allow it. In the first
place, she and Ian were not even in a romantic relationship. Revealing
this desire for exclusivity was a shortcut to disaster.

Yes. She and Ian were just damn childhood friends. She was just his
friend, his friend…

‘Stupid Ian. Why don’t you try to be a little jealous?’

Amy wanted to get back at Ian.

“Puhuh. Kidnapping, that’s funny. It’s Isaac, right?”

Amy smiled brightly as she spoke in a curt tone.

“Do you want to talk to me somewhere privately?”

“Well… Alright?”

“I wish there were delicious refreshments and black tea. I’m pretty
picky.”

“I don’t know about black tea, but there are some handmade chocolates
made with special grade A milk, directly imported from Ailo Farm, and
cocoa from Doark.”

“… Huh?”

Amy’s eyes started glowing with curiosity.

Before she knew it, she jumped up and stuck her head out at Isaac.

Isaac, startled, reflexively pulled his upper body back.

Regardless of his reaction, Amy asked in an excited voice.

“Gee, what kind of chocolate is that…? I’ve never heard of it, is it
good?”

Her voice trembled with excitement.

If it was Amy who was obsessed with ‘sweets’, she could confidently say
that she had eaten all the sweets in this world.

So, the homemade chocolate Isaac mentioned was enough to arouse her
curiosity.

“I have one, so try it.”

Isaac pulled a small piece of chocolate the size of a finger from his
pocket and handed it to Amy. The chocolate was wrapped in paper.

Amy exclaimed when she saw the pretty packaging design.

Her expression melted as she put the brown chocolate inside her mouth.

“What do you think?”

“So sweet…”

After swallowing the chocolate, Amy was immersed in the lingering taste
for a while.

She soon came to her senses, cleared her throat awkwardly, and nodded.

“Umm, yes, that’s good. It was delicious, do you have any more
chocolates?”

“If you follow me, I’ll give you more.”

“Alright.”

Amy covered her expression and gave Isaac a lively smile.

“I’ll be kidnapped! Where do you want to go?”

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

“Wow, there’s a place like this!”

I brought Amy to a small house somewhere in Josena Forest. Initially, it
had been an abandoned warehouse, but it was cleaned under the pretext of
kidnapping. One of Mateo’s subordinates knew how to handle the wind
element, so it was easy to clean off the dust.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there was content related to creating and
decorating your own hideout. This abandoned building was one of those
places.

I guided Amy to a table with refreshments.

“Sit here, I’ll make you some tea.”

“…”

Amy’s mind was already focused on the pile of chocolates on the table.

After settling her down in a chair, I headed for the kitchen. Even
though it was called a kitchen, it was just a small space with one
partition.

There, I placed a kettle filled with water on top of a scroll engraved
with the 1-star fire spell \[Fire Generation\] magic circle, and started
boiling it.

***But this situation. It’s kind of… How should I say this…***

‘Isn’t it too easy…?’

I thought it would work, but I didn’t think I could lure Amy with just
one chocolate…

Oh, of course, the chocolate I used was an effective item limited to
Amy.

The chocolates I had prepared in advance were bought with the kidnapping
money I received from Mateo. I bought it from the secret shop since it
was cheap.

The chocolate was originally one of the gift items to increase the
favorability of the heroine. The effect was most noticeable for Amy
Holloway, who has a sweet tooth. It was a must-buy item if you wanted to
see Amy’s lover’s ending.

That was why I knew that Amy would like it.

Of course, it was her \[Heart Color Discernment\] skill that played the
major part.

‘What are you doing, Amy?’

I peered through the partition and looked at Amy.

She tried to keep her composure while reaching out for the chocolates,
but she was stopping herself with her other hand.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

“Isn’t it too much? We’ve been together for so many years, but he always
ignores me saying ‘I have to train’…”

Amy and I had a simple tea party with chocolate and tea.

Because I had been playing the game so much, I apparently had a lot to
say to Amy. When I started talking, stories came to mind and words just
started flowing out.

Thanks to that, the atmosphere was never awkward from beginning to end.

As if relieved by the chocolate and black tea, Amy kept complaining to
me. Of course, it was about Ian.

“I’ve been so good to him, that ungrateful bastard…”

“You like Ian, don’t you?”

“…Uh huh?!”

I blurted out what I already knew. Amy had left a plethora of clues
behind, enough to warrant this much thought.

Amy, feeling embarrassed, blushed as expected.

“Ah, me, he, no? Not really?”

“Really? Just by looking at it, you like Ian a lot, right?”

“It’s not, that’s not… true…”

It was cute to see her try to deny it.

In Ian’s position, I had been playing &lt;Marchen’s Magic Knight&gt; for
a long time.

I didn’t know how many times I’d seen her.

Should I have called this affection like that of one towards a daughter?
Even though I’ve never been married.

“There’s no more chocolate.”

“Oh, yes! Chocolate! Chocolate… I ate it all, sorry…”

I deliberately changed the topic and Amy replied to it, feeling somewhat
guilty.

“Would you like some more chocolate?”

“Ah oh? Ah, I’m not the type to eat that much, but, well, if you were to
give me more, wouldn’t it be hard to refuse, even out of sincerity?”

What are you talking about…?

“Just wait a little bit. I’ll be right back.”

“Huh? Where are you going?”

I stood up and headed towards the door.

“I put it somewhere else. I made something like a mini-fridge and stored
it there since I’m an ice element user. But it’s a bit far away.”

“Why? Wouldn’t it be nice to just install a mini-refrigerator here or in
front?”

“I’m still not good at controlling it. It could cause harm to this house
for no reason, so I deliberately kept it far away.”

“Ah\~.”

She didn’t seem entirely convinced. But Amy did not ask any further
questions.

If she asked, ‘Can’t you use an ice magic scroll?’ I was going to reply
that I don’t have any gel.

If she asked why I didn’t have gel, I was going to say I was robbed.

If she asked me, ‘Who robbed you?’ I was going to say I don’t know
because it was at night…

Well, that was fortunate.

It seemed that she wanted to eat more chocolate as soon as possible.

“Oh, do you want me to go with you? I will follow you.”

“You’re kidnapped. You should wait here.”

“Pufu, that’s right\~ that’s right, I was supposed to be kidnapped by
this evening, right?”

Amy laughed, she seemed to think of this as a joke. She probably thought
that she was a ‘guest’ and that being ‘kidnapped’ was my joke.

I would have thought the same. After all, I said the kidnapping was due
this evening.

It was easier for me if she took it as a joke, since I wanted to make
Amy feel comfortable.

“Ah, today was fun\~, let’s be friends when we get back, Isaac.”

***Friends, huh… I don’t know. Now, Ian, whom you like, will be hurt by
Mateo and the demon.***

I smiled and said, “I’ll be back,” then left the hideout.

Before I knew it, the sky was dyed the color of the sunset.

On my way to bring Amy, I placed a sharpened stone at a marked spot in
front of a tree in the Josena Forest. It was a signal that meant ‘I
succeeded in kidnapping Amy’.

Following that, Ian would receive a letter informing him that Amy had
been kidnapped.

He’d storm into the abandoned warehouse and begin fighting Mateo’s gang.

‘Isn’t it still a long time before the demon appears?’

When the demon appeared, the sky would begin to darken.

It would awaken and remain beneath the abandoned warehouse before
emerging when it sensed Mateo’s dense magic power.

So, it was still a long way off. There would be plenty of time to
observe the situation in front of the warehouse.

All I had to do was kill the demon to prevent a bad ending.

Furthermore, if I defeated the demon this time, I would receive the
‘Abyssal Ring’ as a reward. An item that could read an opponent’s mind.
In &lt;Marchen’s Magic Knight&gt;, I used it to read a number of
opponents’ minds during battle.

In other words, the Abyssal Ring would be of great help in dealing with
all kinds of variables in the future.

‘There’s no issue with the kidnapping, and nothing particularly unusual
comes to mind.’

I took my time walking toward the abandoned warehouse.

The only variable that came to mind, would be if the demon appeared
early. An example of this would be if Mateo went ahead and used mana
before his subordinates.

It would be a dangerous situation that hastened the bad ending, but I
hoped that wouldn’t happen…

When playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Mateo attacked Ian only after
all his men were defeated.

Well, this one should be easy.

There’s no contact with someone meddlesome like Kaya, so there would be
no one to interfere.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

Two hours ago.

Kaya Astrean was wandering around the academy grounds.

‘Where did Isaac go?’

She couldn’t find Isaac.

At best, she found Mateo’s gang, but everyone was there except for
Isaac.

In addition, the actions of Mateo’s gang today were somehow suspicious.

Thanks to Kaya’s recent tailing of Isaac, she discovered that they were
using an abandoned warehouse in the Josena Forest as a hideout.

They entered Josena forest and proceeded to the abandoned warehouse as
usual, but then they began to carefully look at a tree.

Afterward, all but one of Mateo’s men headed to the abandoned warehouse.

The remaining one turned and left Josena Forest and headed for the Magic
Department building, Orphin Hall. Kaya followed him.

The man looked around, then he secretly slipped a letter into Ian’s
locker, and quickly ran away.

*What is that? Hopefully, it’s not a love letter.*

After Kaya confirmed that the man had left, she took out the letter from
Ian’s locker and read it.

\[We have Amy Holloway with us.\]

\[Come to the abandoned warehouse in Josena Forest.\]

\[Come alone.\]

“A hostage…?”

Kaya’s hands trembled.

‘They’ve gone too far…!’

Mateo’s gang was notorious. The letter must have been aimed at harassing
an aristocrat named Ian Fairytale.

But she still couldn’t believe they took a hostage…!

“…Kaya Astrean?”

Just in time, Ian appeared at the locker.

Puzzled, he spoke to Kaya, who was standing in front of his locker.

“That’s my locker.”

“Are you Ian Fairytale? Look at this.”

Ian’s expression darkened as he read the letter Kaya gave him.

“Amy…! Mateo, that bastard…”

“Mr. Ian.”

Kaya then made a suggestion to the enraged Ian.

She said she would help.

━─━─━━─━「₪」━━─━─━─━

The sky was dyed the color of the sunset.

After searching Josena forest, Ian arrived at an abandoned warehouse.

Mateo’s gang greeted him with giggles.

“Where is Amy?”

Ian asked in a raspy voice.

He had a training wooden sword in his right hand, but it only seemed
ridiculous to Mateo’s gang.

“Tell me right now. This is a warning.”

“Warning?”

“…!”

*Faaaaaaaaa-!*

Behind Ian’s back, a barrier formed at the door. It was neutral magic
from one of Mateo’s gang.

「Barrier—Physical Defense Specialization (Neutral Element, ★2 )」

Despite being a basic barrier, it specialized in physical defense. No
matter how strong he was among his peers, Ian would be unable to easily
break through that barrier.

“Who’s talking, you?”

Mateo’s voice weighed down.

“A Grade E, giving a warning? A warning?”

“No, it’s more interesting when you have that kind of backbone.”

Mateo’s men approached Ian, but he showed no signs of fear. On the
contrary, he appeared disappointed.

“…It was a real warning.”

It was then.

*Whooooooooosh-!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa-!!*

Suddenly, a wall of the abandoned warehouse crumbled and a violent wind
rushed toward Mateo’s gang.

「Gust (Wind Element, ★4)」

“…!”

“Aaaagh!”

“Kuwahhh!”

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuu-!*

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4 )」

Before the wind magic hit the abandoned warehouse, a rock wall rose
around Mateo to protect him. He quickly deployed the rock defense magic
\[Rock Wall\]. His reflexes were like those of a wild animal.

However, all of Mateo’s gang were unprepared for wind magic and were
swept away by **「**Gust**」**.

They slammed against the wall on the other side, fell to the floor, and
then passed out.

As the storm subsided,

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

A fierce wind began to encircle the abandoned warehouse at a female
student’s command.

After Mateo dispelled the \[Rock Wall\], his eyes widened as he looked
at the source of the wind magic.

The walls of the abandoned warehouse were breached by the \[Gust\]. A
female student with light green pigtails stood nearby, holding a wand
with a small green mana stone embedded inside of it. Her hair and skirt
fluttering in the wind.

Weapons similar to wands increased the power of magic being released,
but the complexity of the magic operation made them difficult to handle
at a student’s level. Only a few first-year students were currently
capable of handling such weapons.

And a female student of that caliber appeared on the scene.

“Did my warning sound like a joke?”

She was the first year second seat of the Magic Department, with more
power than anyone else here—

—Kaya Astrean.

<span

Chapter 14: - The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (3)
======================================================

༺ **The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case (3)**༻

“Why are you…?”

Mateo frowned. He never imagined that Kaya, the second seat, would break
in.

He had no idea what happened, but under these circumstances, it was
clear that she had joined hands with Ian. In other words, she is an
enemy.

He would fight back, but in the face of Kaya’s powerful magic, the
outcome of the battle was already set in stone.

“Mateo, where is Amy?”

Before Mateo knew it, Ian was approaching him. Mateo, however, only gave
him a sidelong glance, as he was wary of Kaya. Kaya’s wind, which was
dominating the abandoned warehouse, would attack him fiercely if he
moved carelessly.

A stream of cold sweat ran down Mateo’s cheek.

“Answer me.”

*Chuck-*

Ian said menacingly, pointing his wooden sword at Mateo.

A man whom he considered insignificant, an aristocrat whom he hated,
drew a wooden sword at him.

Mateo was furious and his eyes turned red with rage.

“How dare you command me…!”

*Drurrrrrrrrrrrrr─!*

The moment Mateo was about to cast a rock spell at Ian, a wall of ice
protruded from the ground, standing between the two.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4 )」

Mateo was startled and quickly retreated, believing it was an attack.

He turned to face the ice spellcaster. Kaya’s wand had formed a light
blue magic circle, which she was pointing at Mateo. It was the \[Ice
Wall\] spell.

“Answer me.”

The \[Ice Wall\] turned into blue powder and scattered.

Even Kaya’s wind threatened Mateo.

As long as she was there, Mateo couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t even
deal a blow to Ian Fairytale, who was right in front of him.

It was a critical situation.

Mateo gulped.

“…?”

At that moment.

A strange and ominous mana swept over the abandoned warehouse.

Kaya, Mateo, and Ian’s gazes were drawn to it instinctively.

Their survival instincts set off an alarm in their heads.

Black mana rose slowly and started concentrating in the middle of the
abandoned warehouse.

\[Shaaaaa…\]

\[Sueuuuuuuuu…\]

The black mana let out a weird cry, transforming into a strange
two-headed creature. It stood three meters tall with gray-brown skin
while the eyes protruded from the sides of the cheekbones, which
resembled a hammerhead shark. His black-clad body was extremely short,
and his legs were unusually long and flaccid.

Both his arms were shaped like shark fins, but they were long enough to
reach the tips of his toes.

In a hoarse voice, the two heads said ‘shaaaaa’ and ‘sueuuu’. The
students’ expressions became solemn as they stared at the hideous
creature.

“W-what is that…?”

They immediately guessed the identity of the strange creature.

“A demon…?”

That was… an existence that was considered a natural disaster, a
‘Demon’.

\[Shaaaaa—!\]

\[Sueuuuu-!\]

The two-headed shark demon roared at Ian and Mateo, and a blue magic
circle appeared beneath the demon’s feet, followed by a ring of dark
water reminiscent of the deep sea.

The ring of water instantly transformed into a wave that slammed into
the students.

「Tidal Wave (Water Element, ★6)」 + 「Black Water (Water Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Wave (Water Element)」

*Pyuuuuuuuuuu-!!*

“Ugghhh!”

Kaya quickly deployed a \[Ice Wall\] towards herself and Mateo’s fainted
minions, while Mateo built a \[Rock Wall\] to protect himself from the
raging waves.

However, their defensive spells were destroyed with a single \[Black
Wave\].

Ian, on the other hand, could only concentrate light mana in the sword
he had brought with him because he didn’t know how to use defensive
magic.

“Khuhh!”

The \[Ice Wall\] was successful in protecting those covered by it until
the very end, while the \[Rock Wall\] was shattered and failed to serve
its purpose.

At the same time, Ian’s sword skill proved insufficient in driving away
the demon’s \[Black Wave\].

Ian and Mateo were both swept away by the waves, the impact felt as if
something had exploded inside of them.

The \[Black Wave\] shattered the walls of the abandoned warehouse with
immense force and hurled them into the forest.

The two people rolled on the ground and bumped into a tree. As the clear
black water settled down, the two men were huddled together like
drowning mice.

“Are you okay?!”

Kaya shouted urgently at Ian and Mateo, but had to turn her gaze back to
the demon without having time to care for them.

To get out of this critical situation, she had to defeat that dangerous
being.

\[Shaaaaa—!\]

\[Sueuuuuuuu-!\]

Once more, a ring of black water rose around the demon.

Mateo coughed up blood and water from his mouth. He wanted to avoid the
attack, but his body refused to listen. In the face of such powerful
magic, even \[Rock Wall\] would be meaningless.

It was a futile end.

He recalled the plan to kidnap Amy Holloway and defeat Ian in order to
threaten the nobility.

The small throbbing in his chest that he had faintly felt during the
gang meeting deepened.

In the midst of a sense of skepticism, Mateo lowered his head.

“What are you doing?”

A man’s voice came from the front, causing Mateo to raise his head.

A man with black hair was standing in front of him, holding his wooden
sword and glaring at the demon.

“Ian Fairytale…”

“If you don’t want to be protected by me, get up quickly. It’s hard to
even protect myself.”

Mateo couldn’t understand Ian’s words. Wouldn’t it be natural to use him
as a shield or to run away? Nobility was such a thing.

***But instead, he says he will protect me*.** ***Me, who was also an
enemy?***

The thought that the second son of Viscount Fairytale came up with such
an idea was hard to accept.

He didn’t even have the strength to protect himself in the first place.

But Mateo looked at Ian’s back and felt his heart tightening.

In fact, he was well aware that not all nobles regarded commoners with
contempt. He was simply ignoring it.

He couldn’t control his rage after witnessing his parents, a commoner
and a housekeeper, being abused and bullied in an aristocratic mansion.

“…”

Mateo stretched out his arm and sent a stream of rock mana.

A wall of solid rock formed in front of Ian.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

“You…?”

Startled, Ian turned his head back to stare at Mateo, but he had no time
to talk as a second \[Black Wave\] hit them.

*Pyuuuuuuuuuu-!!*

To protect herself and Mateo’s subordinates, Kaya made another \[Ice
Wall\] and tried countering with \[Gust\].

With her magic, she couldn’t even break the momentum of the \[Black
Wave\].

A torrent surged towards them like a tsunami with the speed of a cannon.

“Keuk!!”

“Kyaaa!”

The \[Ice Wall\] that was protecting Kaya and the \[Rock Wall\] that was
protecting Ian and Mateo were both smashed once again.

The shockwave sent Kaya’s body flying backwards.

Even though it was water, the pressure felt like a giant sledgehammer.

The tree Mateo was leaning on was smashed, and he and Ian were once
again swept away by the waves while being tossed around the forest for a
while.

Ian finally lost consciousness. The last act he managed to do was get up
and use his remaining strength to protect Mateo from the evil being.

Mateo coughed up blood and looked down at the ground helplessly. His
whole body was damp. He didn’t even have the strength to raise his head.

All he could see was mud.

“Ugh…”

Meanwhile, Kaya rose from the floor, trembling.

A ring of black water was rising without mercy. The third \[Black Wave\]
was approaching.

The demon didn’t even give them a chance to fight back.

Soon, the \[Black Wave\] came flying toward Kaya, the unconscious Ian,
and Mateo.

In that fleeting moment, Kaya knew that she was going to die.

“…!”

Then suddenly.

The air began to clear, and a cold, overwhelming basic elemental magic
seemingly froze everything on the battlefield.

Kaya’s eyes widened.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1 )」

*Charaakkkkkk——!!*

In the blink of an eye, the gushing \[Black Wave\] froze. The magic lost
its momentum and became like a sculpture.

Kaya looked around, surprised.

Amidst the cold chill, a scene as if time had stopped was reflected in
her eyes.

“Move aside, Kaya.”

“…Ah.”

A voice as cold as ice, heavier than a glacier.

The feeling of survival overtook Kaya.

She quickly turned to face the man behind her.

Blood-red eyes and blue-silver hair. A man dressed in a first-year
uniform from Märchen Academy’s Magic Department.

Kaya uttered his name in relief.

“Isaac!”

༛༛ ༛ ༛༺༻༛ ༛ ༛༛

***No, no, what’s happening?***

***What’s going on here?***

\[Orpheus the Submerged\] **Lv:** 110

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Water

**Danger:** High

As soon as I came to the abandoned warehouse, I couldn’t help but freak
out.

A severely damaged warehouse with a demon emerging from within.

The sunset glow had yet to fade from the sky… It was fast, too fast!

‘Why is Kaya here…?’

I had no idea how Kaya got here, but it seemed Orpheus the Submerged
sensed her powerful mana and appeared sooner than expected.

According to the story, it was supposed to sense Mateo’s mana and appear
when Ian and Mateo were fighting.

‘Whew, this almost got screwed up…’

I almost ran out of time. Ian would have fallen if I were even a second
slower, and this world would have met a bad ending.

The original plan was for me to put on the Magic Cloak of Disguise,
defeat the demon, and escape.

However, I felt that the situation was going awry, and rushed over
without a chance to put on my Cloak of Disguise.

‘Anyways, we got over the bad ending.’

Fortunately, Ian and Mateo were lying down in mud together.

The fact that the two were together meant that Ian has created a
situation where he protected Mateo.

Even though things went wrong, somehow it worked out the way I wanted it
to. Now it was time to clean up.

There was only one thing left to do.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** (130)

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman

**Mana:** 35990/36000

– Mana Recovery Speed (A-)

– Stamina (A)

– Strength (A+)

– Intelligence (C-)

– Willpower (S)

From the moment I decided to fight Orpheus, the \[Hunter\] trait
activated and my level and abilities skyrocketed.

It was also possible to freeze his \[Black Wave\] with only \[Ice
Generation\]. My level and elemental synergy were superior. I should
have no trouble killing him.

The ice melted right away. The frozen \[Black Wave\] became dark blue
powder and scattered in the air.

\[Shaaaaa?\]

\[Sueuuuuu?\]

Orpheus the Submerged glared at me with a perplexed expression.

For some reason, I felt a gaze from the direction of Ian and Mateo. I
glanced at them sideways and saw Mateo staring at me in disbelief.

It seemed he hadn’t fainted yet.

Mateo had a big mouth, so I needed to keep his mouth shut.

“Healing magic, do you know how to cast it?”

“Yes? Ah yes!”

I knew that Kaya could use healing magic, but I deliberately asked and
checked. If I made her question how I knew that, I might get a headache
for nothing.

Mateo’s subordinates looked unharmed, so I gestured my chin towards Ian
and Mateo.

“Go over there, and heal them while I defeat the demon.”

“Alright!”

Kaya flew towards them, imbuing herself with wind magic.

Next, I approached Orpheus.

It would now be an exchange of large-scale magic. I had to make sure the
others didn’t get swept away.

I lightly waved my index finger wrapped in mana and a translucent ice
curtain surrounded Kaya, Ian, Mateo, and Mateo’s subordinates.

“This…”

I heard Kaya’s voice. She must have stopped on the way to Ian and Mateo.

This one had a much thicker concentration of mana than the simple \[Ice
Curtain\].

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★6 )」

A shield that protected the caster with ice magic. Even if I used 9-star
magic, I would be safe as long as I had that \[Ice Barrier\].

“Isaac, what are you going to do…?”

I heard Kaya’s worried voice.

***What do you mean? I just have to defeat the demon.***

\[Shaaaaaaaaa─!\]

\[Sueueuuuuu─!\]

As Orpheus roared, a large blue magic circle formed beneath me. It was a
trail of deep blue light, like the color of the sea.

‘Already the \[Waterspout\] pattern?’

Orpheus used \[Waterspout\] whenever his HP fell below 50% and when it
dropped below 30%, he applied \[Black Water\] to \[Waterspout\] as a
last resort.

Seeing as he was about to use that last resort right away, he seemed
scared of me.

Before I knew it, water mana began to swirl around me.

Its size increased in an instant, and it took the form of a huge
whirlwind; a dark-colored water tornado, a combination of water and
darkness.

「Waterspout (Water Element, ★6 )」+ 「Black Water (Water Element, ★5
)」

= 「Black Dragon Ascension (Water Element)」

*Pyuuuuuuuuuuu─────!!*

The water prison instantly tightened without any openings to escape
through.

The water tornado blew away the abandoned warehouse’s roof and continued
into the sky. There was no end in sight.

If I was swept away by this water tornado, I would soar into the sky
while suffocating from the agony of being torn apart by intense water
pressure without even a chance to breathe. That was what happened when
you got hit by Orpheus’ \[Waterspout\] pattern. \[Black Dragon
Ascension\] in particular was unparalleled in terms of power.

A black tornado reached for the sky.

Freezing the mana of such a powerful, fast-spinning, and large body of
water would be difficult to do with a simple \[Ice Generation\].

However, now that I had a stronger skill than \[Ice Generation\], it
should be fine.

I gently stretched out my hand and poured a large amount of mana, the
mana then scattered dark blue light and spread out all at once.

「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Charaakkkkk—————!!!*

The water tornado froze in an instant. A huge pillar of ice was soaring
into the sky.

I immediately released the ice mana that froze \[Black Dragon
Ascension\].

*Crack—!*

As the black ice pillars, which soared like the Tower of Babel,
shattered, they turned into a large amount of dark blue powder and flew
back down the sky.

The \[Black Dragon Ascension\] disappeared without a trace. A look of
panic was visible on Orpheus’ face for the first time.

I approached Orpheus and held out my open palm.

As cold mana flowed and condensed, a light blue magic circle appeared in
front of my right hand.

\[Shaaaaaa…!\]

\[Sueuuuuu…!\]

Orpheus was unable to flee.

When I used \[Black Ice\], the ground on Orpheus’ side froze as well.
His legs had frozen, rendering him immobile.

“Let’s finish this.”

I released the condensed cold mana and at the same time, ice rushed in.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak—!!!*

The exploding ice engulfed Orpheus, tore through the abandoned
warehouse, and ran wild through Josena Forest.

It grew in size until it resembled a massive iceberg.

A cold wind blew wildly. The abandoned warehouse was frozen solid, and a
faint cold air flowed as I sighed.

On the other hand, the other students were not affected by my magic
thanks to the \[Ice Barrier\].

Soon, the block of ice shattered at once, turning into blue powder and
scattering in all directions.

\[Shaaaaaaaaa…\]

\[Sueuuuuuuu…\]

Orpheus was bleeding purple blood and his entire body was in shambles.

Orpheus fell and turned into gray powder before vanishing.

*Tukkk-.*

A small earring fell and tumbled across the ground where Orpheus
vanished.

I wouldn’t have noticed it at first glance, but because I was already
aware of the reward, I recognized it without difficulty.

It was the ‘Abyssal Ring’.

Chapter 15: - The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case - Interlude
==============================================================

༺ **The Childhood Friend Kidnapping Case – Interlude**༻

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Orpheus the Submerged (Lv
110)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 36!\]
You’ve gained 12 stat points! \[You have unlocked the achievement ❰My
Childhood Friend Is Safe❱! You have gained an additional 10 bonus stat
points!\]

I dropped to one knee and picked up the Abyssal Ring. It was a thin,
rusty, ultramarine blue earring with strange rune-like characters
engraved on it.

\[You have obtained the loot \[Abyssal Ring\]!\] \[Abyssal Ring\] When
worn, you can read the other person’s psychological state.

If worn for 7 days, this item loses all functionality, then even if not
worn, you can read the other person’s psychological state.

Rank: Tier 1

The Abyssal Ring was an earring that could be worn on the ear’s pinna.
When I wore this and looked at my opponent, I could see their
psychological state through the status window.

Originally, it was an item that Ian should take, but it would be much
more useful for me to take it than a Master Fainter. If he ever had to
use it in the first place, I could step in and solve it.

I had no intention of giving Ian any loot, unless it was absolutely
necessary for the sake of the story, or if it was something I could
spare.

I turned to face Ian and Mateo as I cleared the ice that surrounded the
abandoned warehouse. Kaya stared at me in awe as she cast her healing
magic on them.

For definitive treatment, they would need to visit priests specializing
in healing magic, or be taken to the hospital. Kaya’s magic was only for
first aid.

Ian, on the other hand, had a monster-like resilience due to his light
element constitution. Kaya’s magic would be sufficient to heal him.

Now that things had calmed down, I thought of testing the Abyssal Ring.

I clipped the ultramarine blue earring on my right earlobe. It shrank to
fit the size of my earlobe and gave off a cold, metallic sensation.

\[You have learned the passive skill \[Psychological Insight (★7)\]!\]

I gained a passive skill that activated on the condition that I was
wearing the Abyssal Ring, but if I wore this earring for seven days, the
condition would cease to exist.

I covered my ear with my right hand so that neither Kaya nor Mateo, who
were staring at me, would notice.

Then I looked at Ian, who had fainted first.

\[Ian Fairytale\] **Lv:** 43

**Race:** Human

**Element:** Light, Fire

**Danger:** X

**Psychology**: \[ \]

As expected, a new ‘Psychology’ section was added to the status window.
Because Ian was unconscious, it appeared to be empty.

\[Mateo Jordana\] **Lv:** 76

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Confused by the fact that you are strong.\]

Mateo was staring at me. It was the first time I had seen someone’s face
filled with surprise, doubt, and admiration. Among them, ‘doubt’ seemed
to be the most prevalent.

Ah, Mateo’s level increased by 1 too. It was most likely due to the team
EXP.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 91

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[In awe of you.\]

‘Awe, what?’

Kaya looked like an ardent believer looking at the cult leader.

‘…Well, she’s leveled up by 1 too.’

***Phew, know that you’re stronger because of me.***

I removed the Abyssal Ring from my ear and put it in my pocket. From
tomorrow on, it would be natural to wear this as a normal accessory.

I then proceeded to walk toward Kaya, Ian, and Mateo. Mateo had a
confused expression on his face as he looked at me. Because of the
shock, he seemed to be unable to speak.

Well, I didn’t really have anything to say to him.

“Kaya.”

“Yes, Sir Isaac.”

When I stopped in front of Kaya and started talking to her, I was taken
aback. Looking up close, her eyes shined so brightly, to the point of
being overwhelming.

***…First of all, I’d like to ask Kaya something.***

“Are you here to help Ian?”

“Yes, ah! Sir Isaac, do you know Amy Holloway? I heard she was
kidnapped…”

“I kept her someplace safe.”

“I knew it!”

Kaya exclaimed as if she had predicted this. Her pupils were still
shining in an overwhelming manner.

“I’ll handle the aftermath. I’m going to take these guys to the
hospital, get them treated, and tell them to keep their mouths shut!”

I didn’t say anything, but she knew exactly what I wanted. For some
reason, I didn’t dislike this sensation.

The only thing that made me feel burdened right now was her longing
gaze, which was not in the least bit ashamed.

As I felt a tickle in my heart, a small smile crept across my lips.

“Thank you.”

When I said such heartfelt words, the corners of Kaya’s mouth twitched
violently and her lips started trembling. It was the expression she made
when someone she admired complimented her.

***I’m actually just a nobody, yet you look at me like that…***

***What can I say? I’m kind of flattered.***

“And keep quiet about the appearance of the demon this time.”

“Yes? Why is that…? Ah! I see.”

I was about to explain the reason for this ruse, but when she said she
knew right away, I was left speechless.

I wasn’t sure what kind of thought process was involved, but it didn’t
matter as long as she did what I wanted.

It brought back memories of the time I played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.
Soon, Mateo’s subordinates would wake up and they would help Mateo and
head to the hospital.

It was the end of that situation.

I gave Kaya a nod and began moving to where I had ‘kidnapped’ Amy.

Throughout the walk, I could feel Kaya’s burdening gaze as well as
Mateo’s suspicious gaze.

I purposefully avoided looking back and hurried my steps.

As the sun set, the sky began to darken.

The transition from sunset to ultramarine blue was stunning.

━━━━━「₪」━━━━━

“I brought you more chocolate.”

“Oh! You’re here!”

Amy jumped out of her seat and rushed to me like a rabbit when I arrived
at the hideout.

When she asked for chocolate, her eyes glowed like those of a
Pomeranian.

“It’s a little later than I thought. But isn’t it cold outside? I feel
chilly for some reason, don’t you?”

Amy inquired, her voice full of worries.

It appeared to be because of me constantly emitting cold air while
fighting the Orpheus the Submerged.

I scratched my cheek and laughed awkwardly.

“I don’t want you catching a cold.”

“What are you doing?”

Amy suddenly extended her hand to me, and a faint flame appeared in
front of her outstretched hand.

*Crackle-*

「Fire Generation (Fire Element, ★1)」

***Oh, it’s warm.***

“Ah, thank you.”

“I’m the one who’s thankful. Today was so much fun, and the chocolate
was delicious too… By the way, Isaac, what’s your answer?”

“Answer?”

“I asked you to be friends.”

Come to think of it, I didn’t properly answer her request to be friends
before I left.

But she was about to hear it all from Ian… She should be able to figure
out why I brought her here pretty quickly.

I wasn’t sure how she would react then.

***Still, why do I have to avoid it now?***

“Friend… That’s good.”

“Hehe.”

Amy smiled brightly while basking in the warmth of the flames. Her smile
was sincere, like a blooming flower.

━━━━━「₪」━━━━━

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 2, Chapter 2, The Childhood Friend
Kidnapping Case」 was over. After escorting Amy out of Josena Forest, we
parted ways in front of the dormitory. She belonged to ‘Briggs Hall,’
which housed students from the middle and lower classes.

I decided not to eat dinner. Since I was enjoying refreshments with Amy,
I wasn’t that hungry.

In the dark night, I went to a deserted corner of the garden to check my
potential.

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 22 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training

‘My level increased by 6, and I got a total of 22 stat points. If it’s
22…’

My first goal was to master \[Frost Explosion\]. In other words, I had
already decided where I would invest my stat points.

I poured all 22 stat points into \[Magic Training Efficiency\].

\[Potential \[Magic Training Efficiency\] has improved from C+ to B+!\]

‘Grade B+!’

If it was Grade B+, it was in the realm of a genius.

Even though Isaac’s own potential and abilities were limited, my future
growth rate would be interesting to watch.

Following that, I practiced my magic and headed to the physical training
room.

The students from the Knight Department greeted me as if they had been
awaiting my arrival. And then all hell broke loose.

━━━━━「₪」━━━━━

The next day.

I met Amy while I was walking down the street. I was nervous about what
I would hear for a moment, but unexpectedly, she greeted me with a wide
smile.

\[Amy Holloway\] Psychology: \[Feels friendly towards you.\]

She appeared to be very happy. She said Ian came to her yesterday and
hugged her tightly and said he was ‘worried’.

Embarrassed by the sudden hug, she asked why, and Ian replied that he
was ‘worried that something happened because he didn’t see her today’.

He must have stuttered quite a bit. But Amy was in such a good mood that
she just let it go.

Besides, she must have been happy that the color of Ian’s heart had
brightened again.

‘So Amy’s on the lover’s route.’

If you rescued the kidnapped Amy during the ‘Childhood Friend Kidnapping
Case’, you would have two choices. \[Pat the shoulder\] and \[Hug\]. If
you selected \[Hug\], you would follow Amy’s lover’s route.

***Congratulations, Amy. Your wedding will be really touching.***

And, judging by the fact that she didn’t mention anything about Ian
being injured, it appeared that he had been healed immediately by Kaya’s
healing magic. To avoid worrying Amy, he must have gone to the dormitory
and changed his clothes.

He didn’t seem to have told Amy about his confrontation with Mateo, let
alone about me.

If I thought about how he didn’t show much of a reaction to me in the
classroom earlier, it seemed that Kaya and Mateo had agreed to keep
quiet about me.

***That’s highly commendable, Kaya.***

“What’s with this earring? Did you buy a new one? It suits you well.”

It wasn’t until I finished talking about Ian that Amy noticed the
Abyssal Ring on my right earlobe.

I had to wear it for a week, but I was glad that it looked good on me.

Following that, Mateo called me. To be more specific, the entire gang,
including myself, was summoned.

After being hit by Kaya’s wind magic, Mateo’s subordinates had no memory
of the previous events. It was all due to them losing consciousness.
When they awoke to find the abandoned warehouse completely destroyed,
they assumed it was all Kaya’s fault. Mateo must have affirmed their
assumption.

As soon as they woke up, they supported Mateo and headed to the
hospital. There, Mateo received professional healing magic and was
finally able to move.

Of course, he was not completely healed. Mateo had bandages wrapped
around his arms and torso. He appeared to be in pain, seeing as he
flinched every time he moved his arm, but he seemed able to move his
body without much trouble.

At an alley behind the academy building, Mateo bowed his head and
apologized to us.

“I’m sorry. From now on, I am going to live honestly and compete with my
skills. Thank you for going along with my orders. In the future, I just
want all of you to be my friends.”

The subordinates patted Mateo on the shoulder without saying anything,
as if they thought he had been subdued by Kaya.

Although there were twists and turns, things progressed similarly to the
story. I was greatly relieved.

\[Mateo Jordana\] Psychology: \[Feels grateful to you.\]

You feel grateful, huh child.

Mateo sent out all his other men, leaving us alone.

We went to the garden, sat under a tree, and started drinking. Of
course, he was the one who bought it. ‘Cause I didn’t even have a penny.

“All… I watched everything. The scene of you defeating the demon…”

***Why are you talking so respectfully?***

“You were pretending to be weak on purpose…”

“Just speak normally. It’s awkward.”

“How dare I…”

I wasn’t sure what Kaya said, but Mateo seemed to have succumbed to her
misunderstanding.

“I’ll get angry if you don’t.”

“Ah, I got it…”

Mateo reluctantly spoke informally again.

Kaya had a habit of using respectful words with everyone, so I didn’t
say anything, but it was awkward when a guy who had always spoken
informally suddenly used honorifics, it was difficult for me to bear.

“Thank you… Without you, I would have died there. Not just me, but the
guys I just sent there too.”

“Think of it as the payment for the meals.”

“I guess my life costs as much as food.”

Mateo burst out laughing, as if dumbfounded.

He was always serious, so when he smiled, it felt awkward.

To that extent, he seemed to think that the balance payment was
excessively unbalanced.

“…I apologized to Ian.”

“Is that so?”

“I understood after talking to him. I was on the wrong track. Just as
the nobles looked down on the commoners, I, a commoner, was also
treating them harshly. I thought that was the way to resist the nobles…”

I wasn’t interested in whatever realizations Mateo had. When he heard
Ian’s main character philosophy or beliefs, and reflected on himself, it
was obvious that he was talking about something like that.

Once I knew things were going well, my mind was full of plans for the
next one.

‘Now’s the problem.’

「Act 2, Chapter 3, Practical Training」, and 「Act 2, Chapter 4, Ant
Legion」.

I was already planning how to deal with the ant demon ‘Garzia the
Hermit’, who appeared in Act 2, Chapter 4.

Garzia the Hermit was level 140, and his ant army had excellent
collective intelligence and presents a carcinogenic evil element.

There was a reason why the already difficult Hell difficulty was rapidly
increasing.

It was because, as soon as he manifested, he stored up his strength in
the ‘Tantak Underground Cave’ in the academy grounds.

Then, two weeks later, with a full power-up, he showed up in front of
Ian in the middle of the practical training.

After completing Act 2, Scene 4, you could explore the underground cave
of Tantak.

Zephrim’, a rare mana remnant, could be found there. It was simple to
carry because it had solidified into a magic stone.

Zephrim was created as a result of Garzia repeatedly discharging and
rebuilding mana while accumulating power. It was primarily used for
accessory or weapon forging and was very profitable.

In other words, my strategy was to enter Tantak Cave first, defeat
Garzia the Hermit, who was hoarding strength, and collect Zephrim.

I wasn’t sure if it would work out. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it was
impossible to explore the Tantak underground cave ahead of time. It was
uncharted territory.

‘But, what if it works out?’

I could prevent a bad ending in advance, and avoid being a beggar.

It was just a brief escape at most. All I would have was a lot of gels.

Just imagining it made me feel good. Feeling confident that I would win
the lottery, I thought about what to do with my earnings.

“…So I’m going to see what Ian does in the future.”

***This bastard hasn’t finished talking yet.***

━━━━━「₪」━━━━━

Inside Class A’s classroom.

Even in class, Kaya Astrean couldn’t stop thinking about Isaac.

Throughout the day, she had been experiencing an overwhelming sensation
of excitement.

Earlier, while hiding behind a tree, she secretly overheard the
conversation between Isaac and Mateo, so she was becoming even more
addicted to the Isaac Drug.

How many achievements had Isaac made in this disturbance alone?

He joined Mateo’s gang and saved Amy Holloway from being in danger.

He defeated the dangerous demon.

He even reformed Mateo.

After all, a person who reached the realm of an Archwizard was truly
amazing.

As a prospective wizard, he was a person she couldn’t help but admire.

‘How can you be so amazing, Sir Isaac…’

Isaac was a very different person from Kaya, who could only study or
train magic.

The fact that they were classmates of the same generation, the same
academy, the same department, and peers excited her.

As Isaac had asked her to do the day before, Kaya properly informed
Mateo.

***Isaac is a man who has reached the realm of an Archwizard, and he is
pretending to be weak because he has a meaning deeper than the abyss and
broader than the open sea.***

At that time, right after defeating the demon, she was so engrossed in
the Isaac Drug that she over-expressed it a bit.

She instructed him to keep the appearance of the demon a secret and to
take it with him to the grave. Everything had a purpose. In fact, Isaac
had to have a deep and profound meaning for everything since he was in
such a position to protect the students.

She warned him not to say anything about Isaac, and that if he did, he
would not be let go.

She faked a story and told Ian that she and Mateo worked together to
catch the demon somehow. Amy was safe, so she intervened to keep this
matter a secret.

By the way, did Ian Fairytale have the body of a human? It was hard to
believe that he was healed with nothing but Kaya’s own healing magic.

Of course, depending on their constitution, some people have exceptional
resilience. It’s also possible that he managed to avoid the demon’s
attack. Kaya decided not to think too hard about it.

‘But as an ordinary person, you would only see a demon once in a
lifetime…. It’s a bit strange that so many of them appeared in such a
short period of time.’

Since arriving at the academy, she had encountered demons twice. If the
rumor about a demon appearing during the class placement evaluation was
true, that meant the demons had already appeared three times in Märchen
Academy.

The demons appeared so rarely that they were regarded simply as a
natural disaster.

The fact that they appeared at the academy so frequently was a very
strange thing.

And whenever the demons appeared, Isaac defeated them…

‘The reason Isaac came to this academy… is it related to the demons?’

Was there some huge secret hidden in the Märchen Academy?

***Isaac is a genius among geniuses who has reached the realm of an
Archwizard, so isn’t it because he already knew the secret that he
infiltrated this academy…?***

“…”

It was a terrifying thought. In other words, didn’t that mean that there
was a great danger lurking in the academy, to the point where an
important figure like Isaac had to step in?

***…Ah, no way.***

Kaya swallowed her saliva as the ridiculous thought ran through her
head.

Chapter 16: - Ant Cave (1)
==========================

༺ **Ant Cave (1)**༻

“It’s 2000 gels.”

I ended up taking a high-interest loan from the Academy Bank, with a
monthly interest rate of 5%, or 100 gels. The interest rate was vicious,
but it wasn’t fatal because the amount of the loan itself was small.

Typically, the loan screening criteria included an individual’s mana,
grades, and credit. Because my mana was only Grade E, my loan amount was
limited to 2000 gels, and I could only choose a loan product with a very
high-interest rate. Not to mention the fact that there was nothing to
use as collateral…

‘Isn’t it almost like an illegal loan shark?’

The institution that monopolized the financial sector under the academy
was so frightening.

Still, I believed it was an unavoidable choice.

Pride didn’t allow me to ask Mateo for food while condescendingly
saying, ‘I saved your life’.

But if my plan worked, I would be able to pay off my debt soon, and I
wouldn’t have to worry about my grades being penalized from taking out a
loan.

It was unclear whether the plan would work, so it felt like a gamble,
but…

Anyway, now was the time to eat well and get stronger.

“···Nice.”

During a dark evening.

In a deserted corner of the garden, the 4-star ice magic \[Frostfire\]
was engraved on a parchment. I had definitely memorized it by now.

\[Frostfire (★4)\] \[Obtainable!!\] Emits powerful cold air in the form
of flames.

**Type:** Active Skill (All-Purpose)

**Elements:** Ice

**Acquisition Conditions:**

– Lv 35 (O)

– \[Ice Generation\] Grade C- (O)

– \[Cold Divergence\] Grade C+ (O)

– Ice \[Elemental Firepower\] Grade C- (O)

– Ice \[Elemental Efficiency\] Grade C- (O)

**Trigger Conditions:**

– None

In order to use magic, you had to first memorize the shape of the magic
circle.

Magic, with the exception of a basic 1-star spell, did not simply
activate by pouring out mana into the air.

You had to use your mind to direct the flow of mana in the form of a
magic circle.

When the unique trait \[Hunter\] activated, I felt as if my body had
already mastered the magic circle, allowing me to use magic naturally.

With the body of the ordinary Isaac, I had to follow the standard
procedure.

I stretched out my right hand with my palm facing the sky and formed the
ice mana into the shape of a magic circle.

A light blue magic circle formed on the palm of my hand.

Above it, the faint cold and light blue mana took the form of a flame,
creating a \[Frostfire\].

“Ohhh…!”

\[You have learned the Ice Spell \[Frostfire (★4)\]!\]

***It’s done, it’s done!***

A cold, faintly burning mana flower. I could feel my mana constantly
being depleted.

I grabbed my right arm with my left hand after extending my hand with
the \[Frostfire\] outwards, then continued pouring mana in.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*────Whaaaaaaa──!*

The faint cold and light blue mana blazed forward like flames. Its range
was short, but that was to be expected due to my Grade D proficiency.

“Wow…”

***Is it because of the fact I finally had a worthy attack spell? My
mouth sprang open with an exclamation.***

I clenched my fists to extinguish the faintly blazing \[Frostfire\], and
closed my eyes tightly. My entire body trembled. I knew this feeling…
This overwhelming feeling.

It was a sense of accomplishment.

“Khehehe.”

There was still a long way to go.

‘Next up is \[Ice Wall\].’

\[Ice Wall (★4)\] \[Obtainable!!\] It creates a solid wall of Ice.

**Type:** Active Skill (Defensive)

**Elements:** Ice

**Acquisition Conditions:**

– Lv 30 (O)

– \[Ice Generation\] Grade C- (O)

– \[Cold Divergence\] Grade C (O)

– Ice \[Elemental Firepower\] Grade C- (O)

– Ice \[Elemental Efficiency\] Grade C- (O)

The sensation of using \[Ice Wall\] was ingrained into my body.

However, just a few days ago, I had difficulty using \[Ice Wall\]. It
took a lot of mana control to create a solid ice wall.

But now, it somehow seemed possible.

I closed my eyes and released ice mana, while imagining a wall forming
in front of me.

*Creak───*

As I moved my hand a little, I heard a sound as if something thick were
protruding from the ground.

And when I finally opened my eyes, my vision was blocked by a wall of
ice.

\[You have learned the Ice Spell \[Ice Wall (★4)\]!\] 「Ice Wall (Ice
Element, ★4)」

\[Ice Wall\]. It was a success! I finally got a proper defense!

As expected, after my \[Magic Training Efficiency\] became B+, I could
clearly feel my growth rate accelerate.

“Keuuuuuuuuu…!”

The difficult training moments passed like a panorama.

“Hahaha!”

A sense of accomplishment surged up like a volcano.

I raised my fist into the air with joy.

It was almost like Manny Pacquiao.^1^Translator Note: Emmanuel Dapidran
Pacquiao Sr. CLH is a Filipino politician and former professional boxer.
Nicknamed “PacMan”, he is regarded as one of the greatest professional
boxers of all time.

———————❖———————

「Act 2, Chapter 3, Practical Training」 would start one week and four
days from now.

Garzia, the ant demon, would begin to stockpile strength two weeks
before the Practical Training.

By now, Garzia should be nestled in Tantak Cave, and Zephrim, which were
created from the remnants of his mana, must have formed.

For reference, there weren’t many Zephrims I could get by visiting the
Tantak Underground Cave once Act 2, Chapter 4 ended. The reason for that
was because many Zephrim would lose their function as a result of mana
overload.

In other words, if I could go to Tantak Cave ahead of time, there was a
good chance I could get a lot of hot, high-quality Zephrim.

In other words, the current time was best.

It just so happened that tomorrow was a weekend. After I finished all of
my classes today, I would board a carriage and head to the Tantak Cave.

It would take 5 hours by carriage to get there, so after I defeat
Garzia, I guess I had to spend the night homeless.

I would rather leave tomorrow, settle things, and then return right
away, but it would be more efficient to set aside a day to invest in
stats and train.

‘Did I pack all my stuff?’

Inside Class D’s classroom.

The classroom was empty since all the students had left after the class
ended.

I sat in the middle seat, writing a list of luggage on parchment and
checking it off one by one.

Food like water and bread, as well as a portable light lamp.

Camping equipment such as simple tents and chairs, blankets, pillows,
and so on. I’ve got an extra just in case…

I also packed two magic pouches I had bought to store Zephrim. All of
them were purchased by emptying the gel that I had borrowed.

‘It’s perfect.’

No problem. I could start right away now.

The sky was gradually turning red. By the time I arrived at the Tantak
Cave, it would be dark.

I gathered my belongings, including the magic pouch, and proceeded to
the carriage stop to board one of the carriages.

There were no horses. Here, the ‘horse’ of the carriage was not a
‘literal horse’, but a ‘magic horse’.

Its shape was similar to the carriage I knew, but the carriage was
operated by the coachman’s mana. It moved if you infuse magic into the
handle.

I wasn’t sure what the exact principle behind it was, as it wasn’t
mentioned in the official setting. But since it was a game setting, I
would just move on.

“Where are you going?”

“The Tantak Cave.”

“Huh? If you go there right now… It’s going to be pretty late at night,
right? There are no accommodation facilities nearby. You know that,
right?”

“It’s all right, please go there.”

I got into the carriage and sat in a chair.

“Uhm, are you really okay…” muttered the coachman as he began driving
the carriage.

***You’re so worried even though I’m perfectly okay.***

“…”

The insides of the carriage squeaked as it moved.

In this case, it would be better to take a nap and relieve my fatigue.

I closed my eyes and fell asleep quietly.

———————❖———————

20 minutes before Isaac’s departure.

Class A had ended and Kaya had arrived at Class D’s door.

‘The Secret of Märchen Academy,’ a hideous conspiracy theory that
recently floated in her mind. She thought about how to get to the bottom
of this.

If there really was a dangerous secret lurking in the academy, it was a
matter of great concern not only for the students, but also for her own
safety.

She finally came to a decision. ‘Let’s follow Isaac’, who she believed
was her only lead.

For some reason, it seemed to be no different from her previous behavior
as she appeared to be stalking the person she admired.

But Kaya couldn’t help it, so she justified her action to herself.

From the classroom in which the students had departed. Kaya peered out
from behind the open door into the classroom.

In the middle seat, Isaac was alone. He appeared to be scribbling
something on a parchment.

***What is he doing? Study? No, I don’t think he’s studying…***

A question mark floated above Kaya’s head.

“Oh.”

When Isaac stood up, Kaya freaked out and bolted.

Just as she did, there happened to be a big box full of cleaning
supplies in the hallway. So she decided to hide in it.

She only poked her head out to the side of the cleaning kit. Isaac was
making his way out of the Class D classroom and down the hallway.

*Now let’s follow him like an assassin. Stealthily…*

Kaya followed Isaac in the shadows. *Swoosh,* her body hidden in place.

Isaac made his way to the carriage stop. Kaya, who was hiding behind the
tree with her head slightly poking up, tilted her head.

“A carriage?”

Isaac climbed into the carriage and began to depart.

The sky was a bright yellow. It was too late to take a carriage and
depart.

***Where is Isaac going at this hour?***

It was unusual.

***Should I go after him or not?***

After much thought, Kaya decided to go after him.

She quickly boarded the new carriage after arriving at the carriage
stop.

“Excuse me, guest. You have to tell me where you’re going first…”

“Please follow that carriage. Don’t let them notice us.”

The coachman tilted his head. Was it an issue between students?

Without further ado, he started driving the carriage. After all, he was
in a position where he only needed to get paid.

The sun was setting slowly in the sky.

Chapter 17: - Ant Cave (2)
==========================

༺ **Ant Cave (2)**༻

It was late at night.

When I got off the carriage, the sight of a gorge entered my eyes. It
was dark, with only the moonlight shining through, but even then, it was
a magnificent sight that was difficult to believe, given that it was
only four hours away from the academy.

The entrance to Tantak Cave was right in front of me. It appeared to be
a typical cave entrance, but once you entered, a pitch-black path
leading downhill would appear.

“Student, will you really be okay?” The coachman inquired, his voice
worried.

***Really, I’m okay…*** Even so, I couldn’t be rude to someone who was
worried about me.

With a light smile, I nodded, “It’s all right. Get home safe.”

“Students are…”

After receiving the payment I had given him, the coachman began driving
the carriage back.

Before I knew it, I had arrived. After taking a deep breath, I entered
the cave entrance.

***…It’s really dark.***

I took out a luminescent lamp from my magic pouch. The handy portable
lamp radiated light which helped illuminate the surrounding landscape.

\[Portable Luminous Lamp\] A lamp containing glowstone. It is convenient
to carry.

Rank: Tier 9

*Flapping–!*

“Uwak!”

As I shone the luminous lamp at the ceiling, the hanging bats flailed
their wings all at once from the light.

***My heart felt like it was going to burst…***

***I’m not good with scary things…***

“Ha, I’m so scared…”

Putting my hand on my chest, I took a deep breath.

Even if I had arrived during the day, it would have been dark. I
shouldn’t be regretful for coming here at this time; it was my choice
after all…

Anyway, it wouldn’t always be dark and scary. If I went in deeper, there
would be glowstones made from Garzia’s mana to mark the way.

***Let’s hold out until then. After all, it’s not like there are any
ghosts.***

I slowly moved forward.

“…”

As I walked, a downhill road appeared. It was a gentle slope. If I went
all the way down from here, I would arrive at an underground labyrinth.

I had everything about the underground labyrinth memorized by heart,
this much was only natural as I was a veteran ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱
player.

Just to be sure that I didn’t slip and fall, I began to carefully
descend downhill.

“…”

***Ah, but really…***

***It’s so scary when it’s dark.***

The illumination lamp had a limited-range. Beyond that range, it was
pitch-black darkness.

Suddenly, I imagined the terrifyingly frightening face of a ghost
appearing from the darkness in my mind.

If that happened, I would undoubtedly pass out. Yes, I would pass out.

I swallowed my saliva. I moved my feet quietly and silently in the midst
of the tension that seemed like it would make my heart stop.

…It was then.

*──Gyaaa─!!*

*──Kwadaang───!!*

“………!!”

Behind me, an ear-piercing scream echoed, followed by the sound of
collapsing rock.

In an instant, my heart sank. I was on the verge of passing out, but I
managed to keep my composure.

It was just a woman’s scream. It couldn’t be a ghost…

I turned around and began running uphill toward the cave’s entrance.

“…?”

After climbing all the way uphill, I saw broken stones all around the
cave’s entrance.

Then, as I shone the luminescent lamp in front of me, a familiar figure
of a female student sitting in the middle of the cave came into view.

The female student with light green pigtails, dressed in the same
Märchen Academy uniform as mine, was trembling.

She looked at me, then turned her head to the side, wiping away her
tears.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 91

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Ashamed to show you such an embarrassing sight.\]

***Why is Kaya here…?***

“Kaya…?”

“Ah, Sir Isaac. I mean, I…”

*Anyway, she’s the one who just screamed, right?*

Or did Garzia’s henchman show up?

I dashed over to Kaya, knelt down on one knee, and looked her in the
eyes.

“What startled you so much?”

“…”

“Maybe you ran into a giant ant…”

“Ba, bat…”

“Huh?”

“Because of the bats… I was scared…”

*…I see.*

“I’m sorry…”

Kaya apologized in a dejected tone. But it wasn’t necessary to
apologize.

Anyway, as long as it wasn’t a dangerous problem, it was fine.

“It’s okay. But why did you follow me?”

“…!”

***Why is Kaya here?*** Seeing that she appeared at this time, it seemed
she was following me. And her startled reaction made it obvious.

‘Why?’

I was aware of her admiration for me, but was Kaya the type of person
who stalked the person she admired?

“I, too, have a reason for being here…”

“You came after me.”

“Ugh, that’s… I can’t tell you why.”

Maybe I was seeing a side of Kaya I hadn’t seen before. If that was the
reason she didn’t want to talk about it, it was okay. I didn’t intend to
force her to speak right away.

“Can you get up?”

“…”

“…?”

When I reached out my hand, Kaya, who was hiding her expression the
entire time, suddenly looked at me blankly.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Feels that your sociable attitude is
awkward.\]

Oh right. I had been treating Kaya with a cold attitude, deliberately
pretending to be strong, and acting as if I had shown my true colors.

First of all, I was in a situation where I couldn’t reveal my actual
identity to Kaya. It was because I was afraid of the consequences if she
had discovered that I was actually weak.

It was necessary to maintain the usual ‘strong but revealing attitude’
so as not to raise unnecessary doubts.

“Hah,” I sighed.

“You didn’t come to disturb me, did you?” I inquired in a cynical tone.

Only then did Kaya relax her suspicious expression and looked at me with
a mix of admiration and fear.

“Ah, no…! No way!”

Kaya jumped to her feet and stood immediately as though her body fully
recalled her father’s military discipline.

I ignored her and started walking downhill again. Kaya chased after me.

“By the way, Sir Isaac, why are you here…?”

I didn’t have to hide my purpose, so I decided to answer honestly, “To
defeat a demon.”

“Is that so!” Kaya responded as if she had suspected as much.

“So there was a demon here…”

“You should not have come to this place.”

Kaya would be in danger if she stayed here. Garzia, even while not being
at full strength, was at a higher level than Kaya.

“No, I will help too.”

Kaya came to my side and she looked at me with a determined expression.

“To protect the academy.”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Feels that it is cool to protect the
peace of the academy.\]

***What are you imagining…?***

I wasn’t sure what it was, but I could tell she had a vivid imagination.

***She ventures into the darkness behind the academy and defeats the
forces of evil in order to protect the students.***

I wondered if she was imagining something like this. On second thought,
it might not be bad to have Kaya here.

Beyond the downhill road in this darkness was uncharted territory. In
other words, I was unable to deal with all variables.

In addition, Kaya’s abilities were also exceptional. Even if unforeseen
circumstances were to arise, she had the ability to cover my back.

If Garzia attacked, I would simply have to defend her.

“…Do as you please,” I replied with a feeling of reluctant acceptance.

Kaya’s face lit up. She nodded and returned her gaze forward.

Kaya took out a wand encrusted with a green magic stone and went on high
alert. She seemed reliable.

We walked downhill for 20 minutes, relying on the light from the
luminescent lamp.

Beyond the downhill path came the dim passage. It was the entrance to
the ‘underground labyrinth’.

“Where are we?”

“An underground labyrinth. It’s easy to get lost, so follow me closely.”

“Oh, yes…!”

I hurried my steps right away as Kaya followed me.

As soon as we entered the underground labyrinth, light brown glowstones
arranged in an orderly fashion on the walls came into view. They were
created using Garzia’s rock magic to easily distinguish the path.

This made it possible to discern the surroundings without the use of a
luminous lamp.

I placed a cloth over the luminous lamp and placed it in the magic
pouch.

I held my breath and walked through the maze. Whenever we had to decide
which direction to take, before Kaya could hesitate, I quickly picked a
path and moved on.

After all, the structure was no different from when I played ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

I could easily reach the center.

“Sir Isaac.”

Kaya abruptly stopped and called my name.

“I’ve been feeling this way since earlier, but how do you know the path
so well?”

“…”

…Huh?

***Wait a minute.***

‘Am I being suspected right now?’

I glanced at Kaya and opened her status window.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Feels doubtful if you have a
background where you were once part of the demons and then decided to
fight against the demons.\]

***What kind of scenario was this again…?***

Because of her rich imagination, Kaya comes up with bizarre ideas all
the time. This could quickly result in a difficult-to-manage situation.

It had to be answered unequivocally.

***What should I say? Well…***

***Oh, let’s make it up like this.***

“I’m just sensing the demon’s mana and finding a way. I’ve felt the mana
since the beginning, ever since I was at the academy.”

I said that, but it was really just nonsense.

How could someone sense mana from this underground cave all the way at
the academy? In the first place, the range mana could be sensed was so
damn small. It was a very silly thing.

However, as expected, Kaya seemed to believe it.

“Wow…”

She appeared surprised.

“I couldn’t sense anything… Is this the mana perception of an
Archwizard?” Kaya exclaimed in awe, her mouth wide open.

As expected, she was too simple-minded.

“You’ll be able to feel it gradually.”

Kaya and I started moving again.

She looked at me for a while with a twinkling gaze.

***Ah, those glistening eyes. It’s so dazzling, like starlight, so it’s
very daunting.***

─ It was then.

*Sakaksakaksakak…*

The sound of something sharp scratching, rocks being flung, and antennae
rubbing against each other.

Kaya and I both came to a halt and looked ahead.

*Sakaksakaksakak…*

Garzia had a lot of minions, also known as ‘Disaster Ants’ – one of the
factors that dramatically increased the difficulty of Act 2, Chapter 4.

*Sakaksakaksakak…*

Disaster Ants have excellent collective intelligence; a cancer to play
against that forced the player with all kinds of strategies and tactics.
When I first played Hell difficulty, I had a hard time because of them.

If Garzia was hiding here, it was only natural that a legion of Disaster
Ants were guarding this labyrinth. In this underground cave, there could
be up to 300 of them.

*Sakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksakak───*

In front of me, through the darkness, a large insect jumped out.

Scuttling with its antennae flickering, a large black ant appeared while
closing and opening its sharp pincers at the front of its mouth
repeatedly. Its wide-open eyes emanated a red glow – it was a Disaster
Ant.

\[Disaster Ant\] **Lv:** 70

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Rock

**Danger:** Upper-Intermediate

**Psychology:** \[Wants to kill you, the intruder.\]

“What is that?” Kaya asked, startled by the giant insect.

Fortunately, there was only one Disaster Ant in front of us. He appeared
to be patrolling the area.

It was dangerous when Disaster Ants flocked together. I wasn’t sure what
kind of strategy they would use to put pressure on me, despite the fact
that I was a demon-limited hunter.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

Then, there was only one way.

As I took a step forward, I extended my hand to Kaya and poured out my
mana.

A thin curtain was draped around her. It was a translucent film of ice
with beautiful ice crystals floating around it.

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★6)」

“Isaac, what are you going to do…?”

*Sakaksakaksakaksakaksakaksa──!*

The Disaster Ant took off quickly, running on all six of its legs. At
the same time, I bent one knee and placed my right hand on the floor.

“Freeze the entire labyrinth.”

And then.

I released my ice mana.

─────「Frost Wave (Ice Element, 6 ★)

*Charakkkkkkk————!!!*

The massive flow of cold air from my hands engulfed the entire
underground labyrinth in an instant, thoroughly freezing the Disaster
Ants and turning them into ice statues.

In an instant, the entire cave was transformed into a cold ice cave, as
if it had always been like that.

“Hah.”

A cold chill escaped my lungs.

If there was a legion of ants with excellent collective intelligence,
all I had to do was freeze them all before they could launch their
tactics.

<span id="0017_18_-_Ant_Cave_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 18: - Ant Cave (3)
==========================

༺ **Ant Cave (3)**༻

“Th-that’s amazing…”

I heard Kaya’s admiring voice from next to me.

The trait \[Hunter\] was active, making my current level 136. With each
skill’s proficiency at S-class, Kaya couldn’t be compared to me.

I released the \[Ice Barrier\] that was protecting Kaya.

“You’re amazing, Sir Isaac…!”

“Let’s go.”

I started walking forward, unbothered. At the same time, the unique
trait \[Hunter\] was deactivated, and my body became heavy. My body had
reverted to its original form.

When viewed up close, the frozen Disaster Ants appeared even more
menacing. Seriously, it looked disgusting.

Kaya followed behind me. Even on the icy floor, she walked smoothly.

If I unfroze the Disaster Ants I just met, they would die, but the ones
further away would remain frozen. In other words, I couldn’t recklessly
unfreeze the frozen cave.

“Haaa…”

I turned to face Kaya as soon as I heard her breathing.

She pretended to be fine with her arms crossed, but she seemed to be
feeling cold.

The cold that pervaded the underground labyrinth came from my magic.
Spellcasters aren’t affected much by their own magic, so I hardly felt
cold.

‘I should have paid attention.’

I was only thinking about myself.

I took out one of the magic pouches from my bag and reached in for
outerwear.

Then I stopped walking, took it out, and handed it to Kaya. It was a
school uniform cardigan.

“Take it.”

“No, I’m fine…”

***You look cold at a glance, so why are you refusing?***

I draped the cardigan loosely over Kaya’s shoulders and moved my feet
again. She clutched the cardigan and followed behind me, her head bowed.

“…Thank you.”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Feels burdened and grateful that you
gave her the outerwear.\]

As I made my way through the underground labyrinth, I came across
Disaster Ants that had turned into ice statues. It was a terrible fate
for the demons who were unprepared for the sudden icy disaster.

There were no traps to be found while traversing the labyrinth. Even if
there were, they would have frozen and ceased to function.

I was moving without a hitch.

*Thump-*

“…?”

It was small, but clearly audible; the sound of a heart beating.

*Thump, thump, thump-*

We would soon arrive at the end of the underground labyrinth. From the
other side of the labyrinth, the sound of a heartbeat could be heard.

Kaya’s eyes narrowed, showing her wariness. Her reaction alone told me
what she was going to say.

“I can feel it, this nasty mana… Is there a demon in front of us?”

I didn’t feel any unpleasant mana because my mana perception was so low,
but I nodded.

There was no point in being tired trying to feel the mana.

However, just hearing this heartbeat gave me the feeling that something
terrifying was up ahead.

*Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump…*

Finally, as I walked out of the underground labyrinth, a high ceiling
and a wide space spread out before my eyes.

Because of my magic, this place had transformed into an ice cave and the
ant legion, which was standing in order, was frozen solid.

At the end of the path where they were arranged in rows like trees,
there was a very large heart, a golden heart, which beat at regular
intervals.

The black gum-like exterior moved with the heartbeat, and the blood
vessels leading from the heart to various places in the cave radiated a
harmonious color of gold and black.

*Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump—*

“W-what is that…?”

Kaya appeared to be stunned by the magnificent sight.

“A demon,” I answered simply.

Inside the huge golden heart, the silhouette of a hideous creature
glowed.

It was easy to infer what it looked like just by looking at its
silhouette.

\[Garzia the Hermit\] **Lv:** 110

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Rock

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to kill you, the intruder.\]

In Act 2, Chapter 4 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Garzia was level 140.
He had been raising his level in this manner.

Even though the entire cave was frozen with \[Frost Wave\], he looked
fine, it seemed to have high elemental resistance.

It must be because I used magic from afar.

‘Is that Zephrim?’

Garzia’s mana remnants were transformed into the magic stone called
Zephrim, and it was nestled in every corner of the cave. My magic had
frozen it, but the pale yellow light that was unique to Zephrim was
clearly visible.

***Perfect.***

Now, the only thing left to do was kill Garzia in one swift motion.

*Dre-re-re-re-re-re-rek──!*

As expected, he wouldn’t stand still.

Around the golden heart where he was hiding, a massive wall of rock
erupted from the ground and enclosed it. The rock wall was a pearly
black color.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Rock (Rock Element, ★5)」

= 「Indestructible Iron Body (Rock Element)」

A black, iron-like rock surrounded the heart and blood vessels. It was
as solid and impenetrable as a castle wall.

A showdown between an unstoppable spear and an impenetrable shield. The
only option was to accept the challenge.

“Isaac?”

I headed towards Garzia’s heart.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\] 「Cold
Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

In order to increase the magic output, I began sending a hazy cold air
through my entire body. The cold air seeped out like a haze.

Like opening a window in a stuffy room to let in fresh air, I felt like
I could increase my ice mana output even more smoothly.

\[Garzia the Hermit\] **Psychology:** \[Wants to defeat you with a
\[Rock Burial\].\]

*Kududududududududu—–!!*

Crushing the ice that froze the surrounding area from the ground,
pillars of rock flew in from both sides.

「Rock Burial (Rock Element, ★4)」

Towering rock pillars oppressively covered the air, trying to crush me.

“Sir Isaac!”

I heard Kaya’s worried cry. It was alright, I could withstand this much.

As soon as I heard the sound of the \[Rock Burial\] being activated, I
lightly waved my index finger wrapped in mana.

With a flick of my finger, thick walls of ice rose from the ground to
the ceiling on both sides.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Kuwuwuwoong—–!!!*

…And the rock and ice collided.

The boulder created with \[Rock Burial\] couldn’t pierce the \[Ice
Wall\] that I made.

I strode along the narrow path made by \[Ice Wall\] until I arrived in
front of the heart.

*Thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—!*

The huge heart was floating high up in the air. It was truly a
magnificent sight. As I looked up at it, my neck began to hurt.

Garzia’s heart began to beat more fiercely, perhaps from anger.

My ears started to hurt.

I stretched out my right hand toward the heart wrapped in a
sturdy-looking \[Indestructible Iron Body\].

In this situation, I needed to use my most powerful short-range magic.

I condensed the mana in my right hand. I engraved the spells \[Frost
Explosion\] and \[Black Ice\] in my mind.

A light blue magic circle appeared in front of my right hand, and a
black magic circle appeared behind it, overlapping it. A dark blue
\[Frost Explosion\] magic circle was formed in this manner.

Then, the extremely condensed mana exploded into my hand.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」+ 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Frost Explosion (Ice Element)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

The black ice exploded and attacked the giant heart. The blackish-blue
cold air raged as the dark ice crystals and my white hair fluttered in
the wind.

A direct hit. In an instant, the heart was engulfed by the ice that
suddenly erupted and appeared ready to devour everything.

However—

*Thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—, thump—.*

Inside the black ice mass…

…The heart was still beating. The \[Indestructible Iron Body\] could not
be pierced.

*Drrrrrrrrrrrrr─*

Following that, the sound of rocks moving within the ice was heard. It
was clear that mana was flowing to repair the \[Indestructible Iron
Body\].

When the ice exploded, the \[Frost Explosion\] unleashed tremendous
power. In addition, \[Black Ice\], which increased the power of magic,
was applied, so the magic I cast now was my maximum power.

In other words, my spear failed to penetrate the shield.

***The level difference is in my favor, but that means…***

Garzia, who was gathering strength in the form of a heart, seemed to
have defense magic proficiency and elemental resistance far beyond his
level.

It was as if killing Garzia beforehand wasn’t allowed.

I felt the will of something like Providence.

‘What should I do…’

***Should I use the \[Black Frost Explosion\] again? No, it would be
foolish to do so without a plan. Even if \[Hunter\] is activated, using
\[Black Ice\] and \[Frost Explosion\] consumes a lot of mana.***

Not to mention, it didn’t take much time for Garzia to repair the
\[Indestructible Iron Body\] after being hit by my magic. The sound
alone was sufficient for me to grasp.

In other words, if he continued to repair \[Indestructible Iron Body\]
while I fired \[Black Frost Explosion\], I would be at a disadvantage.

But, if I increased the power a little more, my magic would be able to
reach him directly.

And the way to deliver the strongest possible blow…

“That ice…?”

***…is here.***

“Kaya.”

“Huh?”

I turned to face Kaya.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there was definitely a joint attack
system. A joint attack could effectively demonstrate \[Elemental
Synergy\].

When \[Elemental Synergy\] was activated, the effect of my elemental
magic overlapping with another element would become stronger. As a
result, more powerful magic could be poured onto Garzia.

“How about you? Don’t you also want to have some fun?”

I recall Kaya’s psychology from before. She seemed to aspire to be
something akin to an Apostle of Justice, fighting the evils that
threatened the academy.

I pretended to be considerate by asking Kaya that casually.

And soon, Kaya’s face brightened up.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Delighted by the thought that she can
play an active role.\]

“Yes!”

Kaya flew towards me quickly, with light-green wind wrapped around her
body, and landed lightly next to me.

I stretched out my right arm toward the heart encased in a block of
black ice. Meanwhile, Kaya also stretched out her left arm and pointed
her wand toward the heart.

*Whooooo——!*

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

Kaya’s wind began to swirl around her. The rough and disorderly wind
blew fiercely and shook my hair, Kaya’s hair, and our clothes
indiscriminately, carrying with it a chill that emanated from me.

The wind element was characterized by the continuous generation of wind
to increase the power of subsequent wind spells.

She was creating wind to increase the power of the attack she was about
to unleash.

“Thank you for the opportunity, Sir Isaac! I also wanted to hit that
demon with my magic!”

“I see.”

Kaya seemed to think that I could easily defeat Garzia.

She must have thought that the magic from earlier was only at a level to
gauge his defense capabilities.

“Among the attack magic you can use right now, tell me which is the most
powerful.”

“It’s \[Gale Fang\].”

“Good.”

\[Gale Fang\] was a 5-star wind spell and if I could combine ice magic
with it…

‘…\[Frostfire\].’

I engraved the spells of \[Frostfire\] and \[Black Ice\] in my mind.
Then, in front of my right hand, a dark blue magic circle appeared,
stretching toward the heart.

Meanwhile, right next to me, a green magic circle formed and began to
slowly rotate in front of Kaya’s wand, which stretched toward the heart,
and behind her.

I released the ice block that was covering the heart. The block of ice
disintegrated into glowing dark blue powder and scattered, displaying
the heart wrapped in a sturdy \[Indestructible Iron Body\] intact.

“When I give you the order, you’ll shoot.”

“Yes!”

In the \[Hunter\] state, my \[Elemental Synergy\] was S-class. The joint
attack I unleash with Kaya should at least be twice as powerful as my
previous combination of \[Frost Explosion\] and \[Black Ice\].

Cold air and frost, pale blue ice mana, and black-dark mana were all
swirling together.

A cold, dark blue flame formed in front of my right hand, and it began
to burn.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」+ 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Winter Hellfire (Ice Element)」

As it was, I fired the cold flames.

“Now!”

At my cry, Kaya and I shot out the magic at the same time. The cold,
dark blue icy flames were surrounded by a sharp light green wind. The
wind drew a clear trajectory from both sides and rose obliquely toward
the heart.

*Whiiiiiieeee────!!*

A firestorm of cold air quickly erupted. As if it didn’t want to miss
its prey, the heart was engulfed in a vicious whirlwind

As if a pack of wolves rushed in and bit it, the strong wind that
swirled around the \[Frostfire\] hit the heart with a series of blows.

「Winter Hellfire (Ice Element)」 + 「Gale Fang (Wind Element, ★5)」

= 「Glacial Tempest of the Endless Night (Ice+Wind Element)」

*Chaaaaaaak─────!!!*

*Chaaaaaaak─────!!!*

*Hwarrrrr─────!*

*Kwaaaak─────!!*

Rock debris flew everywhere.

Amidst the billowing cold and raging gusts of wind, the \[Indestructible
Iron Body\] shattered and fell apart. A viscous pale yellow liquid
gushed out like a waterfall.

The heart’s blood vessels, which were guarded by the \[Indestructible
Iron Body\], were severed by the \[Glacial Tempest of the Endless
Night\].

The golden heart was consumed in cold flames and collapsed powerlessly
in front of Kaya.

*Kuwuwuwong─!!*

\[Kkiueueueu..\]

A strange whimpering sound was heard right in front of us. Kaya and I
lowered our heads and gazed at the source of the whimpering – a human
ant with huge horns on both sides of his head and razor-sharp claws in
front of his mouth.

Its body was full of sharp claws, a pale white skin, and a female-like
form armored in black. Just like an ant, there was a large pocket behind
the buttocks, like an ant’s belly.

Garzia the Hermit.

His golden eyes gleamed as he laid on the floor, glaring at us.

He was slightly smaller than what I had seen in game, but he was still
well over 4 meters tall. Our magic seemed to have pierced the
\[Indestructible Iron Body\] and ruthlessly rammed him, judging by the
green blood flowing all over his body.

It was a terrible sight.

“This is the demon…” Kaya furrowed her brows.

\[Garzia the Hermit\] **Psychology:** \[I want to kill you I want to
kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want
to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I
want to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill
you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you I want to
kill you I want to kill you I want to kill you. I want to kill you.\]

Fully formed, Garzia stood well over 4 meters tall and leads his
minions, the Disaster Ants, in an attack during the Academy’s practical
training. He was like a killing machine who aimed to kill many students,
which included Ian.

I approached Garzia and extended my right hand to him.

“It’s a pity that you couldn’t fulfill your ambition.”

I condensed mana into my right hand.

A light blue magic circle formed in front of my right hand.

\[Kkiueueueueueueueue…!!!\]

And the condensed cold mana exploded in an instant.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa───!!!*

The ice rushed toward Garzia.

A torrent of cold.

It was the finishing blow.

<span id="0018_19_-_Camping_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 19: - Camping (1)
=========================

༺**Camping (1)**༻

The casting of \[Frost Explosion\] was over.

Garzia was trapped inside a huge block of ice, covered in scars.

As the ice was released, the ice block disintegrated into a light blue
powder that scattered and vanished.

Soon after, Garzia’s body turned to gray powder and scattered futilely.

“Is it over?”

“It’s over.”

As soon as the enemy’s resurrection spell was neutralized, Kaya
immediately confirmed the outcome.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Garzia the Hermit (Lv
110)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 40!\]
\[You have gained an additional 8 bonus stat points!\]

Soon after, the \[Hunter\] trait was released, and my body suddenly
became heavy. It was a feeling I could never get used to.

*Thud-*

At that moment, one of the swords that Garzia was holding fell to the
ground. It was a dagger with a black sheath.

I immediately picked up the dagger.

\[You’ve acquired the loot \[Sheath of Disaster\]! \[Sheath of
Disaster\] If you engrave a magic circle with a spell and infuse it with
the required amount of mana for casting, the spell can be used at the
location of the sheath.

Limit: 5-star magic

Cooldown: 10 minutes

Rating: Tier 1

The ‘Sheath of Disaster’. It was an immensely helpful item that
significantly broadened my tactical options.

When using the spell engraved on the sheath, there was no consumption of
mana. That was because it was meant to be used after filling the
necessary mana beforehand.

The embedded blade was a disguise. It was just a normal dagger.

“Sir Isaac, what is that?”

“A weapon that the demon possessed. I will retrieve it.”

***This is mine now, hehe.***

Suppressing the urge to hum, I put the Sheath of Disaster into the magic
pouch.

“Now…”

Now that I’ve defeated Garzia the Hermit, the Disaster Ants should have
been destroyed as well. However, I had frozen them, leaving them unable
to move and entrapped in ice.

I reached out my hand and dispelled the ice that covered the entire
cave.

The ice that froze the cave disintegrated into blue powder and dispersed
like fireflies.

For a brief moment, this massive ice release looked like a fireworks
display. I could tell from Kaya’s exclamation that she also thought it
was a beautiful sight.

The Disaster Ants, who had been standing in order, quickly turned to
gray powder and vanished.

At that moment, a system window popped up in front of me.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated 300 \[Disaster Ants (Lv 70)\] and
gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 50!\] \[You have
unlocked the achievement ❰Genocide❱! You have gained an additional 10
bonus stat points!\]

“…”

***Whoa, no, whoa, hold on a second.***

When I defeated Garzia in Act 2, Chapter 4 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
all the Disaster Ants were destroyed as a result, but I received no EXP.

The only things that gave EXP were the Disaster Ants that you directly
defeated.

Even worse, the Disaster Ants didn’t come at you all at once, using a
wide variety of tactics to constantly put pressure on the player
instead. This made defeating all of them an impossible task.

However, while freezing the entire cave, I unknowingly touched the
entire Disaster Ant population, and it was judged that I had dealt with
all of the Disaster Ants.

As a result of this, an experience party was held, and I achieved the
\[Genocide\] achievement.

“Oh, ohh…!”

Just as I was about to scream at the surging sense of accomplishment, I
saw Kaya’s eyes. I coughed and came to my senses.

No, no, I shouldn’t. I could celebrate after I’ve parted ways with Kaya.
Until then, it was better to put this joy to rest.

***…Hahaha.***

“Sir Isaac?”

“Kaya, I have a favor to ask of you.”

“…! What is it?”

Kaya’s green eyes sparkled. Her eyes were full of expectations, as if
she were a curious child.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 93

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Delighted at the thought of doing you a favor.\]

***It’s nice to be happy, but isn’t that a slave mindset…?***

In any case, she gained co-op EXP and leveled up too.

Even though her level was in the 90s and had only increased by one, she
must have gained a lot of experience.

Kaya’s performance appeared to have been deemed excellent this time.

Well, I admit it, I was glad things worked out as well as they did. If
Kaya wasn’t here, I would have been in serious trouble.

Now there’s only one thing left to do.

“I’m going to retrieve that now,” I said, pointing to the pale yellow
magic stone, Zephrim, lying on the ground.

“Help me with that.”

***Honestly, you became stronger thanks to me, right? I can ask for this
much, can’t I?***

“All right!”

Kaya agreed willingly.

After I handed her one of the empty magic pouches, she moved to the
opposite corner of the cave and began collecting Zephrim.

Before long, she used powerful wind magic and gathered all the scattered
Zephrim into one place. Thanks to that, I was able to conveniently sweep
up all of the Zephrim.

“But what are all these magic stones?” She queried, while depositing
Zephrim into the magic pouch.

I didn’t feel the need to lie, so I answered truthfully, “A material
used for forging weapons.”

“Are you thinking of making a weapon?”

“No, I’m going to sell it. I’m collecting it to make money.”

Kaya nodded as if she understood.

“You were short on gel because you were pretending to be weak. If you
had told me, I would have helped you anytime.”

That’s too much of a request…

Kaya was the second seat of the 1st year’s Magic Department and the
daughter of the Duke Astrean.

For example, if a Grade E commoner like me were to be seen having a
friendly meal with her, I couldn’t even imagine the troublesome rumors
that would spread among the students.

“I do not need it,” I answered sternly.

———————❖———————

On the journey back. Kaya and I were climbing up the dark uphill road
after exiting the underground labyrinth, relying on the light of the
luminous lamp.

The magic bag, containing two magic pouches full of Zephrim, weighed
heavily on my shoulder. In addition, the Sheath of Disaster…

***Isn’t it too full\~***

“Sir Isaac.”

As we walked quietly, Kaya suddenly broke the silence.

“What was that black ice from before?”

As expected. I was wondering when she’d ask.

The \[Black Ice\] was a magic created by combining ice and darkness
elements. No one could say it was demon magic simply because it cast
black light, but in this situation, it was understandable to have
doubts.

If I evaded this question, there was a high chance that Kaya would
imagine something wild.

***Should I make something up and say it?***

But there was no need for that.

I decided to answer honestly.

“Did you use a magic tool to change the color or something?”

“It’s demon magic.”

“………!”

Kaya’s eyes widened.

*Whiiing-!*

Kaya immediately retreated to the other side, wind magic wrapped around
her feet.

Her tense face showed her alert posture.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Wonders if you are a demon.\]

***See, this is what happens.***

I came to a stop and said calmly, “…I defeated a demon in the past and
obtained an item.”

“Item?”

“‘Remnant of Darkness’. It’s a Tier-1 item that combines dark mana and
my elemental mana in order to allow me to learn new magic. That’s how I
can use Black Ice.”

The term ‘Tier’ referred to an item’s rarity. The lower the number, the
more rare and valuable it was, and ‘Tier-1’ was without a doubt the
highest grade.

***By the way, did my response sound too much like an explanation? It
may look like I am lying…***

“………”

Three seconds. Three eerily silent seconds had passed, as if time had
stopped.

Kaya lowered her gaze and nodded. She seemed to have arrived at her own
conclusion.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Trusts you.\]

I defeated a demon and showed Kaya. That alone demonstrated that I
wasn’t siding with the demons.

Perhaps Kaya thought similarly.

“I’m sorry for doubting you.”

Kaya relaxed her guard and returned to my side.

20 minutes later.

We emerged from Tantak Underground Cave. We were greeted by the starry
night sky and a view of the gorge, the nearby forest, and the unpaved
road.

Perhaps it was because our spirits were lifted, but the scenery appeared
especially beautiful.

“We finally made it… Thank you for your hard work, Sir Isaac.”

“Yeah.”

“But, how will we go back to the dormitory?”

“…………?”

“……………?”

***…Oh right. How was I planning to get back?***

“Are you going to camp?”

“……?”

***………?***

***No, seriously?***

It was an hour’s walk from here to the carriage stop. It was already
late, so the carriage service had to be over. Besides, there were no
accommodations around here.

In addition, there was a limit to how far Kaya could fly using her wind
magic.

It was the act of condensing enough wind to carry a person while
releasing it steadily and continuously. The amount of mana consumed was
unavoidably enormous if it wasn’t intended to be used for a short period
of time.

Even at Kaya’s level, it didn’t matter how much mana she had, she would
run out after flying for about three minutes.

“You, did you come here without any plans?” I said, while Kaya silently
lowered her head, her face beet red.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Embarrassed to show her clumsy
appearance.\]

***…That’s understandable.***

She never thought I was going to camp and followed me without a plan.

“…Follow me. I’ll take care of you.”

“Huh?”

Kaya’s face was filled with skepticism. It was as if a question mark had
appeared above her head.

———————❖———————

In the middle of the gorge.

I was lost in self-indulgence as the radiant crescent moon reflected my
appearance on the rippling stream.

The gorge kept the wind at bay, making it quiet, and the ground was
flat. In a nutshell, it was the perfect camping spot.

I took everything I needed for camping out of my magic pouch. First, I
unfolded the simple tent and installed it with ease. It looked
surprisingly comfortable with a blanket and luminous lamp placed inside.

Then, I pulled out two makeshift chairs. It was a good thing I had
brought some extras just in case.

Kaya just stood there blankly. She seemed amazed by my intention to
earnestly camp out.

“You came here with such a plan…”

Of course. I could catch a cold if I slept like that.

I did overspend, but I figured I could make a lot of money by selling
Zephrim anyway.

It turned out to be the best choice.

“Kaya, can you bring me some firewood?”

“Oh, are you going to start a campfire?”

I nodded.

“I’ll be back soon!”

Kaya wrapped herself in wind magic and flew into the forest over the
gorge.

If she had her wind magic, she would be able to create firewood easily.
Well, I did help her get stronger rapidly, and I decided to provide her
with camping equipment, so I guess it was okay to ask for that much.

I sat in a folding chair and placed a dimly lit luminous lamp in front
of me.

‘Let’s see.’

I took out the Sheath of Disaster from my magic pouch and started
examining it; there were fine scratches covering the black sheath. When
I stroked it, the smooth texture had a hint of roughness to it.

On the outside, it looked old and plain. Therefore, it was a good item
to catch opponents off guard.

*Shuk-*

I took out the dagger from its sheath and held it up.

A dagger with a moderately sharp edge. It really was just a normal
weapon. Still, the dagger itself had its own functions, so it could be
useful in many ways.

I put down the blade and turned my gaze back to the Sheath of Disaster.

I was going to engrave the \[Frost Explosion\] magic circle on this
sheath. Then I could use \[Frost Explosion\] without consuming any mana
if I had the Sheath of Disaster with me.

I wouldn’t have to release mana. I wouldn’t even have to pretend to use
magic. Wasn’t it suitable for catching the opponent off guard?

However, the cooldown was 10 minutes, and I would need to keep enough
mana in the sheath equal to the amount spent on \[Frost Explosion\] each
time I used it. I would most likely only use it once per battle, but
that single-use would give me the edge needed to win.

Of course, just engraving a magic circle and infusing it with mana
wasn’t enough. It had to be a spell I could use.

I reached level 50 today, so I should be able to learn \[Frost
Explosion\] soon. At the very least, I wanted to learn it before the PvP
Performance Evaluation.

“I’m back, Sir Isaac.”

Kaya had already arrived. Next to her, the firewood was spinning in a
little whirlwind.

***She’s really fast, she would do well as a soldier.***

***Come to think of it, life in the Astrean family mansion must be no
different than in an army.***

“Good job.”

“……………!”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Delighted to hear your praise.\]

***She looks like a puppy.***

…I felt embarrassed for no reason. Have I ever had this much influence
over someone? I couldn’t think of anything other than when I was a class
leader in elementary school.

Anyway, I now needed to light a fire.

I took out a fire magic scroll engraved with a magic circle from my
magic pouch and spread it out on the ground and fixed it with a rolling
stone.

I activated the magic scroll by infusing it with mana. The spell was
then activated, and a soft flame rose gently.

「Fire Generation (Fire Element, ★1)」

Elemental scrolls could only be obtained up to a maximum of 2-stars.
This was because there was a limit to the amount of mana that could be
stored in a magic scroll.

The 1-star fire magic scroll I got was also useful in real life.

Kaya released her wind magic and placed the firewood on top of the fire
magic scroll. Before long, the firewood caught fire and started burning…

…And the campfire was complete.

‘Oh.’

***Are you feeling okay?***

“Sit down,” I said to Kaya, who just stood there blankly, as I pointed
to the folding chair set up next to me.

“Yes, sir!”

The warmth of the bonfire was comforting, but the weather was still
cold.

I took out a blanket and wrapped myself in it before passing the extra
blanket to Kaya.

She thanked me and wrapped the blanket around her shoulders in the same
way I did.

Afterward, I heated water over the campfire and gave her a cup of warm
tea. Kaya must have been amused by the number of things I brought out,
as seen from the grin on her face.

“It’s warm…” Kaya’s expression softened, as if her body was melting.

*Crackle.*

The sound of a campfire burning was rampant.

We quietly watched the campfire while sipping the warm tea. The silence
wasn’t that uncomfortable.

‘It’s been a while since I’ve felt this relaxed…’

It was the first time I felt relaxed after being transmigrated into
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

It had been a month and a half since I transmigrated into this game, and
I was working hard to get stronger. I needed to be as strong as possible
in order to defeat the final boss, the Evil God Nephid.

Maybe that was why this moment of leisure felt awkward.

“…”

Suddenly, the life that had been passing by rose quietly, swaying like
smoke from a bonfire, like a haze.

It was a life that I tried hard not to regret. I ended up transmigrating
into this game, but I didn’t have any thoughts of giving up.

Because if I gave up now, then it would all be over. I had clearly felt
that already throughout my life while struggling through the exams that
would decide my future.

It was hard. Magic training, physical training, and then studying. Every
day, I pushed myself over and over again to the point where I felt like
24 hours a day wasn’t enough.

But it was okay once you got used to the hard times. Even now, I was
doing well in my routine.

…As expected, all sorts of thoughts surrounded my head as I was spending
time quietly.

However, it was fortunate that at this time, one of the people I had a
lot of affection for from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was right next to
me. It might be that thing called psychological comfort.

She must have finished her tea by now.

At the thought of giving her another cup of tea, I turned towards the
person I held dear to me.

“…?”

For some reason, Kaya had her head lowered and her face was beet red.
Above her head, smoke seemed to be rising like a hot spring mark.

Could it be that she caught a cold because of the chill in the cave
earlier? Even then, she seemed embarrassed to admit she was feeling
cold.

To check if she was suffering from a poor physical condition, I opened
her status window to understand her psychology.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Extremely nervous at the thought of
being with you.\]

I was a fool for worrying.

<span id="0019_20_-_Camping_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 20: - Camping (2)
=========================

༺ **Camping (2)**༻

I could understand her.

Since childhood, Kaya grew up like a soldier under the protection of the
Sword Saint Gerald, and lived a life where she built a wall around
herself and men.

For her, being in a situation where she has to sleep in the same place
as a man must have been quite a psychological blow.

Besides, I wasn’t ugly. When I saw Isaac’s face in the mirror, he
appeared to be rather attractive. She even admired me.

The conditions were just right for something strange to happen.

I cast another glance at Kaya. She was still nervous.

She must have been afraid that I would touch her. In a good way, a bad
way, or both.

That didn’t mean I could sleep outside, I only had one tent.

Even if I made an igloo with ice magic, it was useless because I
wouldn’t be able to control my mana while asleep, and the spell would be
dispelled.

“………….”

“………….”

In the quiet night, the sound of a crackling campfire and a gently
flowing stream could be heard.

If I kept my mouth shut while listening to natural ASMR like this, the
strange atmosphere would only get worse.

Just then, my drowsiness kicked in, and I was starting to feel sleepy.

Perhaps in this situation, it would be a good way to reassure her in
this situation if I went to the tent’s corner and fell asleep first.

“I’m sleepy. Let’s sleep.”

“Ah, yes, yes!”

Private Kaya Astrean.

She reminded me of when I first joined the military and was assigned to
my own unit. I was a private.

I got up from the folding chair, with a blanket draped over my
shoulders. Then I entered the tent first, while ignoring Kaya, who was
staring at me.

There was enough room for the two of us. I went to the farthest corner,
and laid down there so Kaya could sleep comfortably.

‘Ah.’

***This cozy feeling, what is it? It’s nice.***

***It doesn’t feel like I’m just coming over and camping… It’s real
camping.***

“Excuse me…”

After some time had passed, Kaya cautiously came inside.

Every move she made was fraught with tension. Her blanket was slung over
her shoulders and tightly wrapped around her body.

I did not respond on purpose. I only squinted my eyes slightly before
closing them and pretended to be asleep.

Kaya went to the corner opposite of me and laid down. I could hear the
duvet and blanket rubbing against each other.

Suddenly, it was quiet.

***Will she be able to sleep well?***

I slowly opened my eyes and glanced in Kaya’s direction.

‘Oh my.’

*Tremble*

I wasn’t sure why, but Kaya’s body was shaking violently like a bell.
She stared at the empty tent ceiling, her blanket pulled up to her lips.

She was tightly sticking to the opposite corner, making the center of
the tent appear very empty.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Nervous at the thought of sleeping
alongside you, as if her heart is going to burst.\]

***I won’t touch you, so don’t worry…***

‘Well, she’ll fall asleep eventually.’

Thinking that, I closed my eyes again.

My whole body felt languid. It seemed that fatigue had piled up.

After finishing a full day of classes, I rode a carriage to Tantak Cave,
and killed Garzia the Hermit…

“Sir Isaac.”

Kaya suddenly called out to me.

“You said that you detected the demon’s mana residing in the underground
cave while at the academy. Did you know, by any chance, that I was
following you… or, even when I was around…?”

Of course, I didn’t know.

As I reflected on what she had just said, it seemed like this wasn’t the
first time Kaya has followed me.

In any case, Kaya following me for whatever reason wasn’t a situation
that I wanted to deal with.

It was because there was a great risk that my secret would be exposed if
she found out about my daily routine, where I was constantly training.

If that happened, I didn’t know what kind of aftermath would follow.
Unforeseen variables were a frightful factor in a position where I had
to be as cautious as possible.

“…Don’t do that again. It’s annoying,” I said calmly, clutching onto my
sleepy mind.

“Ah, I understand…!”

Kaya’s answer trembled like an earthquake.

That should be enough.

Letting go of the tension in my mind, I fell into a dream.

———————❖———————

It had been about three hours. I awoke from a dream in which I fell
asleep during a cold-weather military training. I was also dozing off
there.

I raised my upper body. It was too cold in the morning to be sleeping
with just one blanket.

Although I didn’t feel much cold from my own magic, I was no different
from a normal person when it came to the cold caused by the outside
environment.

“Ugh, it’s cold,” I grumbled as I turned to face Kaya.

I saw her lying with her back to me, covered by a blanket.

After draping the blanket over her, I pulled out a change of clothes
from my magic pouch. I was going to sleep with this on.

It couldn’t be helped. It was better for me to suffer the cold than for
her, who had followed me with a childish mind.

“Ah.”

The Sheath of Disaster that was in my extra clothes touched my hand. I
took out that item too.

Every time I saw it, I was filled with pride.

When I was young, I remembered getting one of the Egyptian God Cards,
Obelisk the Tormentor, in a Yu-Gi-Oh! pack and looking at it all day
long while being happy. I felt similar emotions as back then.

When I gently touched the Sheath of Disaster, a smile naturally formed
on my lips.

“Beautiful.”

***Hehe. I hope to use it well in the future.***

I put the Sheath of Disaster back into the magic pouch.

‘I have to sleep again.’

I covered my body with the extra clothes I had taken out and laid down.
As expected, it was cold.

I curled up and folded my arms, trying to retain as much body heat as
possible.

Luckily, sleep came easily.

———————❖———————

The first company wake up call.

*Beep beep beep beep beep beep!*

In my dream, I awoke to an alarm sound that I never wanted to hear
again. It was brief, but it felt like crap.

Surprisingly, I felt refreshed and well-rested. Perhaps because I slept
for so long.

I had been so busy with classes, training, and studying that I had to
sacrifice sleep time, so fatigue became a passive skill for me.

This refreshing feeling, it felt awkward.

As I yawned and lifted my upper body, the blanket that was covering my
body slid down.

“…?”

There was no sign of anyone beside me. When I turned my head, I couldn’t
see Kaya there. She seemed to have covered me with a blanket and then
left.

I opened the tent door. A cool morning breeze drove away any lingering
drowsiness I had, and soon the crackling of a campfire followed.

I peered through the tent door. The morning sun illuminated the gorge. I
could see the back of Kaya, who was sitting on a folding chair in front
of the campfire.

She wore the coat I gave her yesterday with a blanket draped over her
shoulders.

The charred firewood in front of her was most likely freshly cut this
morning.

I put on my shoes and walked out of the tent. Then.

“Huh!”

Kaya, who was startled for some reason, quickly turned her head toward
me.

***Why are you so surprised?***

“Ah, Sir Isaac. Are you awake…?”

Kaya smiled awkwardly, with dark circles under her eyes. Her skin was
white and fair, so it was particularly noticeable.

***It doesn’t seem like she slept properly.***

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[She feels relieved that you didn’t
touch her, but is skeptical of her charm as a woman.\]

***What am I supposed to do?***

———————❖———————

After about 30 minutes of walking, the carriage stop appeared.

Kaya and I boarded a carriage and set off. Perhaps because a male and
female student appeared out of nowhere, the coachman regarded us with
suspicion.

The carriage began its journey towards the academy.

Soon after, Kaya started nodding off as she rested her head against the
carriage window, falling asleep.

Her coat slid down, exposing her small shoulders. I lifted her coat and
wrapped it around her shoulders.

Her head swayed as the carriage swayed, which caused her head to land on
my shoulder. She was completely relaxed.

Thinking about it, I was uncertain what would have happened if Kaya
hadn’t been there. Originally, it wasn’t allowed in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ to go and defeat Garzia before he completely stockpiled his
power. To begin with, you couldn’t even enter Tantak Cave until the end
of Act 2, Chapter 4.

I completely deviated from the formula and explored previously unknown
segments of the game. As a result, perfect preparation was impossible.

However, thanks to Kaya, I was able to successfully pierce Garzia’s
\[Indestructible Iron Body\].

Moreover, I had no trouble collecting Zephrim. Firewood was also readily
available, avoiding the need for strenuous physical labor.

‘Thank you.’

***You helped out a lot. I’ll repay you someday.***

I leaned my head against the opposite window and gazed out. The morning
sun illuminated the leafy green trees.

The morning fog that had blanketed the forest was also dissipating.

And the sky was dyed in the purest blue light.

———————❖———————

About four hours later, the carriage arrived at the academy.

A sight of familiar buildings came into view. I even had the illusion
that I had returned home.

Kaya was still fast asleep. She seemed to be exhausted.

“Kaya, we’re here.”

I shook Kaya’s shoulder, trying to wake her up. As soon as I said those
words, she opened her eyes and sat up straight.

“Wake up!…… Ah.”

It was obviously an instinctive move. She lived her life pretending to
be gentle and meek, but in reality, her entire body was imbued with
military discipline.

“D-did we arrive?”

***Yes, we’ve arrived.***

Kaya got out of her carriage first, turned her head away from me, and
covered her mouth. She seemed to be secretly yawning.

I followed her and handed the payment to the coachman. He bowed lightly
and drove away.

‘She looks very tired.’

It would be best to send her home as soon as possible.

But there was something important I needed to say. I wasn’t sure if it
was necessary, but I didn’t want to leave it out.

“Kaya.”

“Yes, Sir Isaac!”

Kaya stiffened her movements as she turned her head towards me.

It was a tense situation.

In any case, it would be best to keep the defeat of Garzia a secret.

If Alice Carroll, the student body president, found out, it would be the
end of my life.

Fortunately, she didn’t know about the existence of Garzia, let alone an
item like the Sheath of Disaster.

Alice was just a shadowy figure trying to help the Evil God Nephid
manifest.

The Evil God Nephid wasn’t on her side.

“Keep yesterday’s incident a secret. It would be troublesome if others
find out, so don’t reveal it to anyone.”

“Ah, yes…”

Kaya’s voice crawled in like the sound of an ant’s chirp. Wasn’t it a
bit cute?

Her face was flushed red again.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Embarrassed and flattered about
having a secret between you and her.\]

***What is she mistaken about again…***

“I mean the demon.”

“Ah, the demon, of course, I was thinking about the demon…! I’ll keep it
a secret. I’m sure Sir Isaac must have a deep meaning. And also…”

Kaya raised her head and looked at me with a solemn expression.

“The reason why demons appear in the academy, the reason Sir Isaac
searches for and defeats the demons… Is there something in this academy
that I don’t know about?”

“…”

“…You don’t have to answer. Sir Isaac is an amazing person, so there
must be a good reason why you can’t tell me.”

The atmosphere became heavy. It might have been a good idea to use the
flow of the conversation to win Kaya over to my side.

The Evil God Nephid, the final boss, was the root of all evil. If I
could find a companion to share information about that guy, it would
certainly be great psychological support, especially if that companion
was Kaya.

But I didn’t want to put such shackles on Kaya.

The advent of a mighty being that could easily destroy the world. I
wondered what the difference was between that and a death sentence. It
was highly likely to put a heavy psychological burden on Kaya.

Anyway, I would keep defeating demons until I reached the Evil God
Nephid. I already devised a plan, and if all went well, Kaya would most
likely follow my words. There wasn’t much of a difference.

So it would be best if I did not respond to this.

“…Thank you, Sir Isaac. I will go in now.”

Kaya understood my silence as an answer and slightly bowed in farewell.

She took off the school uniform cardigan and gave it back to me, turned
around and walked away.

As I watched her leave, I fell into deep thought.

———————❖———————

Märchen Academy was spread across an entire island. So, under the
leadership of the academy, a small economy developed on this island, and
money circulated.

It meant that all sorts of places you would expect to find in a city
were here.

However, according to academy rules, academy students were not permitted
to sell items brought from outside. Students were only permitted to sell
items obtained legally on academy grounds.

Upon entering the academy, all students were bound by the ‘Marx Pact’.
It was an absolute oath governed by a providence created by ‘Archwizard
Marx’, and it was effective only on the grounds of Märchen Academy.
Failure to comply would result in a ‘forced expulsion,’ with one of the
suspension conditions being the sale of goods brought from outside.

It was also prohibited to create added value in the form of consignment
sales or subcontracting. I could feel a sense of determination from
Märchen Academy that said, ‘This is our land, so we will monopolize it’.

Zephrim was a mana stone obtained within the academy grounds, and was an
unowned object. I was relieved that I wasn’t going to break any rules.

As an aside, the Marx Pact covered more than just trading. For example,
it was strictly prohibited to bring in consumable items containing magic
from outside sources. This included things such as magic scrolls and
potions.

After parting ways with Kaya, I went to the appraisal center. Beyond a
glass case lined with miscellaneous items, a short old man greeted me.

“Whoa, what kind of young man are you…?”

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there were several appraisal centers and
among them, this one ran by Harrison was the most generous. The only
problem with it was that it wasn’t accessible at the beginning of the
game.

However, because I already knew about the Secret Shop, content that was
only available later in the game. I was sure that I could enter this
place as well. I wasn’t bound by the game’s story after all.

I couldn’t wait to see how much I would get for selling Zephrim here. I
was looking forward to it.

As a side note, there was an unwritten rule at the appraisal center that
they didn’t pry into anything unless it was illegal, regardless of who
brought it in.

Harrison, on the other hand, was a veteran with an open mind, so he
wouldn’t mind if I brought a bunch of Zephrim. He would probably just
think of me as a lucky young man.

I politely bowed and took out two magic pouches.

Although the magic pouch could reduce weight, it couldn’t be reduced to
zero. Therefore, the magic pouch containing Zephrim was quite heavy.

However, my body was now trained in a hell-like PT. Carrying a magic
pouch like this wasn’t easy… but it wasn’t enough to kill me.

I opened the magic pouch and took out the pale yellow magic stone,
Zephrim, and placed it on top of the glass case.

Harrison’s gaze shifted from me to the Zephrims.

“I’m here to get an appraisal.”

“Oh, this is…”

Harrison picked up one of the Zephrims and began examining it through a
magnifying glass.

“Let’s see, this is…”

Harrison began to move the Zephrim around.

I remembered Ian Fairytale getting frustrated with his slow movements in
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ but given his age, I decided to be patient
with him.

“Hmm, ho-oh-oh…”

His movements were very slow, but it was worth the wait.

“Mmmm… That’s right… No, mmmm…”

Somehow his movements were seriously slow, like a sloth, but it was
still tolerable.

“Geee… heheheh…”

…10 minutes passed like that.

But just before my patience was about to explode.

“When are you going to tell me…

“

“3000 gels.”

“What?”

“3000 gels for one of these will be enough… Off you go.”

My frustration disappeared like the melting snow.

I had brought a total of 56 Zephrims. I did some quick math.

That meant…

‘168000 gels…!!’

At that moment, my thoughts ceased.

Only one thought filled my head, bright and clear.

Tonight’s dinner was beef.

———————❖———————

“My lady, where on earth have you been all night…?”

Inside Charles Hall, the highest dormitory of Märchen Academy.

When Kaya saw Mary, the maid who had been waiting for her all night
worrying, she replied with a serious face.

“I have been protecting the peace of the academy.”

“……?”

Mary was puzzled, unsure of the meaning behind Kaya’s words.

After Kaya reassured Mary through a conversation and said she wanted to
rest by herself, she went into her room – a luxurious and spacious room,
incomparable to the small tent she slept in the night before.

But her consciousness was still inside the small tent.

“Demons…….”

She reflected upon the events of the day before.

Apparently, Isaac was aware that demons would appear at Märchen Academy
and enrolled.

To keep the peace at the academy, he must be killing demons. And she
must keep his identity a secret to not interfere with his actions.

Although Kaya was unsure of Isaac’s deeper meaning, she was certain that
following his words was the best way to protect the people at the
academy.

“…Sir Isaac.”

The memories of her time with Isaac from the day before were still vivid
in her mind.

His overwhelming appearance when he froze the entire cave, his kind
appearance when he covered her with his coat, and his cold-hearted
appearance as he unleashed his magic on the demon beside her.

All those memories flooded Kaya’s mind. If her mind was an ocean, those
memories were the seawater that filled it.

“He was cool…”

He was someone she admired.

But apart from that memory. He felt a little different than usual.

It was at dawn when he secretly covered her with a blanket.

Kaya, who had been pretending to be asleep with her mind in a daze, felt
embarrassment and a warm feeling in her chest at the same time.

But above all….

─ ‘Beautiful.’

*Hot.* Just thinking about that word made her head start emitting steam.

She never imagined that Isaac would call her beautiful.

Ever since yesterday, her heart had been racing. It was as if a regular
and intense sound was pounding in her ears.

It started out as nervousness, but after Isaac wrapped a blanket around
her and said, *‘beautiful’,* she began to feel an inexplicable sense of
ecstasy.

Kaya looked at her reflection in the mirror of the dressing table.

Her flushed cheeks… They weren’t the problem.

Her hair was sticking out of her pigtails from sleeping in the tent and
carriage, and the makeup that Mary had applied in the morning was pretty
much gone.

She hadn’t paid much attention to her usual fashion, but her disheveled
appearance today somehow bothered her. She tried to straighten her hair
afterward, but it felt like a meaningless act.

“What are you doing, me…?”

Kaya sighed as a sense of disbelief washed over her.

She couldn’t quite make sense of what she was feeling and what she was
doing.

Wasn’t it too one-dimensional to think that it was all about looks in
the first place? Isaac was the one who said it after all.

‘Was he just being nice?’

Maybe he said that because he was proud of her desire to keep the peace
of the academy.

Wasn’t it common for older people to say *‘Beautiful’* in the sense of
‘beautiful work’ when they saw a praiseworthy young child? It must be
like that.

Maybe that was it.

“…”

***I think so…***

For some reason, Kaya couldn’t take her hands off her hair for a while.

She couldn’t take her eyes off the mirror.

Attributes\] – Hunter

I gained 14 levels at once.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, your mana increased at a progressively
faster rate once you hit level 50, and I had just reached that point.

If I raised my level by just one, my mana would start to rise
significantly.

It wouldn’t be long before I learned \[Frost Explosion\].

I never thought it would be this easy.

It was a sunny afternoon. I was in the corner of the garden as usual.

I was sitting on the grass, staring down at the Sheath of Disaster in my
right hand. I didn’t want to waste any time, so I gently raised and
maintained the \[Frostfire\] in my left hand.

As long as I kept the sheath engraved with a magic circle and infused
with mana, I could use it once at any time.

Then all I had to do was charge it and use it.

I could engrave 5-star spells and below. However, the power of the spell
would be the same as my current level.

When the \[Hunter\] trait was activated, I would need to infuse more
mana into it.

‘I can’t wait to try it out.’

I couldn’t test the Sheath of Disaster right now. The moment I engrave a
magic circle on it, the sheath would be assimilated by the magic. I
wouldn’t be able to replace it with a new magic circle.

It would be most efficient to engrave \[Frost Explosion\] on the Sheath
of Disaster. In other words, I would use this item only after I had
acquired \[Frost Explosion\].

‘Not yet.’

I tucked the Sheath of Disaster into my pocket.

Next, it was time to distribute my stat points.

After I got up from my seat, I entered the status window \[Potential
&lt;&lt;Details&gt;&gt;\].

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 38 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (C): 26/100 \[UP\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (B+): 55/100 \[UP\]

– Learning Efficiency (D): 12/100 \[UP\] ◈ Elemental Resistance – Fire

– Water Resistance (D): 6/100 \[UP\]

– Ice Resistance (C-): 24/100 \[UP\]

– Lightning Element Resistance (C): 29/100 \[UP\]

– Rock esistance (E): 2/100 \[UP\]

– Wind Resistance (D): 13/100 \[UP\]

– Neutral Magic Resistance (D): 8/100 \[UP\] ◈ vs. Race Combat Power –

– vs. Other Races Combat Power (E): 1/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Demon Combat Power (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

I had 38 stat points at this time and was close to maxing out my \[Magic
Training Efficiency\].

Regardless of Isaac’s actual potential, a \[Magic Training Efficiency\]
of 100 was equivalent to a genius. My growth rate would be very fast.

However, as the grade increased, the time it took to advance to the next
grade increased dramatically.

Even if I reach a \[Magic Training Efficiency\] of 100, it would take me
a long time to improve stats beyond B+. Otherwise, the Hell difficulty
of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ would be a breeze.

To obtain Hilde’s Frostscythe, my \[Ice Elemental Resistance\] must be
at least 60, but that was something I could solve with time.

I also wanted to get my \[Physical Training Efficiency\] up. It goes
without saying that the greater your physical ability, the more
advantageous it would be in combat.

If I was not as athletic as Ian, I might find myself in a difficult
situation in the future. Besides, if I thought about my future work,
good physical fitness was essential. It would also help me with wielding
legendary weapons.

Also, now that I had some stat points to spare, it would be better to
improve my \[Learning Efficiency\] too. The higher your \[Learning
Efficiency\] was, the faster your individual magic proficiency would
grow.

It differs from \[Magic Training Efficiency\], which focuses on
improving elemental combat abilities such as \[Elemental Firepower\],
\[Elemental Efficiency\], and \[Elemental Synergy\].

It was a bonus that helped with studying.

‘I’ve decided.’

Out of the remaining stat points, I invested 13 in \[Physical Training
Efficiency\], 16 in \[Magic Training Efficiency\], and 9 in \[Learning
Efficiency\].

\[Potential \[Physical Training Efficiency\] has improved from Grade C
to Grade B-!\] \[Potential \[Magic Training Efficiency\] has improved
from Grade B+ to Grade A!\] \[Potential \[Learning Efficiency\] has
improved from Grade D to Grade C-!\]

No matter how hopeless Isaac was, if he had this much potential, he
wouldn’t bow his head to anyone.

Now it was back to training, training, and even more training.

“Whoo.”

I let out a deep breath, then raised a \[Frostfire\] in each hand.

\* \* \*

Greung.

The mysterious monster that appeared during the class placement
evaluation.

Luce Eltania, the top seat of the Magic Department at Märchen Academy,
had repeatedly asked questions about the monster’s identity.

But she had little to no success.

Besides, there was no way to figure out what elements each student
possessed.

Since the class assignment evaluation, Greung has completely
disappeared.

She searched Delphine Forest for traces of mana just in case, but there
was no sign.

‘If I had known this would happen, I would have paid more attention
during the mana evaluation.’

In that case, she would have known what elemental constitution each
student possessed.

It was the first time she regretted not paying more attention to others.

She was walking through the academy, basking in the sun with a troubled
expression, when…

*Hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa─!*

…She heard the sound of ice magic being used from somewhere.

It was similar to flames, but she could distinguish the subtle sound of
ice crystals clashing together. It was definitely ice magic.

“…?”

The element that Greung used was also Ice.

Luce recalled Greung and headed toward the corner of the garden where
the sound had come from.

She walked past the tall flower beds and avenues of trees.

Then an open lawn spread out before her.

In the midst of it, she discovered a male student sweating profusely
while practicing the 4-star ice magic \[Frostfire\].

His silver hair was half-curled with a bluish tinge, and his eyes were
blood-red with an icy gaze.

Perhaps because he was focused on his training, his eyes were staring
coldly into space.

In both of his hands, a cold flame burned. The white cold and ice mana
formed a flame, and beautiful ice crystals floated around it.

“Ha!”

The man exhaled heavily and released the \[Frostfire\].

Luce knew who he was.

Thanks to her photographic memory, she could recall him as clearly as if
she were pulling out a photograph. The man who had panicked when he saw
her during the class placement evaluation and then fled.

“…”

He’d appeared from the direction Greung had escaped, that guy.

And the ice element…

“…I don’t think so.”

For a brief moment, Luce doubted it, but she quickly shook her head.

Greung was an overwhelming force. He wouldn’t be training 4-star magic
while sweating profusely all alone like that. Moreover, judging from the
short range of \[Frostfire\], his proficiency seemed low.

It was a long way away from him.

“Ah, ahhh…”

The silver-blue-haired man’s nose began to bleed the same color as his
eyes. He let out a groan as he lowered his upper body in pain.

It seemed he had overused his mana. Luce had never experienced it, but
she knew that wizards sometimes overdid it and ended up like that.

She heard that when they reached that state, their entire body reacted
violently, making it extremely difficult to use magic.

Despite this, he wiped his nosebleeds with his sleeve before conjuring
cold flames in both hands once more.

Once again.

And then once more.

The man let out a \[Frostfire\].

“…”

Luce watched in silence.

She didn’t know why.

On the day she signed a contract with the Thunderbird Galia, the
10-year-old girl turned her gaze away from the human race in skepticism.

But now, Luce couldn’t take her eyes off the silver-blue haired man.

Was it because of Greung? Could it be that the monster awakened her
curiosity toward others?

“Hah, hah…”

The man stopped his magic and caught his breath.

He sat on the floor, lowered his head, and breathed once again.

Was it over?

…No. He stood up once more and repeated \[Frostfire\].

One more time, one more time. When it became difficult to use magic, he
did exercises like push-ups and squats to train himself physically.

For some reason, she couldn’t stop watching him.

Luce watched the man in disbelief.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Every day, the silver-blue haired man went to the garden’s corner to
practice magic.

Luce watched him, from the roof of Charles Hall, a dormitory for the top
students. From up there, she could catch a glimpse of him training.

On a moonlit night, Luce was resting her arms on the roof railing, her
long rose-gold hair and one-piece nightgown fluttering in the breeze.

She looked at the man with her hawk-like eyesight.

The man mainly practiced basic ice magic such as \[Cold Divergence\] and
\[Ice Generation\], and he was also diligently using \[Ice Wall\] and
\[Frostfire\].

Whenever he had a chance, he would clasp his hands together and gather
ice mana between them. Luce, who had basic knowledge of most elemental
magic, could easily figure out the reason.

That man must have been thinking of learning the 5-star spell \[Frost
Explosion\].

“You’re working hard.”

The night wind scattered the words that came out of her mouth. Not
knowing what he was thinking, Luce simply watched the man in silence.

…No, on second thought, she could understand.

Lightning elemental magic. Luce turned her back on that element.

She always poured lightning elemental mana into Thunderbird Galia, her
8-star familiar. Even at this very moment.

As a result, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t properly use
lightning magic.

That was why she had lived by solely relying on water magic.

She lowered her gaze to her right hand. With a crackle, electricity
flowed through her palms.

「Lightning Generation (Lightning Element, ★1)」

***Hard work, hard work, hard work.***

***What is hard work?***

As if in a shape decomposition, the two words ‘effort’ broke into pieces
and began to run through Luce’s mind.

“…”

Luce clenched her electrified hands into fists and let out a ragged
breath. Her chest was throbbing.

The image of a silver-blue haired man practicing magic even while in
pain.

It was a stark contrast to herself who kept running away from lightning
magic.

***…***

The next day, and the day after that.

The silver-blue haired man practiced magic in a corner of the garden.
Even when his nose was bleeding and his body was exhausted, he continued
to use magic.

Perhaps he was driven by a sense of improvement, but he appeared to be
compelled by some greater purpose. He seemed to have a secret that he
could never give up.

The more she watched, the more such thoughts crossed her mind. His
visage of working hard was constantly stuck in her mind.

***…***

A week later.

Last night, it seemed like the silver-blue haired man would soon be able
to use \[Frost Explosion\].

Luce was sitting on a garden bench, watching the man from afar.

He was still training his magic. He put both of his fingers together and
created a gap between them, gathering his ice mana.

Then, when a blue magic circle appeared in front of his gathered hands,
his eyes widened.

“…!”

Luce involuntarily jerked her upper body forward.

The appearance of the magic circle meant that the conditions to use the
spell had been met.

Now… was it going to happen now?

The man held out his right arm forward. In front of his right hand was a
round, condensed ball of ice mana. A light blue magic circle silently
followed his hand.

And then.

The man unleashed the condensed ice mana.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh───!!*

A powerful explosion of ice.

In the blink of an eye, a spiky, stretched-out mass of ice appeared in
front of him.

It was an ice mass at least ten meters long.

“Oh…!”

Luce let out an exclamation, unable to understand why she was clenching
her fists in excitement.

Soon, surprise flashed across the silver-blue haired man’s face, which
quickly turned into ecstasy.

“Ahhhhhh…!”

The man tightly closed his eyes, then clenched both of his hands into
fists and trembled.

Before long, he raised his head toward the sky and let out a beastly
cheer.

He even shadow-boxed the air in celebration.

“Pu-huh.”

Luce unknowingly covered her mouth with her slightly clenched fist and
laughed.

Chapter 22: - Practical Training (1)
====================================

༺ **Practical Training (1)**༻

\[Time for Practical Training\].

Since the grounds of Märchen Academy were unnecessarily large, there
were some buildings that were overly spacious.

This place, ‘Kalis Hall’ was one of those buildings.

Kalis Hall was often used for practical training. I was at the training
ground and paired up with three of my classmates from the Magic
Department.

I was in an empty room. On one side of the wall was the door we had come
in through, and on the other side was a tunnel-like passage.

In front of us, a ‘messenger’ was flapping its wings at a blinding
speed, like a fly or a hummingbird.

The messenger was a round speaker the size of a man’s fist. It was a
magic tool owned by the academy, imbued with audio transmission magic
and magic that transmitted the scene being watched as a video.

The cynical voice unique to Professor Fernando flowed through the
messenger.

\[You are divided into groups, which have been chosen at random. You
will be fighting demonic illusions. Once you’ve defeated them all and
arrived at the final destination, your performance evaluation will be
over. If someone is judged to have suffered a fatal injury, that student
will be eliminated.\]

The Kalis Hall alone could not accommodate all first-year students in
the Magic Department. Therefore, other groups not assigned to Kalis Hall
would have to go to different areas for practical training.

\[The main evaluation criterion for this practical training is how well
you understand the characteristics and weaknesses of the demonic
creatures you’ve learned about so far, as well as how you can use
elemental magic in combat. Second, how well you cooperate is also
factored into your behavioral score. It would be best to take this
seriously. We’ll start in 10 minutes. Make sure you are fully
prepared.\]

It was the start of 「Act 2, Chapter 3, Practical Training」 from ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

In this chapter, the protagonist, Ian Fairytale, became involved with
Ciel Carnedas, a Class A student.

She was one of the official heroines. Later on, she would play a key
role in assisting Ian in obtaining the ultimate weapon of the light
element, the Luminous Sword.

She took a casual attitude toward the practical training and due to her
apathy, she didn’t even care if other students got hurt by her magic.

Because of her attitude, she ended up getting into an argument with Ian.

Then, the building collapsed, Garzia the Hermit appeared, and \[Act 2,
Episode 4, Ant Legion\] began.

Ian and Ciel join forces to combat the Disaster Ant Legion, but Ciel
eventually decided to take on the Disaster Ant Legion alone.

In the meantime, Ian made his way through the ants to the center of the
building.

There, he meet and fought Garzia, the main focus of Act 2, Chapter 4.

Of course, Act 2, Chapter 4 would be skipped because I already killed
Garzia. In other words, this practical training would end peacefully.

…Maybe.

“This is a very unpleasant situation.”

As soon as Professor Fernando finished speaking, a beautiful girl spoke
with a sigh, as if she had been waiting for him to finish.

Her short light-brown hair cascaded down to her shoulders in a wave.

She wore a red rose hairpin in her hair, and the shawl draped over her
shoulders was stunning. It had a golden border and a red background
embroidered with roses.

Her bright golden eyes were looking at me.

Rose Red Rivera. She was a Class B student.

\[Rose Red Rivera\] **Lv:** 52

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Feels contempt for you.\]

“A vulgar Grade E is in our team. The lowest of the low, aren’t you?”

She said with a confident tone as she looked down on me with a mocking
expression on her face.

I was used to it now.

Just as I was about to ignore her, she stuck her head in my direction.

***Ooh, she smells good. She must be wearing expensive perfume.***

“Even a worm that crawls on the ground has a role to play. I’ll instruct
you on the role that suits you, so please don’t get in the way.”

“…………”

***Why are you so eager to start a fight? I don’t understand, really.***

The two remaining male students were unable to speak in the frightening
atmosphere.

Certainly, Rose had the ability to quickly make people nervous.

‘Ugh.’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, her role was insignificant. If I had to
say it, she was an extra, not even a supporting character. She was only
there for a short time, but she let it get to her head before being
robbed of her arrogance by Ian.

***You and I are the same, bitch.***

\[All right, the practical training starts now. Everyone enters.\]

In the heavy atmosphere, ten minutes had passed.

Professor Fernando’s voice rang from the messenger.

“Let’s go.”

Our group began to walk down the tunnel-like passageway.

The tunnel was dark, but it wasn’t long before we reached the end.

There were five demonic creatures, the ‘Black Wolf’, roaming around in
the narrow arena. It was a demonic illusion created with an Illusion
Materializer Magic Tool, there was some static in their appearance, but
it was difficult to tell unless you looked closely.

The status window did not appear. It was clearly an illusion.

We stood at the end of the tunnel and watched the black wolves. Because
the moment we stepped out of this tunnel, a fight would break out.

“They have a habit of fighting in groups. So, Mr. Alan and Mr. Ethan, I
need you to trap them with rock magic and ice magic. I’ll end it all at
once with flame magic.”

Rose naturally acted as the leader. She seemed to believe that since she
was in the highest class among us, she should be the leader.

I had no objections to her selection as a leader. The only problem was
that I wasn’t a part of her plan.

Well, since it was about black wolves, I guess they don’t need a Class D
bastard with Grade E mana, though I wasn’t really a Grade-E anymore.

Our group stepped out of the tunnel, and the wolf demonic creatures
stopped and immediately started to keep us in check.

The black wolves snarled, baring their teeth as the male students used
their magic against them.

*Dddddddd─!*

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

Crude walls of rock and ice rose from the ground, trapping the wolves
while Rose hurled flames with both hands at the monsters.

「Fireball (Fire Element, ★3)」

*Crackle─!*

*Kwaaaaaahhhh─!*

A roaring red ball of \[Fireball\] struck the wolf demons trapped by the
\[Rock Wall\] and \[Ice Wall\].

It was a fairly skilled \[Fireball\]. The wolf demons were scorched and
scattered all over the ground, and then, with a whimper, they
disappeared.

The black wolf illusion was casually repelled.

“Alright, let’s keep going.”

We followed Rose’s instructions and moved to the next passage. Demonic
creatures emerged one after the other, and Rose killed them all.

***I want to get good grades too.***

“Oh, that’s the last one.”

“Easy, easy.”

Finally, we had reached the final stage. Rose and the male students were
conversing quietly. The male students seemed to be in a good mood since
they were performing well thanks to Rose.

Judging by the fact that she didn’t give me any instructions, even after
reaching the final stage, it was clear she had no intention of using me.

After passing through the passageway, we came to a large room with a
marble floor. In the middle of the stage, the final boss stood guard.

It was an illusion of ‘Tauro’, a giant bull-like demon creature who
appeared to be humanoid. It was at least four meters tall and held a
large spear in its right hand.

Now I really had to play an active role. This wasn’t the time to pander
to Rose.

So, when I raised my right hand to create a \[Frostfire\], Rose glared
at me cynically.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m trying to get some points. Collaboration is another criterion for
evaluation, so wouldn’t it be nice to work together?”

I answered in the kindest way possible with a capitalist smile on my
face.

Rose’s eyes narrowed in disgust, as if she were looking at a bug.

“Gross.”

“Huh?”

For a brief moment, I doubted my ears.

“You’re a Grade E, you don’t even know the subject. Don’t be disgusting.
I am the leader here, and I want you to wait until I tell you what to
do. Do you understand?”

“…”

**…Did I go too far?**

“Mr. Alan, Mr. Ethan. Let’s go.”

Rose and two male students walked out of the tunnel. I looked at her in
disbelief for a moment before following them.

Then.

*Roaring—!*

“Aaah, fire!”

「Fire Generation (Fire Element, ★1)」

Flames suddenly engulfed me. It surrounded me in a circle, leaving no
openings for me to escape through.

“Didn’t I tell you not to interfere?”

***Wow, that bitch. You’re going way too far.***

***What the hell am I dealing with?***

Only then did Tauro, the humanoid demon resembling a bull, recognize our
group.

Rose, Alan, and Ethan took up a fighting stance.

“Mr. Alan, Mr. Ethan! Formation…! Huh…?!”

Rose swallowed hard as she tried to give instructions.

*Whooooooooo─!*

“Waaaah!”

“Aaah!”

*Beep-!*

In one swift motion, Tauro leaped at Alan and Ethan and swung his spear.
A loud horn rang from the bracelets of the two male students.

The bracelets were glowing red. They had been eliminated.

\[Alan Neville, Ethan Purcell. Eliminated.\]

Cold sweat dripped down Rose’s cheeks. She, like the two male students,
would have been eliminated if she had gone one step further.

Even from afar, it startled me. But Rose, who saw it right in front of
her, would be absolutely terrified.

The door to the elimination room creaked open. All movements must be
stopped until the eliminated are all gone.

Even the Tauro illusion remained motionless in a spear-wielding stance.

The losers walked towards the elimination door, a look of resentment on
their faces. Now, the moment they step through, the door would be firmly
closed, and Tauro would start moving again.

“Y-you!”

Rose turned to me. Her voice was trembling with urgency.

“Well, I’ll give you a chance to perform…! You wanted to fight, right?
Be the bait. Meanwhile, I’ll use my fire magic to defeat that demon!”
Rose said, placing a hand on her chest. Her voice was high and
commanding like a young lady’s, but trembling with fear.

I recalled a conversation I had with the NPC Rose Red Rivera while
playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Her obsession with being the ‘best of the best’ haunted her. It was a
mindset instilled in her by the Red Rivera family through their rigorous
training.

However, hard work alone was not enough to beat the talented students of
Märchen Academy.

The fact that she was in Class B rather than Class A, which was the
best, must have ripped her heart out.

She was even ranked at the bottom of Class B.

She couldn’t help but feel impatient because she believed that she
always gave her best effort. This, of course, included this practical
training.

That was why she was trying to create an opening by using me as a
sacrifice for Tauro and then attacking. If she wanted to become the best
at Märchen Academy, she couldn’t be eliminated here.

And that way, she would look like she was doing her best.

By the way…

‘I think you should put out the fire first…’

She appeared to be in a hurry and wasn’t thinking straight.

“Answer me!”

As the dropouts exited through the door, Rose screamed at the top of her
lungs, her blood rising to her neck.

***What could be the answer? Do it yourself.***

────\[Ooooohhhhhhhhh!\]

Tauro roared, resuming the practical training.

Rose’s face became pensive.

Just as Tauro was about to swing his spear again, Rose quickly reached
down and poured fire mana into it.

A red magic circle materialized on the ground and a pillar of flame
erupted from beneath Tauro.

*Hwahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh─!!*

「Flame Pillar (Fire Element, ★4)」

Tauro immediately leaped backward to avoid Rose’s attack. Despite his
large size, he showed nimble movements and superb athleticism.

“Ahhh…”

People who were good at magic were not always good at combat. Rose, for
example, was not very good at fighting.

Her entire body trembled at the sight of Tauro, who refused to submit to
her magic right away.

From the sound of her sobbing, she was probably in the midst of some
ongoing frustration.

This was a stark reminder as to why she didn’t make it to the top of the
class ranking.

Tauro, who had gained some distance from the \[Flame Pillar\], began to
lunge at Rose again.

***─This is the time.***

Rose’s aggro was working well. Now was the time for me to make my move.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

Just as Rose’s mana control was disrupted and the surrounding flames
started to dissipate, I created ice to cover the flames.

Then I took off running towards Rose.

On the other side, Tauro was also charging toward her, just like me. But
no matter how many fire spells she threw at him, Tauro easily dodged it
and closed the distance between them.

Realizing that she had lost, she dropped to the ground in despair. She
was about to give her throat to the charging Tauro.

‘Giving up already.’

Pathetic. Well, I guess it didn’t matter.

Rose was still quite a distance away. Even my front was obscured by her
back, so the angle for attacks was not ideal.

Team kills were out of the question. But it would be a waste not to take
advantage of this useful situation where she was acting as bait.

Luckily, I had a solution.

I took out the dagger I had been holding. It was the dagger housed
inside the ‘Sheath of Disaster’.

‘Here I go!!’

I fiercely threw the dagger at Tauro with the Sheath of Disaster,
drawing all the strength I had gained from the hell-like PT.

*Whirl*—!

The dagger whirled around, cutting through the air without hesitation.

It flew past Rose and reached Tauro, who was charging at her.

I could feel the mana circuits in my body connecting with the flying
*Sheath of Disaster.*

The moment Tauro reached Rose and swung his spear, I felt the sensation
intensify.

Then, as if a trigger had been pulled, the magic circle engraved on the
*‘Sheath of Disaster’* glowed pale blue and activated, unleashing a
flood of ice.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaah───!*

It happened in a flash.

The ice crystals and cold air swirled in a chaotic manner, and the ice
that surged from the sheath of my dagger devoured Tauro.

Before I knew it, a jagged block of ice had taken over the center of the
battlefield.

Soon, Tauro’s shape vanished without a trace inside the block of ice.

At the same time, Rose’s bracelet rang loudly.

\[Rose Red Rivera eliminated.\]

The messenger announced her elimination in a calm voice. Just before my
*Sheath of Disaster* could activate its magic, Tauro’s spear struck her.

Well, it didn’t really matter, as I had no intention of saving her in
the first place. Who would want to save someone who looked down on you?

Rose’s eyes were closed tightly and her head was bowed. She trembled and
barely opened her eyes.

Coincidentally, I had just picked up the *Sheath of Disaster* that had
fallen in front of the ice block and was clutching it in my arms.

“Uh…? Wh-what happened…?”

Rose asked in confusion.

I sighed, not wanting to see her appearance that was prone to despairing
during battle.

“What are you doing?”

With my back to the large ice block, a white chill flowed around me.

I said that so monotonously that Rose swallowed her breath and widened
her eyes in disbelief.

I unfroze the ice. Then, the large block of ice began to crack apart,
turning into a blue powder that scattered into the air.

Then I turned my back and started walking down the next passage to my
final destination.

Rose didn’t stand up for a while. Her next destination was the
elimination gate that had just opened up.

“&gt;

<span id="0022_23_-_Practical_Training_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 23: - Practical Training (2)
====================================

༺ **Practical Training (2)**༻

Professor Fernando stood at the final destination. He looked at me with
his usual cold blue eyes.

His teaching assistant walked over and took the performance evaluation
bracelet from me while muttering, “That, yes, yes…” He looked like a
zombie, overworked and exhausted.

Professor Fernando, who handled such an assistant, was like a
necromancer.

“Group F, Practical Training is over. The results will be announced and
feedback will be delivered in a week. Good work.”

“Can I tell the people in my group about that?”

I asked, since they had all been eliminated.

“It doesn’t matter. Anyway, I’ll deliver it to them all at once before
class starts tomorrow.”

Professor Fernando then told us that we could go home. Alan and Ethan,
the first to fail, had already returned to their dorms.

The manner in which the performance evaluation was conducted, as well as
the specific assessments made, were strictly confidential. Hence, there
was no need to worry about the student council president, Alice Carroll,
discovering something suspicious like the *Sheath of Disaster.*

The only thing made public were the Grades. A week later, the results
would be posted in the central hall of Orphin Hall.

‘Can I expect a better grade this time?’

Even though I only got to perform once because of Rose, I still managed
to defeat the final boss.

***Can’t I have some expectations?***

Of course, now that I had enough gels and had tested the performance of
the *Sheath of Disaster*, there was no need to actually dwell on the
results of this performance evaluation.

Still, it would be nice to get a good grade.

I walked out of Kalis Hall. The bright sunlight shining down was so
dazzling that I momentarily shielded my eyes with my hand.

My entire body felt unusually light. It reminded me of how I felt in
high school when I went home early after midterm exams.

But it wasn’t time to play around. I had to begin training immediately.

I’d barely begun walking outside Kalis Hall when I was stopped by
someone saying “Wait a minute!” It was a fierce, yet delicate, young
lady’s voice.

“How did you do it?”

It was Rose who asked me that. She stood in the shade of the building
with her arms crossed while glaring at me.

“What?”

I knew what she meant, but I was deliberately pretending to be clueless.

*Snap.*

Rose took a step toward me, veins forming on her forehead.

“I don’t understand how you, a Grade-E, can defeat Tauro! Even if it was
an illusion, I don’t see how you could have defeated something so
powerful! And besides, what the hell did you do? There’s no way you, a
Grade-E of Class D, the lowest of the low, could have used five-star
magic already!”

Her voice was filled with tears, the way she tried to deny it was truly
pitiful.

It was probably her tendency to restore her self-esteem by putting
others down.

But her pride was crushed in front of the person she looked down upon
the most.

She must have been devastated that another person had so effortlessly
jumped over a wall that she couldn’t.

Therefore, she tried to hide her own weakness by denying me. Otherwise,
she would fall apart.

I often saw people like her in Sillim-dong^1^Sillim-Dong is a statutory
division of Gwanak District in Seoul, Korea. Korea National University
is here which is most likely what Isaac is referring to here.. Those
kids definitely couldn’t pass the exam.

“You conceded to me a hundred times, why didn’t you save me when you had
the means to defeat the enemy? Are you kidding me?”

But there was a very good lesson in this.

***What’s the secret to being happy? It’s to not argue with fools.***

“Whatever.”

“Eh…!”

When I snapped at her with an icy glare, Rose’s face blushed red, angry
to the point of tears. I wonder if she was speechless because she was so
angry and frustrated.

Well, I was sure she was aware of how pitiful she sounded.

“Ah, ughhh…!”

Rose gritted her teeth and stomped her foot.

She didn’t seem to have anything else to say, so I just started moving
my feet again.

***You stay down there.***

***I’ll head to the top.***

\* \* \*

A professor at the Märchen Academy’s Magic Department must be
well-versed in all theories of magic.

Fernando Frost became a full-time professor at Märchen Academy’s Magic
Department at the tender age of 25 based solely on his theoretical
skills.

Even at Märchen Academy, which gathered the best talents from across the
continent, he was regarded as an object of envy. He was gifted with a
great intellect, an outstanding appearance, and the ability to give a
lecture that resonated in your ears.

As such, Fernando’s near-perfect appearance was the result of his
rigorous self-care and obsession.

His appearance was immaculate. Sitting in a chair with his back straight
and his posture upright. He mustn’t look disheveled even when no one was
looking.

Every action he took must be dignified, as befitted an elite professor
at an elite academy.

Deep in the night. The rain was pounding against the windows.

The sound of rain broke the silence of the night.

Fernando was sitting in the office in Orphin Hall, a building in the
Magic Department, reviewing the results of the practical training.

Meanwhile, all kinds of documents were properly lined up in the air.
Fernando had suspended them in midair with telekinesis magic.

*Knock.*

Hearing a knock on the door, Fernando raised his head.

“Ahhhhh…”

“Marco. Come in.”

Marco, a male assistant with brown hair, stepped into the office. His
soul-less face did not resemble that of a human.

He walked over to where Fernando was sitting and handed him the papers.

“Uh-huh.”

Marco grunted like a zombie as Fernando accepted the papers he had
handed him. It was a document that summarized each student’s practical
training results, including grades and evaluation reviews.

He had to review it to make sure there were no issues before sending it
up the chain of command. Fernando skimmed through it, confirmed that
there were no obvious problems, and nodded.

“Next, this one.”

“Uh-huh…!”

When Fernando pointed to the stack of papers next to him, Marco let out
a sob that closely resembled a scream. However, the assistant had no
other choice.

Marco, with both hands, picked up the stack of papers that were piled
high enough to cover his upper body, and trudged out of the office.

Today, too, he would need to stay up all night.

“…….”

Fernando flipped through the papers, reading them quickly with his
telekinetic magic.

In today’s practical training, he was assigned with overseeing Kalis
Hall. He was using a crystal ball, just like the examiners, to monitor
the progress of each group’s performance evaluation through a messenger.

In this practical training, his role was to guide the performance
evaluation.

To make sure that no problems occurred during the evaluation.

If something went wrong, he had to fix it.

And to remove the eliminated students from the field.

Currently, he was evaluating the students after checking the videos of
the practical training at each location.

This time, the first years of the Magic Department could hardly be
called the ‘Jade Generation’, but as with every year, there were some
diamonds in the rough.

‘Top Seat, Luce Eltania.’

Luce Eltania, the top seat of the Magic Department. Her mana capacity
was overwhelming. Both her mana control and elemental firepower were
impeccable. During the practical training, she used water magic to
defeat the illusions of monsters with ease.

However, her collaboration score with her teammates, was zero due to her
lack of social skills. Even when her teammates were friendly with her,
she remained cynical.

***You can’t survive on the battlefield alone.*** Luce Eltania’s
weakness was her uncooperative, dogmatic attitude.

‘And second seat, Kaya Astrean…’

Kaya Astrean, a first-year student and the second seat of the Magic
Department. She was the student with the second-highest mana capacity
after Luce Eltania.

Her skills were also impeccable, but she was an unfortunate prodigy who
was overshadowed by Luce Eltania.

‘Ciel Carnedas needs to reflect.’

Ciel Carnedas, a top-ranking student in the Magic Department, had shown
no remorse for hurting her teammates.

She even got into a fight with Ian Fairytale, who was in the same group
as her.

Even if she has excellent magic skills, her divisive attitude reflected
poorly on her collaboration score.

‘Mateo Jordana is pretty good.’

Mateo Jordana, one of the top students in the Magic Department, was one
of the topics of gossip among students. Contrary to rumors, he had a
diligent side.

Compared to Luce Eltania or Kaya Astrean, he was on the weak side.

During his practical training, he used effective tactics while aiming
for the weak points of the demonic creatures.

In addition, he had the charisma to make his members follow him. He
possessed the qualities of a leader.

‘Tristan Humphrey… has talent in magic, but he has a lot of problems.’

Tristan Humphrey was another outstanding first-year student in the Magic
Department. While his elemental magic was powerful, he had a lot to work
on.

To begin with, it was a major issue to give up the task of analyzing the
weaknesses of the demonic creatures while simply firing powerful magic.

While the power of his magic was strong enough to defeat the demonic
creature illusions, it deserved the worst score in the *‘*whether they
fought while considering magic efficiency’ evaluation section.

In addition, because of his family’s prestige, he compelled the students
to follow him. His collaboration score was also zero.

In the midst of evaluating the students, Fernando stopped moving in the
material for Group F of the practical training.

“This kid…”

If he had to choose the student who stood out the most today, it would
definitely be a male student named Isaac from Class D.

Silver hair with a hint of blue and blood-red eyes. He was a student who
came out with Grade E during the mana measurement class and was clearly
embedded into Fernando’s memory.

This student had used the 5-star spell \[Frost Explosion\] today. The
skill level seemed low, but it was certain.

It looked like he used a magic tool. Was there a magic tool that could
engrave a 5-star magic circle?

The world of magic tools was vast, so Fernando couldn’t easily figure it
out. However, common sense dictated that the existence of a magic tool
capable of engraving a 5-star spell was an anomaly.

In theory, there was no problem. As long as the number of mana circuits
in the magic tool was extremely high and the durability was very good.
However, that level must be extremely high in order to withstand 5-star
magic.

In other words, you couldn’t get away with the structural issues of the
tool. However, his main concern was the user of the magic tool.

It was hard to put anything above 3-star magic into a magic tool. This
was because the magic circuit itself was much more advanced than that of
a 1-star or 2-star magic, and the amount of mana that needed to be
stored was different.

This meant that, even if a magic tool contained 3-star magic or higher,
the user must be able to use the magic in order for the complex spell to
be triggered. Otherwise, the trigger wouldn’t activate. Exceptions
belonged in the realm of the impossible and were unworthy of discussion.

Perhaps the professors who acted as examiners were searching through the
books right now to figure out the identity of the magic tool Isaac used.
It would be difficult to ask directly, as contacting students about exam
content was prohibited by the Marx Pact.

Fernando was curious as well, but he was no exception to the ban.

‘The mana evaluation was only two months ago. What are the odds that a
student with Grade-E mana would be able to learn 5-star magic in just
two months?’

…Not impossible. However, it was extremely, terribly low.

***If he was originally a genius that lived without realizing that
fact…***

***Is it possible that he realized his genius only after entering the
academy?***

‘It’s not a novel or a play…’

Could there be such a dramatic story?

Fernando stroked his chin, pondering, then shook his head.

There could be such a student. In fact, this student’s performance
scores had been steadily rising.

There was also a record of him recently repaying all of his bank loans
at once, including the interest at maturity, without waiting for the
loan’s scheduled deadline and without paying the accrued interest.

He must have been working diligently. It could have been a case of him
awakening to his magic talents.

This was the prestigious Märchen Academy, after all. It was a place
where nothing was out of the ordinary, no matter how brilliant the
student.

“…”

Professor Fernando decided it would be better to give a positive review
this time.

He wrote an additional personal evaluation of Isaac’s feedback.

\[Isaac is a student who has shown exceptional growth. He tends to rely
heavily on magic tools as an alternative to mana, but given the timing
at which he uses it, he deserves a positive evaluation for his actual
combat ability. However, as a first-year student, it seems necessary to
refrain from using magic tools as much as possible and focus on
developing the ability to effectively apply pure personal abilities.\]

Students who demonstrated their potential were fascinating to watch.
Aside from Isaac, Ian Fairytale, who was also evaluated as Grade E in
terms of mana, was also showing incredible growth these days.

“It’s fun…”

***Watching the students you teach grow.***

That was Fernando’s favourite aspect of his job as an Academy professor.

Chapter 24: - Dorothy (1)
=========================

༺ **Dorothy (1)**༻

The morning sun was peeking through the curtains.

Mary, the Astrean family’s exclusive maid, woke up with a firm spirit.

She got out of bed and folded the duvet neatly.

After a light meal of a sandwich and hot coffee, she washed up and
changed into her maid outfit, and neatly combed her long purple hair.

The whole process was done like a machine. Her place was neat and tidy,
and everything was well-organized.

She inspected herself in the full-length mirror, tying her finely combed
hair into a ponytail while checking the fit of her clothes. Everything
seemed fine.

The 20-year-old maid tidied herself up and left the maids’ quarters.

In a room on the 4th floor of Charles Hall – the top-class dormitory of
Märchen Academy – there was a young lady she served.

The young lady was always up on time. Her long green hair was disheveled
as she sat on the bed, dozing off.

Even when she was dozing off, she kept the duvet neatly folded, a habit
she inherited from her father, Gerald Astrean, the head of the
household.

Mary served the young lady breakfast, which she ate blessedly well, for
she was a voracious eater.

When the young lady finished being bathed and was dressed in her school
uniform, Mary trimmed her hair and sat her down at the dressing table to
make her face even prettier. Then, with a black cloth, her light green
hair was tied into two pigtails.

Even today, Lady Kaya Astrean looked perfect.

Mary was satisfied.

“Mary.”

“Yes, my lady.”

***But why?***

Kaya glanced up and down at her reflection in the mirror, and then a
frown formed on her face.

‘What is it?’

***Your appearance looks perfect today too, doesn’t it?***

“Well, I’m feeling a little…”

“I’ll fix it.”

Kaya didn’t really care about her appearance. It was only because she
was from Duke Astrean’s household that she had to dress up beautifully
with the aid of a maid to protect her dignity.

As such, Kaya had never once expressed dissatisfaction with Mary’s work.

In addition, Kaya’s appearance, which was created by Mary’s touch, had
always been praised by many.

Mary’s skill at styling played a large part in her being selected as
Kaya’s exclusive maid, and ending up following her to Märchen Academy.

In other words, her ability to dress up Kaya in the prettiest way
possible was something she took pride in. Nobody could ever take Mary’s
pride away from her.

As such, Mary couldn’t help but have doubts.

Did she make a mistake without realizing it?

…No. She closely examined the young lady’s reflection in the mirror, and
found nothing wrong with her work.

The two-pronged hairstyle was perfectly symmetrical. The make-up was
also perfectly suited to the innocent, yet elegant appearance of a
student. As usual, a pretty lady was there.

***So, what’s the issue? I mean, what did I overlook?***

“I’m thinking of changing my style for once… What do you think?”

“…Yes?”

“Making it a little more feminine…?”

Lady Kaya said with her eyes raised, as if it were something she uttered
after careful consideration.

Mary wondered why the young lady had a sudden change of heart, and
instinctively guessed the reason.

“Lady Kaya, may I ask why you want to change your style?”

“Just… I want to dress up a bit more.”

“………!”

She was ashamed of herself that Lady Kaya wanted to embellish herself
further.

Mary sighed.

She wanted to accept it as a simple desire to become prettier, but Lady
Kaya’s behavior had been far too suspicious as of late.

She showed a dazed appearance as if she were an empty shell, or she
would be lying in bed at bedtime, kicking the duvet out of the way
saying, ‘Why did that happen?’ and then…

‘Ah…’

A recent suspicious memory flashed through Mary’s mind.

She went to her room to serve tea to Lady Kaya, only to find her
silently looking out of the window.

There was no response when she knocked on the door and asked to enter.

Mary snuck over to the side and watched her. Lady Kaya was blushing with
a blank expression on her face while staring at a silver-blue haired man
passing

Then, when Mary said that she had served her tea one more time, Lady
Kaya’s face flushed with surprise and embarrassment.

“Mary?”

The moment had come.

It was obvious that Lady Kaya had a crush on the silver-blue haired man.

‘Since when?’

Maybe the last time she stayed out?

That was the day Mary’s life expectancy was cut short. She was so
worried, she thought she was going to die.

Fortunately, Lady Kaya came back safely, and said*, ‘I have been
protecting the peace of the Academy…’* Even though Mary didn’t
understand what she meant, she assumed everything was fine since Lady
Kaya said such things with a serious face.

Lady Kaya’s behavior only became strange after that.

At that time, what if she had stayed out with a man overnight, could it
have been that silver-blue haired man?

‘It’s a mistake.’

She would not have done anything indecent. Because if she did, it would
have been plainly obvious on the young lady’s face.

But the mere fact that she had stayed up all night with a man must have
been a tremendous stimulus to Lady Kaya because of her vulnerability
towards the opposite sex.

***Until she graduates from the academy, treat her as though she is a
man.***

That was the order of the family head, Gerald Astrean.

She could clearly imagine his enraged figure.

Mary rubbed her forehead. Her head was already throbbing.

“…My Lady, this appearance suits you the best.”

“Is that so? It can’t be helped then…”

Kaya twirled her fingers through her ponytail with a flushed face.

The surrounding atmosphere seemed to be indifferent to Mary’s feelings
of frustration and disappointment towards herself.

-   ·····

─ ‘House Astrean Code of Conduct! What is the third principle?!’

─ ‘Second daughter, Kaya Astrean! Respect your instructors! Respect your
elders! Behave with respect to those who deserve it! Maintain your
appearance!’

The family Code of Conduct was etched into Kaya Astrean’s mind by Gerald
Astrean.

The real meaning behind the third principle was…

*‘Train yourself to be a person who, in the future, can stand shoulder
to shoulder with those you admire.’*

However, Kaya realized that she hadn’t been living up to the teachings
properly.

‘I want to look good for Sir Isaac.’

The only person that Kaya currently admired was Isaac.

Did she present him with a neat demeanor and a decent appearance? No.

Speaking on her demeanor, she only showed immaturity when they went to
take down the ant demons.

Every time she thought of the foolish side she showed to Isaac, she
kicked the fuzzy duvet while thinking, *‘Why did I do that?’*

Besides, what about her appearance? Wasn’t she always wearing the same
outfit? Even in front of the person she admired, she didn’t look any
different from her childhood self.

“Ugh…”

Kaya arrived at the Class A lecture hall for her morning class.

Her mind was filled with thoughts about Isaac. But the fact that she
hadn’t seen him much lately made her heart sink.

Whenever she looked at Isaac, he seemed to radiate an ethereal light,
but she lacked the courage to approach that light.

Even when he’d told her never to stalk— observe him again.

If he had reached the realm of an Archwizard, he would easily notice
Kaya’s approach. She couldn’t afford to observe him.

It was simply a matter of speaking to him normally.

But after returning from defeating the ant demons, she became nervous
when standing in front of him. It felt psychologically difficult.

‘The House Astrean Code of Conduct… was it always this difficult to
follow, father?’

She thought about changing her appearance at the very least, in an
attempt to catch Isaac’s eye.

When Mary told her that her usual twin tails suited her best, she
couldn’t say anything. Kaya was never much of a beautician, even in her
own mind.

‘I want to see Isaac…’

She just had to go for it, what was so difficult about it? She knew the
answer, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

Kaya wrapped her hands around her head and groaned.

\* \* \*

***I’ve decided.***

***Let’s give Kaya a gift.***

She was extremely helpful when I went to kill Garzia the Hermit. If I
didn’t give her something in return, my heart would be troubled.

However, because she had a lot of gel and lacked financial constraints,
monetary rewards were unlikely to appeal to her.

‘Then, should I give her an item exclusive to the heroines?’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, you could give a heroine a gift that she
would like in order to increase her likability. The chocolate that I
gave to Amy during the childhood friend kidnapping case was one of those
gifts.

Kaya was also one of the official heroines. I knew very well what types
of gifts she would like.

Among them, the best was by far the ‘Armana Wand’. Among the heroines’
endgame weapons, this was the only item that could be obtained from the
secret shop.

A wand made of the 8-star giant tree ‘Armana’, which guarded the Great
Forest. It was the only wand among the ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ weapons
that resonated with plant mana. In addition, it had a gemstone made by
condensing Armana’s mana.

In other words, if she had it, she would be much more attuned with plant
mana.

The \[Elemental Firepower\] and \[Elemental Efficiency\] of the existing
elemental magic would also noticeably improve.

If Kaya had a great desire for improvement, she would jump up and down
with happiness the moment she received it.

‘It’s so expensive…’

I walked out of the secret shop after buying the Armana Wand.

The Armana Wand was very expensive. The price was a whopping 120,000
gels. That was why at the beginning of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it
felt like a pipe dream.

‘It’s surprising that I still have money left over.’

Even after using 120,000 gels, I still had quite a bit of gel left.

The academy provided all the textbooks and high-end writing supplies. I
wouldn’t have to worry about the cost of living as long as I didn’t
spend too much.

I checked the Armana Wand as I walked. On the outside, it appeared to be
a piece of grayish-brown wood with a gemstone roughly inserted into it.
But it would feel different in the hands of someone with excellent mana
perception.

***I have to give it to Kaya later when the time is right.***

I went back to the dormitory, put the Armana Wand in a box, and headed
to the corner of the garden as usual.

Now that I had finished my lessons for the day, it was time to focus on
training.

I arrived at a corner of the garden and took my seat.

‘I feel like I’m going to level up today.’

I was filled with excitement.

After some light stretching, I conjured up a \[Frostfire\] in each hand.

……

In the evening, the night sky was slowly driving away the glow of the
sunset.

In a corner of the garden, the grass was frozen around me. These were
the traces of me using magic in order to increase the proficiency of
\[Frost Explosion\], \[Frostfire\], and \[Ice Wall\].

I only used \[Frost Explosion\] once, since using it consumed a third of
my total mana.

But the increase in proficiency was proportional to the amount of mana
consumed, so my proficiency would rise quickly even if I used it fewer
times than other spells.

I was in the middle of casting a spell when the leveling system window
popped up in front of me.

My level had increased by 1.

‘That’s great!’

I was overjoyed.

I finally reached the mana power spike zone, level 51. My mana increased
to 1000 in one fell swoop! My mana that was only rising gradually
before, had now increased by half of my previous mana.

\[Frost Explosion\] consumed 200 mana each time it was used. Thus, after
using it 3 times, I would almost run out of mana, but now it was
possible to use it 4 or 5 times.

In addition, the increase in mana rose exponentially with each level, to
the point where the expression ‘exponential’ would be overshadowed.

***The Isaac Coin is going to skyrocket\~***

“Huh?”

While I was happily looking at the system window, a new system window
suddenly appeared and overlapped it.

\[You have acquired the passive skill \[Demon Detection\] through the
effect of the unique trait \[Hunter\]!\]

Oh right. If I had the unique trait \[Hunter\], I would be granted a
passive skill based on my level.

By the time I got \[Hunter\] in the game, I was already at a high level,
so I didn’t realize that I had already acquired it.

I opened the status window, went to the \[Skill Tree
&lt;&lt;Details&gt;&gt;\], and tapped on the \[Neutral\] slot which
activated the passive skill \[Demon Detection\], a skill derived from
the unique trait \[Hunter\].

\[Demon Detection (★5)\] Detects nearby demons and determines their
identity. As you level up, the range at which you can detect demons
increases.

**Type:** Passive Skill

**Elements:** Neutral

**Acquisition Conditions:**

– Lv 51 (O)

– Possesses Unique Trait \[Hunter\] (O)

I knew where and how the demons would appear in the future.

But I wasn’t sure if they would behave the way I wanted them to.
Meaning, \[Demon Detection\] would be useful at times.

I invested the newly acquired 2 stat points in \[Physical Training
Efficiency\].

I had to train and study at the same time, and this routine required
tremendous stamina. Perhaps it was because of my recent investment in
\[Physical Training Efficiency\] that I noticed an increase in stamina.
Thanks to this, I felt that my overall training efficiency had
increased.

Besides, my \[Magic Training Efficiency\] was Grade A, so I could afford
to do it.

It would be better to invest in \[Physical Training Efficiency\] as much
as possible and aim to become Iron Man Isaac.

\[Potential \[Physical Training Efficiency\] has improved from Grade B-
to Grade B!\]

‘Good.’

Now, there are only three events left that could be considered important
until the end of the first semester of the first year. The Duel,
Familiar Summoning, and End-of-Semester Evaluations.

The Dueling Chapter in Act 3, Scene 1 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was
significant because it showed Ian Fairytale challenging Luce Eltania to
a duel and fighting, revealing to the students that he had the light
element constitution. There was no need for me to intervene, as there
was no impending bad end.

There was also nothing special about summoning a familiar. I guess you
could say it was a good thing in terms of increasing my power, but there
was no crisis.

There was a reason why these crisis-free chapters would be repeated
twice. It was because the last part of the first semester, the
Thunderbird Subjugation, was excruciatingly difficult.

So far, thanks to the \[Hunter\] trait, I had been overwhelmingly
destroying the demons, but I really needed to be prepared to die during
the end-of-semester evaluation. It was because the Thunderbird Galia is
extremely powerful.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the maximum level was 200 and the level of
Thunderbird Galia was 175. On the other hand, even with the \[Hunter\]
trait activated, I would be level 151.

The higher the level, the greater the gap a single level caused. In
fact, it meant that it would be impossible to win against the
Thunderbird.

The best I could do was avoid him as much as possible.

The villain of the Thunderbird Subjugation part was ‘Vera the Summoner’.
If I killed that bastard before being overwhelmed by the Thunderbird,
the situation would be over.

‘I have to train hard.’

Now was the time to focus on my training.

Slapping my cheeks with both hands to drive away my worries, I put my
fingers together and created a gap between my hands.

Ice mana began to condense as it flowed through the gap.

Light blue ice mana condensed into a dense mass. It flowed quietly, like
the calm before a storm, and gathered in my hand, softly shining like
moonlight.

In order to use \[Frost Explosion\] with the body of an ordinary Isaac,
it was necessary to spend time in this position.

It took about 5 seconds to condense mana as quickly as possible and use
\[Frost Explosion\]. If I wanted to increase the power, I needed to
spend more time in the preparation process.

Condensing to 15 seconds was the limit at my current level. After that,
the mana stopped gathering and leaked into the surroundings.

Then, in my mind, I engraved the magic circle for \[Frost Explosion\].

When the magic circle of \[Frost Explosion\] appeared in the air, it
implied that the spell activation condition had been met. It appeared in
front of my hand this time.

The light blue mana that had condensed in front of my hand began to
rotate slowly. It was a shape that seemed to gather the radiating cold
air.

I held it in my right hand and extended my right arm forward, aiming at
the air.

The magic circle of \[Frost Explosion\] followed the movement of my
right hand. Now that I shot this…

“Waaaahhhh!!”

***What was that? A scream?***

No, it seemed like laughter.

My concentration shattered in surprise, and the condensed mana was
dispelled.

I raised my head.

*In the sunset sky, a female student was falling at a terrifying speed.*

*A witch hat pressed tightly against her head, a shawl draped over her
shoulders, and the hem of her skirt fluttering wildly.*

*Her long, flowing hair was a light shade of purple, tied up at the very
end.*

*And a slight glimpse of her face full of laughter could be seen from
under the hat.*

*Chararara─*

*A cluster of beautiful, vibrant starlight flowed out from the girl’s
toes, causing her fall to slow dramatically.*

She landed lightly in front of me.

At the same time, the starlight that was seeping out disappeared.

“Ahahaha! Ahh, that was fun\~”

She, who had a pretty and cute appearance, smiled brightly as she let
out a cheerful voice.

‘Oh my god…’

For a brief moment, I wondered if I was mistaken.

As long as I was transmigrated in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I was bound
to see her someday.

An opponent I hadn’t expected to suddenly fall out of the sky.

It was like running into a celebrity when you least expected it.

“Hmm?”

She turned to face me, as if she had finally noticed my presence.

With eyes that seemed to contain the universe, her star-shaped pupils
captured my appearance.

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Lv:** 180

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Rock, Starlight

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[★☆★☆★☆★\]

Officially, everyone could only use two types of elements. The only
exception was when you received the power of a fairy. Just like the girl
standing right in front of me.

She had made a contract with Stella, the Star Fairy, and used magic with
an unusual element called ‘Starlight’. It wasn’t derived from the main
elements, but it was an element in its own realm, so there is nothing to
discuss.

That was why she was called the ‘Star Witch’ and was one of the most
powerful forces in the academy.

“Huh, you’re a first year.”

◆◆◆◆◆────

“What were you doing here?”

She asked with a smile as she straightened her witch hat.

It was Dorothy Heartnova, my favorite character.

<span id="0024_25_-_Dorothy_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 25: - Dorothy (2)
=========================

༺ **Dorothy (2)**༻

A magic talent that seemed to be blessed by the heavens. The depth of
her power was said to be unfathomable.

With a level of 180, she was overwhelming.

‘Oh my…’

I never thought I would see Dorothy Heartnova in person. I couldn’t help
but be mesmerized by her beauty.

Perhaps, because she was the character that I liked the most, it may
have been that I was looking forward to seeing her.

A small blue jewel brooch hung from the ribbon of her school uniform.
The color blue represented second year.

“I was training… but what about Senior?”

I struggled to maintain my composure, and when asked what I was doing
here, I responded back with a question.

Despite asking just now, I already had a guess as to why Dorothy fell
from the sky.

She must have descended from the sky while admiring nature’s beauty.

She did it here and there, but today she just happened to use the corner
of the garden as a landing point.

“Me? You saw, didn’t you? I was falling from the sky!”

“Then why were you falling from the sky?”

“I was watching the rain clouds gather. I left because there was nothing
more to see, so I came down.”

Dorothy answered with a smile.

“When I’m up there, I can see the horizon. I love the line between the
sunset sky and the sea. It’s so romantic to watch the sun disappear
beyond the horizon.”

In an excited voice, she started talking about things I wasn’t even
curious about.

“I especially enjoy the moment when rain clouds form. Should I call it
aesthetically pleasing? So! I was flying around watching it when I said,
‘I’m done now,’ and came down.”

“…….”

“Nihihi.”

Dorothy said innocently.

Her starlight magic allowed her to manipulate natural world forces such
as gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak forces, which allowed
her to see the horizon as she levitated.

It was on an entirely different level from simply floating with wind
magic.

“So, what kind of training are you doing? Ice element? Why are you doing
it here? Are you usually alone? What kind of magic are you using? How
many stars can you use up to?”

She walked up to me with quick steps and showered me with questions.

Since she was ‘pretending’ to be curious, I went along with it. In
reality, there was no curiosity or interest in her questions. It was
just an act to ease the other person’s mind.

Dorothy treated others in a friendly way, but despite how friendly she
appeared to be, she never opened her heart to another person. She wore
the mask of a smiling face and always drew an invisible boundary between
herself and others.

She was the exact opposite of Luce Eltania. While Luce was indifferent
to others, if she opened her heart, she would open it up completely.
This was because she didn’t know how to maintain a proper distance.

‘Whoa.’

*Snap.*

Dorothy leaned her face close to mine.

Startled, I reflexively jerked my head back.

She was always smiling, always trying to make everyone like her.
However, there were a lot of pretenses mixed into that smile.

Beneath the witch’s hat, her eyes, which appeared to hold the entire
universe, were staring into my own. It was as if they were trying to
penetrate my very soul.

It wasn’t an analogy. She really could see straight through my soul.

My passive skill that could be used thanks to the Abyssal Ring,
\[Psychological Insight\]. Dorothy could use a similar skill called
\[Emotional Insight\].

Fear, affection, longing, love, friendship, and more. She could tell
what emotions the person she was looking at was harboring towards her.

In addition, she also had a unique trait called \[All In The World\]
which allowed her to see into the essence of living things, though the
exact scope of this ability was not revealed in the game. It must have
been to add a sense of mystery to Dorothy.

Well, the ability to see into the essence of things came later in the
game. It was relegated to a basic skill for high-level characters.

“Do you know me?”

As expected, she could see right through me.

I wasn’t sure how my state of mind was being reflected to her, but it
wasn’t looking good.

I couldn’t just answer, ‘I know you because I played ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱’, so I decided to fake it a bit.

“Yes, because you are Senior Dorothy.”

“Hmmm.”

Dorothy tilted her head as if I didn’t give a very satisfactory answer.

In hindsight, her reaction made sense. It would be strange if I didn’t
know Dorothy Heartnova from Märchen Academy. There must have been a
deeper meaning to her question.

She was my favorite character. In other words, there was a high
possibility that my feelings were seen as something like ‘affection,’
which was a pretty big deal.

In Dorothy’s situation, it would be strange to see those emotions in
someone she never met before.

If so, what would be an appropriate answer?

‘Maybe I should say something like this.’

It didn’t take me long to come up with something I knew Dorothy would
like.

“I’m a fan of Senior Dorothy.”

I said with a confident snort.

“Oh, really?”

Dorothy looked surprised.

She was an attention seeker who loved to stand out. It was called
*celebrity syndrome.*

She liked to stand out from the crowd, and that was why she always used
‘Starlight’ magic unconditionally when standing in front of people.

‘That’s why I like her.’

Dorothy was a named character, but wasn’t an official heroine. Even so,
my favorite character in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was definitely her.

When I was living exhausted from studying for exams, I felt like a
nobody with nothing special in this world.

It was an empty everyday life.

I would go to the study room at dawn when the sky was not yet bright and
when I left the study room, the stars embroidered in the night sky would
welcome me.

It was because of such an insignificant daily life and routine that
Dorothy, a person who wanted to shine and reveal herself wherever she
was, resonated so strongly with me.

***You don’t know how much strength I’ve gotten from thinking about
you.***

“Hmm, I see. A fan of mine\~”

Dorothy stepped back, closed her eyes, and nodded as she cleared her
throat. She looked embarrassed. That was a genuine reaction, I knew it
because I’d seen it in the game.

Thus, fans were the best being to disarm Dorothy.

It was a situation where the person concerned could even read my
feelings. There would be no doubt about the answer that I was her fan.

“If I have a fan in the first year, doesn’t that mean I already have a
fan club?!”

“…Yes?”

***Does that exist…?***

***…No wait, is it actually real?***

“Ahhh, what the heck. Can I have a fan meeting? The time has finally
come for my autograph to shine!”

Dorothy’s thoughts quickly escalated, and excitedly counted on a fan
meeting happening before it was even certain.

Still, she was cute, so I just watched her in silence.

It was as if my daughter, who hadn’t even graduated from kindergarten
yet, revealed her aspirations, saying, *‘I will become a celebrity when
I grow up’,* and she seemed already worried about a fan meeting. How
could that not be cute?

Of course, I had never been married, so I didn’t truly know the feelings
of a parent, but I still felt that way anyways.

“Who’s the president?”

“For the first year, me.”

“Eh? Is it already divided into grade years…?”

I didn’t know. In the first place, even if there was such a thing as a
fan club, I was just trying to be nice.

I had no clue about the other years, but I was pretty sure I was the
No.1 fan of Dorothy in the first year.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ Yeah, I had a lot of experience.

“I mean, that autograph.”

I decided to get her autograph in order to follow Dorothy’s rhythm.

I took out a piece of parchment from the class materials I had brought
to review and handed it to Dorothy.

She giggled, took out a quill pen, and scribbled her autograph on the
parchment.

I got it back.

It was just scribbles.

“Nihihi, nice to meet you!”

“I’m happy that you’re happy. Nice to meet you too.”

“Look at the way you talk\~ It’s so cute! Nyahaha!”

Dorothy smiled broadly. Just looking at her smile made me feel good.

“Oh right. I’m taking time away from your training, president.”

“Ah, it’s okay.”

“Mmm! That’s right. Since you are my fan, just looking at my face will
recharge your energy, right?”

I wish that would give me strength.

Because otherwise, it seemed like I was going to fall behind in
training.

“Just kidding\~ I have to go now. Train hard!”

“Ah, yes!”

Dorothy turned to the side and started to walk away, waving her hand at
me as she did so.

Then, when her figure disappeared into the trees and out of sight, my
expression melted.

“It was a nice sight.”

She was really nice and pretty. Why was Dorothy not an official heroine?

That was my biggest complaint in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. If Dorothy
had a lover’s ending, I would have spent two-thirds of my ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱ playing time on her route.

‘Anyway…’

It was time to focus again. Regardless of the nice experience just now,
it was time to get back on track and concentrate on training.

Now that I had gotten a bit stronger, it would be better to go to the
training ground for a while and work on increasing my \[Elemental
Synergy\] as well…

“President!”

“……!”

Dorothy’s cheerful voice hit my ears.

Turning my head in the direction of her voice, I saw Dorothy’s peeking
her head out from behind a tree.

She still had a big smile on her face.

“What’s your name?”

Ah, my name.

“It’s Isaac.”

“Yes, Isaac! See you again tomorrow!”

“Yes… huh?”

See you again ‘tomorrow’?

Just as I was about to ask why tomorrow, Dorothy waved her hand and
walked away, her feet imbued with starlight mana.

A cluster of colorful lights floated for a moment in her wake and then
faded away.

“Tomorrow?”

What, all of a sudden?

It felt like a nuance that said *‘You must see me tomorrow’.*

***Because I’m a fan? No wait, I am a fan, but…***

“…”

I pondered, trying to figure out what Dorothy meant. However, thinking
that it was a waste of time, I decided to focus on my training again.

***If she really does come tomorrow, I’ll have to ask tomorrow.***

\* \* \*

“That’s interesting. It’s the first time I’ve seen anything like this…”

The silver-blue haired man who had been training a while ago.

He was hiding something sinister that even Dorothy Heartnova had never
seen before.

Her unique trait, \[All In The World\], allowed her to see through the
essence of everything under the heavens. Using this power, Dorothy saw
the essence of the man named Isaac as soon as she saw him.

Inside his essence was an enormous existence, capable of swallowing
everything in the world.

The Unknown.

It was an existence that could only be described with that expression,
and its identity was completely unknown.

It was something of immense size and looked terrifyingly ferocious – a
mass of near-infinite mana that defied providence.

Its countless eyes all stared at Dorothy in unison, each one giving her
a strong sense of oppression.

It made her feel as though she were an insignificant being.

And then it spoke to her.

──── \[ ■ ■■■ ■■■■■, ■■ ■■ ■■■? \]

It sounded like high frequency, but Dorothy could instinctively grasp
the meaning of those words.

It must have meant something like *‘You are looking at me with your bare
eyes, do you want to die?’.*

For a brief moment, she was scared.

It was fascinating that she felt fear simply because of something hidden
in the essence of human nature.

Moreover, the giant thing had been completely assimilated by Isaac. It
belonged entirely to him.

When it starts to rage, Isaac would be able to wield immense power.

She didn’t know how strong he would become, but it was probably beyond
her imagination.

In short, Isaac seemed like a mild-mannered student on the outside who
was simply being sincere.

But in reality.

“A monster.”

Dorothy’s lips curled into a wry smile.

She had heard rumors of the so-called geniuses among the first years,
like Luce Eltania and Kaya Astrean. Looking back, they were definitely
talented. Especially Luce Eltania, who seemed to have the potential to
reach the top in no time.

Even so, it was clear that if Isaac used his original power, they would
not be able to withstand it, even if all of the first-year students,
including the girls, attacked him.

Besides, if Isaac could borrow that power at will, he could easily
surpass even Dorothy herself, who was called a genius among geniuses.

In conclusion, Isaac was not an easy opponent, even for the person
called Dorothy.

He was the person who might become the strongest in the academy.

“As expected of Märchen Academy. This is why I like this place\~”

There was a reason why it was called the most prestigious academy on the
continent.

With the power of \[All In The World\], she thought that she had reached
the point where she knew everything. There was nothing more to be
interested in.

But now, something new and mysterious had appeared…

It was fun.

Dorothy smiled brightly and walked across the academy ground with light
steps, hopping like a rabbit while doing so.

She decided to observe Isaac for the time being.

-   ·····

It was the middle of the night.

The sky was filled with rain clouds, making even the moonlight
invisible.

High above the ceiling of the tall Kalis Hall, a demon clad in black was
sitting on the railing, watching the surrounding landscape.

His grayish-brown hair cascaded neatly down his back. His face showed a
hint of mischief, and his physique was dwarfed. Strictly speaking, he
was a human male, but his skin was a dull gray.

A \[Black Flame Curtain\] made up of black flames surrounded him. As
soon as the raindrops hit the curtain, they evaporated and disappeared.

The demon hummed a song as he swung his outstretched legs back and forth
in front of the railing.

He was scanning the surroundings with his two pairs of eyes, looking up
and down on both sides.

Earlier, he had come here to catch some fresh air after talking with
Alice Carroll, the student council president of Märchen Academy…

\[Hmm?\]

…When a unique sight caught the demon’s eye.

Far away, a man in a navy-blue tracksuit was running across the academy
grounds, with \[Ice Curtain\] wrapped around his body.

It would be understandable for someone from the Knight Department to be
running in such bad weather, but the tracksuit clearly belonged to the
Magic Department.

The demon studied the man. Thanks to his excellent eyesight, he could
easily make out the man’s features, no matter how far away he was.

\[Ah, he’s that Grade-E.\]

The demon spoke in a low voice.

Silver hair with a slightly bluish tint and crimson eyes.

Thanks to the student council president, the demon had memorized
everything after looking at the academy’s student record and the results
of mana evaluation (which was public information).

He recognized the silver-blue haired man who was running at once.

The lowest rank that was rated as Grade-E in terms of mana. It was
Isaac, a commoner and the man who was said to be the weakest in the
academy.

\[You’re a fool, you’re a fool. You’re not at the bottom of the first
grade for nothing. Try exercising in this weather for a hundred days, a
thousand days, and see if your mana goes up or not\].

The demon giggled. Isaac looked pathetic. No wonder he had a miserable
life at the bottom.

He would be much better off at the training grounds, practicing his
magic, instead of running around in the rain.

\[Ah, I want to play with you\~ If I see something weak, I just want to
crush it\~\]

The demon swayed his upper body from side to side and fell into agony.
Should he harass that jogger or not?

…He gave up. After all, that guy was in the first year. Before the start
of the dueling evaluation, he shouldn’t disrupt the schedule by doing
something so conspicuous.

On the day of the PvP performance evaluation in the first year of the
Magic Department, the demon planned to murder all the students. First he
would imprison all the students with the 8-star magic \[Fictional Hell\]
and play a large-scale death game.

***Let’s hold on until that day. Suppress your desire to torment and
kill humans. So that when the planned day finally arrives, you’ll feel
even more exhilarated.***

\[Come quickly, that day\~\]

Suddenly, one day, he remembered the mission he had received from the
evil god, Nephid. It was an instinctive feeling.

──‘Kill the Child of Light.’

The *‘Child of Light’* was a man named ‘Ian Fairytale’ right here at
Märchen Academy. The light element had a property that made demons
fearful, so it was easy to distinguish.

If possible, it would be better to deal with the demons and the
troublemaker who were roaming around all at once.

Ah, he was looking forward to it. The thought that he would be able to
play with the *Child of Light*, that troublemaker, and the many students
all with his own hands, before mercilessly killing them.

The Demon, ‘Leafa the Illusive’.

That night was gradually drawing closer.

Chapter 26: - Dueling Application
=================================

༺ **Dueling Application**༻

There was an anomaly in the familiar landscape.

“You don’t have to worry about me\~”

The sun was shining in the afternoon.

Today we had the last class off, so I went to the corner of the garden
earlier than usual to practice my magic.

Suddenly, Dorothy Heartnova jumped out of the trees.

She decided to lean against the tree behind me and watch me train.

However, the fact that someone was watching me made it difficult for me
to concentrate on my training.

‘How can I not care?’

I wondered if she realized I was uncomfortable, as she began to read a
book she got from who knows where.

Even if she was reading a book, the mere fact that she was there made me
uneasy.

“…Senior, are you going to stay here forever?”

“Yeah, because I’m bored.”

“Why are you here?”

“Mm, because I’m bored.”

“Then why did you ask to see me today…”

“Hmm, because I’m bored.”

Dorothy gave a weak answer that didn’t really explain anything at all,
while reading the book. I wondered if she was going to keep answering
that way, so I asked, *‘What are you having for dinner tonight?*’, and
heard the normal answer of *‘chicken’.*

Anyway… As a junior and a fan, I couldn’t say anything.

***Self hypnosis. Let’s ignore Dorothy.*** Even if she did come into
view, I would just regard her as another piece of the landscape. Then it
would work somehow.

“Whew.”

I took a deep breath while conjuring \[Frostfire\] in both hands, and
began to intently focus on my training again.

…Forty minutes later. The time when the sky was dyed by the color of the
sunset.

“Ugh…”

Blood flowed out from my nose. My whole body began to violently ache,
and my magic output was becoming erratic. In addition, even the
slightest use of magic triggered a strong rejection from within my body.

It was now a daily routine.

If I pushed myself a little harder at this point, I would get stronger.

It was the same logic as strength training when you feel like you
couldn’t do it anymore, but then you did one more rep and your muscles
would stretch.

Today, as I mainly used spells with high mana consumption, it seemed
that I had reached my limit earlier than usual.

I wiped the blood from my nose and got into a preparatory stance to cast
a spell.

“Are you okay?”

“…!”

Dorothy, who suddenly came beside me, asked. Startled, I spun around to
find her staring at me from up close.

“Don’t push yourself too hard. Won’t you damage your mana circuit
otherwise?”

Dorothy smiled softly and began to wipe the bridge of my nose with her
handkerchief.

It was a kind and gentle touch.

I was dumbfounded, so I just stood there and watched her in silence.

“Do you usually do this?”

“Oh, yeah. I guess so, huh?”

“Mmm.”

When Dorothy finished wiping my nosebleed, she took the handkerchief
back. The pink handkerchief was stained with red bloodstains.

Then, suddenly, green mana began to flow from the side of my chest. It
appeared to be coming from Dorothy’s outstretched hand.

‘Oh, what?’

Suddenly, I felt a surge of strength, and the stiffness in my body
disappeared in an instant!

“A buff. I used just enough so that your body won’t be overwhelmed
tomorrow\~”

***Woah, isn’t this the best? I feel like I’ve just gotten a caffeine
fix after studying and my mind was flashing.***

I could be a little more intense with my training today!

“You can’t overdo it, President, okay?”

…As if she could read my mind.

“Thank you, Senior.”

“Hehe, resume training!”

*Slap—!*

Dorothy laughed and slapped me hard on the back, then headed back to the
tree that she was leaning against.

Ah, that hurt a bit you know, but… Anyway, thanks to you, it was a big
help.

If Dorothy was around every time I trained, I wonder if it would be okay
to get some more buffs.

I wouldn’t say anything overtly, but I thought it would be a good idea
to ask for it when the opportunity arises.

\* \* \*

There was something out of place in the familiar landscape.

Luce Eltania was watching the silver-blue haired man training in the
corner of the garden.

She was seated on a stone wall. It was quite the distance from the
garden’s corner, with trees obscuring the view. Nonetheless, she had no
trouble keeping an eye on the man with silver-blue hair.

This area was sparsely populated, so she hadn’t seen anyone come and go
for a while. It was one of the best vantage points.

The silver-blue haired man seemed to have improved his magic proficiency
since the last time she saw him. It was a remarkable rate of growth.

Every time she looked at him, she felt a strange stimulus. It made her
want to work harder and harder herself, and maybe that was why she
couldn’t help being mesmerized by his hard work.

He was the reason why she had recently become passionate about her
lightning magic.

“···Eh?”

But at some point, a woman appeared on the other side – a woman with
light purple hair wearing a witch’s hat. Upon closer inspection with her
excellent eyesight, she was wearing a blue brooch on her academy uniform
ribbon; she was a Senior in the second-year.

The woman chatted affectionately with the silver-blue haired man, then
leaned against a tree behind him and began to watch him practice from
her special seat.

‘Who is that person?’

Luce had never seen such a person before.

Was she a friend of the silver-blue haired man? Or maybe his lover?

She had no idea, but the women appeared to be interested in him,
although Luce couldn’t tell if the interest stemmed from friendship, a
crush, or something entirely different.

But the way she wiped his nose with a handkerchief was certainly
unusual.

“Hmm.”

For the man to have a lover was a matter of little concern. She just
wondered if it would be impolite to observe.

As she watched the scene quietly, memories from her childhood suddenly
flashed in front of Luce’s eyes.

─ ‘Gretel, look at this! Yap!’

─ ‘It’s cool, big brother…!’

A poor family.

The figure of a young older brother who wielded a wooden stick like a
sword and the image of herself as a child, sitting against a tree and
admiring him endlessly.

Her former name, which she had already thrown away along with the past.

Once again, her heart sank as she sifted through her memories.

“…….”

Luce gently closed her eyes.

1, 2, 3.

Only 3 seconds.

That was how long it took her to bury the memories she didn’t want to
recall deep in her heart, and to put her feelings under wraps.

\* \* \*

“I will announce the contents of the next performance evaluation.”

The next morning, inside the *Class D* classroom.

Professor Fernando stood at the podium and started making announcements
to the students.

The students were taken aback as this was the first time the contents of
the performance evaluation were announced from the beginning, since it
had never been revealed before.

The time had come. It was something that must take place every semester.

“‘Duel’. A one-on-one fight. We plan to evaluate your combat sense and
practical skills in combat.”

Duel. As soon as they heard that, some students rejoiced and exclaimed,
*‘The time has finally come,’* while others despised it.

If I had to ask, I was happy. This duel evaluation would be a good
indicator to judge how strong I had become.

‘I’m confident.’

I was now able to use both offensive and defensive magic spells. I could
even use the 5-star spell \[Frost Explosion\].

My confidence soared. Comparing myself now with the time of the class
placement evaluation. Ah, how amazing I am now!

“The ticket I just handed out is to apply for duel. Take two each.”

Two small tickets floated next to Professor Fernando. They floated with
the help of telekinesis magic.

In my pocket were the two dueling application tickets that had been
distributed earlier.

“You can use one ticket to challenge the opponent you want. If the other
party accepts, the duel will proceed on the day of the performance
evaluation. If the other party refuses, the spent dueling application
right is returned to the person concerned and that is the end.”

And that wasn’t all.

“However, if you use two tickets to request a duel, the opponent must
unconditionally accept it.”

To get a high score from the judges during the duel, it was best to
demonstrate a variety of combat methods. Therefore, the dueling
performance evaluation was structured in which it was advantageous to
receive good grades as the number of duels you participated in
increased.

The only time a student would use up two tickets to request a duel was
if they really wanted to fight a specific opponent. The academy made the
mandatory duel rule to respect the student’s will.

By the way, Ian Fairytale used both of his tickets to challenge Luce
Eltania to a duel. His reasoning was that he wanted to fight the
strongest person. In a good way, it showed his spirit and passion; and
in a bad way, it showed his recklessness and bravado.

Still, since he was the protagonist, it worked out. When I was playing
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it was one of those scenes that made me
think, *‘Oh, if you’re the main character, you have to have this level
of ambition.’*

“Each person can engage in up to 4 duels. If you have a good opponent,
it would be better to apply as soon as possible.”

This rule was implemented so there wouldn’t be a backlog.

“Applying for a duel only needs to be done between first-year students
of the Magic Department. Classes are irrelevant. However, if a
high-ranking student wins a match against a low-ranking student, the
score will be reduced by the difference in mana and grade. Conversely,
if a lower-ranking student wins a match against a higher-ranking
student, he or she will get a large number of points.”

Because of these rules, most people would only duel students in their
own class. They would be too scared to pick a fight with a student in a
higher class than themselves, and they don’t get points for picking a
fight with a student in a lower class.

That was why it was unusual for Ian to request a duel with Luce.

“Once you’ve decided on an opponent, report to me. For now, I will leave
this time slot empty. Move only within Orphin Hall. Do as you please,
but focus on gathering your opponents. Over.”

The moment Professor Fernando finished making the announcement.

*Bang-!*

The door slammed open, and the gazes of Professor Fernando and the Class
D students turned toward the door in unison.

A confident voice followed.

“Ha! This is the Class D! So this is what the air at the bottom feels
like!”

Suddenly, the door burst open and the person who appeared was Tristan
Humphrey, a conceited blond aristocrat.

Long time no see. I had been dying to do something with him since the
class placement evaluation.

“Tristan Humphrey?”

“He’s from the upper classes, isn’t he?”

“Why would someone like that be here…?”

Tristan was at the top of Class B. Maybe that was why all the students
seemed intrigued and fearful at the same time.

“There you are.”

Tristan looked around at the students, then his eyes fixed on me.

He charged toward me at a brisk pace.

What the…?

“I, a nobleman, challenge you, a lowly Grade E commoner, to a duel.”

*Bang-*

He slammed his hand on the desk in front of me and flashed me an
arrogant smile.

“Be grateful.”

You bastard, were you waiting…?

“What? Did you just ask for a duel with a Grade E?”

“There’s no merit at all… How much do you hate him?”

“When did you get on Tristan’s bad side, dude?”

“Of course he’s going to refuse, right? How can a Grade E beat him?”

Professor Fernando’s eyes were filled with intrigue amidst the students’
interest and whispers.

Tristan smiled as he stared at me steadfastly.

He seemed very happy at the thought of beating me up already.

I wonder how frustrated I would have been if he managed to beat me up
that time during the class placement evaluation…

Still, I had to say that I was glad that he was trying to legitimately
harass me through the curriculum.

“…”

*…Wait a minute.*

***Wait a minute, wait a minute.***

Lately, I think I’ve gotten a little cocky from hunting demons and
fighting demonic creature illusions, but wasn’t this a sign of trouble?

Although Tristan was much weaker than the demons I fought so far, he was
still much stronger than me.

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 76

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Delighted at the thought of beating you up.\]

I wonder when he leveled up like this. He was probably level 71 last
time.

Of course, he wouldn’t have stayed still after being beaten by me. Given
his personality, he definitely put in significant effort to get
stronger. He must have learned defensive magic as well.

‘…I’m in big trouble.’

***I’ll be damned…***

“I won’t take no for an answer! Hahahaha─!”

Tristan laughed, taking out two tickets and throwing them at me.

The thin sheets of paper brushed past my cheek and fell onto my lap.

“…”

***…You’re really trying to make me lose it, aren’t you?***

***Even if it means stepping on horse shit, I’m definitely going to beat
the shit out of this guy.***

**T/N: Isaac referred to ‘Duel’ as PvP until now because of his
background as a gamer, but the official term within the world is ‘Duel’,
which he began using last chapter.**

<span id="0026_27_-_Duel_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 27: - Duel (1)
======================

༺ **Duel (1)**༻

“The duel evaluation will now commence.”

The day had finally arrived.

‘Duke Hall’, an arena dedicated to the first-year students in the Magic
Department. The interior of the spacious building was divided into four
equal sections, each of which contained its own arena.

The first-year students of the Magic Department were divided into four
groups and each moved into a different arena.

I was in Group A. I recognized Luce, Ian, Mateo, and Tristan among the
many students, but Kaya and Amy seemed to have gone to another group.

Next to the arena, there was a judging stand with middle-aged wizards
sitting side by side in their seats. They were all presiding judges.

“The rules are simple. You win when your opponent is unable to continue,
or by forcing them to surrender. However, please note that surrender is
not possible during the first minute of the duel. Due to the nature of
this performance evaluation, no sudden actions are authorized. Be aware
that you may be restrained by the proctors.”

In the arena, Professor Fernando, along with his zombie-like teaching
assistant Marco, and an associate professor, were giving the students a
briefing on the performance evaluation.

“The only time you are allowed to run amok is during the duel. We have
the best medical staff and clerics are on standby, so focus on showing
your full capabilities. That is all.”

Professor Fernando finished his brief explanation and walked out of the
arena.

Then, the associate professor called out the first rounds of students
who were going to face off.

Mateo Jordana and a student I had never seen before stepped into the
arena, and when the referee called out*, ‘match start,’* the match
began.

\[Mateo Jordana\] **Lv:** 80

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to catch up to you.\]

Mateo had grown considerably in my absence.

Hmph, he’s been working hard to target me… I may be caught in the act
sooner or later.

‘What should I do about Tristan?’

Even though I promised myself that I would beat the shit out of Tristan
no matter what, after he humiliated me, it was an undeniable fact that
he outclassed me in terms of strength.

Besides, I didn’t even know how he honed his skills.

The conflict between Ian Fairytale and Tristan Humphrey in ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱ was during the Familiar Summoning. At that time, Ian lightly
knocked down Tristan and refreshingly blasted him. After that, Tristan
also began to learn defensive magic.

But I had already provoked him during the class placement evaluation. It
wouldn’t be strange if he had properly learned defensive magic by now.

Even if Tristan was a conceited person, I had to give him credit for his
offensive magic. If he could defend as well as he attacked, I would be
out of luck.

So I had to defeat him with a single move. Otherwise, I would be
defeated unconditionally.

“…?”

Huh?

Professor Fernando whispered something to the assistant professor and
then quickly stepped out into the hallway.

His usual poker face seemed shaken…

‘Well, it’s probably nothing.’

I calmed down my anxiety that briefly rose.

That was because nothing serious would happen in this dueling chapter,
nothing that could be called a crisis anyway.

Maybe he ate something wrong or needed to use the restroom in a hurry.

“Mateo Jordana, wins!”

Mateo easily subdued his opponent with rock magic.

After the duel, the judges gave their feedback.

Most of them had things to say regarding Mateo’s wits, things to praise,
and things to work on, but one judge had some harsh words.

“It’s pathetic. Your proficiency in rock magic is very low. Rock is an
element that can be shaped at a moment’s notice, which means you need to
be able to sculpt rock forms with forethought and precision in combat.
And yet, do you know anything other than violent battles? No wonder your
skills are only at a Class B level. Must be because you’re a commoner…”

Oh, that one. I knew who he was.

A middle-aged man with red hair. An openly discriminatory professor.

It was Professor Philip, who was in charge of Class A.

\[Philip Meltron\] **Lv:** 108

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Displeased because a commoner has defeated a noble.\]

He was a professor with a notorious reputation, but his skills were
certain. He treated nobles well, meaning there was little reason to
dislike him if you were a noble.

Mateo clenched his fists and trembled, then calmed down.

“Thank you for your feedback.”

Mateo bowed his head and calmly accepted Professor Philip’s feedback.
Contrary to how one would expect, his obedient demeanor seemed to have
angered Professor Philip.

Mateo was determined to prove his worth through his skills. He was
confident that he would be as solid as a rock regardless of the
challenges he would have to face, and Professor Philip’s provocation
wouldn’t faze him.

“Next! Isaac from Class D, and Tristan Humphrey from Class B, come
forward!”

It was my turn now.

***Whew.*** After taking a deep breath, I stepped up.

When it was my turn, the stadium looked bigger than ever. Perhaps
because of my nervousness, my heart was racing wildly.

I slowly made my way up the stairs and into the arena. On the other
side, Tristan Humphrey, the conceited blond aristocrat, was grinning as
he approached.

We faced each other at a distance, with the referee in between us.

“…?”

It was then that the system window appeared in front of me.

\[A demon has been detected nearby.\]

*Huuueeeeeeeee*─

Suddenly, I heard the sound of the wind in my head, and it felt as if my
heart was being pulled upwards.

I reflexively raised my head.

Above the high ceilings, I could sense an intense energy from beyond.

At the same time, information about the demon that was probably on the
roof appeared before my eyes.

\[Leafa the Illusive\] **Lv:** 130

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** Very High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to kill all students, including you.\]

Was this part of 「Act 3, Chapter 1, Duel」 of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱…?

‘What’s going on…?’

The final boss of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 6, Chapter 3,
Fictional Hell」, Leafa the Illusive.

He still had a long way to go before appearing… Why was he here
already…?

\* \* \*

Under the clear sky, the wind whipped through the rooftops of Duke Hall.

‘Leafa the Illusive’, a dwarf-sized demon with grey-brown hair, was
leaning against the railing and staring down at the ground.

The roof floor was carved with a large magic circle that emitted a faint
purple light.

But Leafa’s interest laid beyond that.

With his unique skill \[Clairvoyance\], he could see through nearby
places and now, with the power of \[Clairvoyance\], he gazed beyond the
roof floor and into the interior of a certain building.

It was an arena divided into four areas. While each student was engaged
in a duel, no student stood out yet.

\[No troublemakers yet\~\]

Leafa spoke in a bored voice, like a mischievous child.

A troublemaker who went around slaying demons. He had yet to see anyone
who could be the slayer, but when he did, he intended to play a death
game centered around that person and Ian Fairytale.

The participants would be every first-year student of the Magic
Department present at Duke Hall. The boring judges were a bonus.

\[Soon, very soon.\]

***I’ll trap all of them with my magic, and let Ian Fairytale and that
troublemaker protect the people. Ah, that will be fun.***

Leafa giggled. The heightened anticipation was filling him with ecstasy.

It was then.

*Kik*─

The roof door opened, revealing a stoic-looking man. Silver hair and
blue eyes – it was Professor Fernando Frost.

Leafa’s eyes turned to Fernando.

“A demon…?”

Fernando’s eyes narrowed as he glared at Leafa cynically.

Leafa grinned from ear to ear. He hadn’t expected a professor to show up
here.

\[What are you doing, Professor\~? Aha, you were in the middle of the
first-years Dueling Evaluation of the Magic Department, right?\]

“…”

\[It was forbidden to enter Duke Hall! Alas, I forgot, I forgot! I’m
sorry\~\]

Leafa answered like a little child, but he didn’t show any sign of
remorse.

“You spoke…?”

What surprised Fernando was that Leafa spoke like a normal human being.

Demons were inherently less intelligent and were known to be unable to
have normal conversations.

\[But what happened? Didn’t you only net inside of the building? Aha, I
guess you extended it outside of the building this time? It was too
much\~\]

“···Where did you hear that?”

Normally, when a test or a performance evaluation took place inside a
building, Fernando would set up a net using telekinesis magic throughout
the building. It was a kind of barrier. Therefore, if an abnormality
occurred, Fernando would immediately notice it.

However, only key groups within the academy were aware of that fact. The
faculty, the Four Constellations, and the student council.

“Do you have a mole?”

\[Kuhuhu.\]

Leafa only laughed with his characteristic cackle, but did not respond.
As if he didn’t need to answer.

The implication was clear.

‘You’re going to die here anyway.’

“What are you planning?”

Fernando held out his right index finger toward Leafa. Water mana and
ice mana flowed out in front of his finger and compressed into a small
round ball and formed a bullet.

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1)」 + 「Ice Generation (Ice
Element, ★1 )」 + 「Compression (Neutral Element, ★4)」

= 「Elemental Magic Bullet (Water+Ice Element)」

\[Oh my, calm down, calm down\~ Let’s talk peacefully.\]

“That’s quite a thing to say.”

The magic circle engraved on the rooftop was in the form of jumbled
strokes that tangled here and there.

He had memorized almost every circle. That was why Fernando had a strong
feeling that this ominous and unknown magic circle was extremely
dangerous.

No mana was detected from it. Maybe it hadn’t been activated yet.

No, normally, when a magic circle was about to be activated, shouldn’t
some amount of magic power be felt…?

\[Haah, I didn’t want to be interrupted. Still, I suppose you could be
an appetizer if nothing else!\]

“…!”

With the demon’s shrill voice, the purple light emitting from the magic
circle became more intense.

Then, a blackish yet bizarre mana spread out in an instant, swallowing
Leafa and Fernando in one fell swoop…

\[Have fun, Fernando Frost.\]

…And a circular purple space was created on the roof, \[Fictional
Hell\].

The natural mana floating in the air was sucked in, and a new world that
was disconnected from the laws of nature, the principles of this
world—Providence, was created.

Fernando was forcibly invited into such a world.

Chapter 28: - Duel (2)
======================

༺ **Duel (2)**༻

Leafa the Illusive, the final boss of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act
6, Chapter 3, Fictional Hell」.

His current level was lower than I knew, but it was clear who he was by
looking at his elements.

There was no way he would appear so early. Act 6, Chapter 3 was in the
second semester of the first year. It meant that fighting Leafa was
still a long way off.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, during the ‘Four Constellations’ part of
the 2nd semester of the 1st year, Leafa transformed into a human and
became friends with Ian Fairytale’s party. He was able to disguise
himself and infiltrate the academy by altering people’s perception with
illusion and perception type magic.

If you were a player who hadn’t been spoiled, you would have thought
*‘that’s a new character’*‘ when seeing Leafa for the first time and
moved on. I was like that at first too.

However, as we entered Act 6, Chapter 3, it was revealed that the Leafa
was a demon, and the battle to subdue Leafa began. At that time, his
level was 150. I remember the difficulty level being horrendous.

***I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a story twist that big before.***

This meant that something I didn’t know about triggered Leafa’s
appearance.

Leafa the Illusive was a demon who had been manifesting in this world
for quite some time. It could be seen as one of the few demons who
adapted to life in this world with its own intelligence.

So, even though he was tasked with the mission of killing Ian Fairytale,
a light element user, he was capable of demonstrating ‘caution’.

I quickly racked my brain.

The reason why he appeared early, what was it?

‘…No way?’

With a little thought, I was able to figure it out.

He had a close relationship with Alice Carroll, the student council
president of Märchen Academy, and a shadowy figure with her own agenda
who was manipulating events behind the scenes. It was a shallow
alliance, since they could betray each other at any time, and would be
more appropriate to define it as friendship.

In the original story, it was self-evident that the man dealing with the
demons was Ian Fairytale. So Alice or Leafa simply had to watch Ian’s
every move. Even if Ian was a member of the Fairytale family, he could
still be trapped and killed at the right time.

However, it was currently unknown who the Demon Hunter was. Alice must
have been desperate to find me. It was highly likely that Leafa was also
interested in the unknown entity after seeing his reaction.

That was why he probably couldn’t overcome his curiosity and appeared
now.

Since the troublemaker first appeared during the class placement
evaluation for the Magic Department, they were likely a student in the
Magic Department.

This duel evaluation allowed him to gauge the strength of the first-year
students of the Magic Department. It was a golden opportunity to find
out who that person was.

‘But this is too fast.’

The story has just entered Act 3, Chapter 1, and the final boss of Act
6, Chapter 3 had already appeared…

Still, Leafa’s level was only 130. There would be no problem with
fighting him one-on-one, but Leafa’s specialty was more than just simple
confrontation.

It was not like Leafa’s subjugation happened for nothing. The stage for
fighting him was \[Fictional Hell\], an 8-star magic capable of
destroying an entire country; a magic that creates a world that ignored
the laws of this world and transcended the concept of illusions, even
though it was a type of illusion itself.

It was a unique magic that no one else could copy.

It didn’t emit mana, but rather absorbed mana around it into its own
world, so you couldn’t even sense it. Just like how a black hole absorbs
light and becomes invisible.

Leafa was *Absolute* inside, akin to *God* playing around in a world of
magic that was entirely his domain.

If you didn’t know the ‘strategy’, even a level 180 giant like Dorothy
Heartnova would have a hard time defeating Leafa with \[Fictional Hell\]
activated. I didn’t want him to become a god.

By the way, dying in that world meant losing your soul. You would become
a human vegetable.

The ‘normal’ strategy was to not get caught in the \[Fictional Hell\].

‘Ah, what should I do?’

He likes to toy with humans and in case he finds the troublemaker, he
would most likely trap them at Duke Hall and suck them into \[Fictional
Hell\] and play a game of death. Ian would most likely struggle to keep
the people safe.

So what should I do now?

“Ha! Are you praying to the heavens? Too bad! You can’t see the sky from
here!”

*Hahahaha!* Tristan laughed loudly and then cleared his throat.

I lowered my head and looked at him.

I was not in a position to comfortably engage in a duel here. It wasn’t
a comfortable situation currently, but rather a crisis.

In any case, I need to get to the rooftops as soon as possible. But I
couldn’t just give up and run to the roof.

As Professor Fernando said earlier, the waiting proctors were expected
to subdue anyone who looked suspicious.

Because the duel evaluation encouraged students to fight, there were
times when the adrenaline rush could sometimes get the better of them.

Those who acted unexpectedly were therefore reprimanded and then
questioned about why they didn’t follow the rules. And if that happened
to me, I couldn’t say how long it would take.

I wouldn’t be free until the duel was over, and then I would have to
hear feedback from the judges.

Furthermore, I cannot surrender during the first minute of the duel. I
couldn’t just give up and leave right away.

Even if I decide to surrender, Tristan’s magic would wreck me in that
one minute. He looked like he was determined to beat me to death.

And if I got beaten by Tristan, I wouldn’t be able to go defeat Leafa
the Illusive.

‘What if I were to challenge Leafa directly at this moment?’

The \[Hunter\] trait would activate and I would become stronger. But,
unless I wanted to be openly caught by Alice Carroll, it was probably
best to refrain from such ignorant behavior in front of the other
students.

No matter how secretly the performance evaluation or exam is conducted,
there was no stopping the word of mouth.

‘Then the only option left is…

It was the best option.

I made my decision and glared straight at Tristan.

“The means are unlimited. No surrendering for the first minute. Now,
show your opponent some respect and get ready for the duel. Ready…!
Begin duel!”

After the referee gave his instructions, he shouted and fell back.

The duel with Tristan had begun.

“Kuhhhh! I’ve been waiting for this moment! This time I can ruthlessly
cut off that ugly face of yours with my magic!”

I ignored whatever he said. ***Stay focused.*** I couldn’t afford to
make a mistake here. Level, mana – he was much better than me in all
criteria. If we start exchanging blows, I would be screwed.

***Let’s postpone assessing my current skills with pure magic to the
next duel.***

For now, I should just focus on getting through this situation carefully
and quickly.

I wrapped ice mana around my fingers and blasted it toward Tristan.

\* \* \*

Tristan was tormented by the painful memory of his defeat during the
class placement evaluation.

A mere commoner with only Grade E mana and no special skills. He was
defeated by his poor tactics and, for some reason, by Kaya Astrean as
well.

Tristan gritted his teeth.

Through his life, he had always been respected and held to high
standards.

Because he was special. Even at the prestigious Märchen Academy, he was
able to take the top rank in his class because he himself was a
competent person!

Therefore… it didn’t make sense for someone like him to lose to a Grade
E commoner. Even if something went wrong, it must have been seriously
wrong.

This time, he would use this opportunity to right that wrong, and make
it clear to Isaac that a Grade E commoner like him couldn’t even reach
his toes. During the class placement evaluation, he had only let his
guard down for a moment.

*Ddddddddd—!!*

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

A wall of ice rose from the ground in an instant, trapping Tristan from
all sides.

A trick to his eyes. Tristan channeled his mana into a sharp form,
carving a light green sword in the air.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

*Sasasasasasak—!*

The dense wind sliced through the \[Ice Wall\] as easily as if it were
cutting a cake and in the blink of an eye, the \[Ice Wall\] with several
hatches collapsed helplessly.

When the students saw a 3-star spell slice through a 4-star, especially
a defensive magic, with such ease at once, they exclaimed*, ‘As
expected.,’* as if it were only natural.

\[Elemental Firepower\] meant the power of magic, and it was an obvious
fact that Tristan, a top-ranked honor student, far surpassed the level
of Isaac, a low-ranked inferior student.

“Whew.”

As if he already knew his magic would be shattered disastrously, Isaac
threw out his next move as the ice wall collapsed,

‘Processed Fog’. A whitish fog emanated from the magic tool, enveloping
the arena.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

As the cold air released by Isaac cooled, the processed fog grew thicker
and turned into advection fog.

「Snow Pellets (Ice Element, ★2)」

In the fog, the magic that Isaac had learned specifically for the duel
evaluation, \[Snow Pellets\], pounded the arena mercilessly, dispersing
the sound.

It was a spell that created a large amount of small icicles in the air
and sent them crashing into the ground like hailstones.

The purpose was obvious – to make sure that no one could hear where he
was.

“Not again. Is this the only trick you can pull?”

***Of course, since that’s all I’m good for as a Grade E commoner!***

Tristan’s mouth curled into a sneer. He was starting to find that Grade
E commoner almost cute now.

Ever since the class placement evaluation, Tristan had been working hard
on his magic training. Now he was even capable enough to use defensive
magic at a decent level.

“Hiding like a coward.”

***Oh, so he’s trying to anger me again.***

***How shallow. You think I’m going to fall for your tactics twice!***

“Pathetic!”

Tristan stretched his right arm upward, casting wind magic.

A light green magic circle formed above the right hand, and the wind
mana began to swirl violently. The newly created whirlwind barrier
absorbed the dense fog.

「Wind Wall (Wind Element, ★4)」

*Huuueeeeeee─!*

*Ssshhhhhhhh─!*

“Ha! I, Tristan Humphrey, am getting stronger at every moment!”

The thick fog cleared, and the \[Snow Pellets\] were absorbed into the
whirlwind.

In a short period of time, as the fog cleared, the arena revealed itself
and soon, the figure of Isaac, who was running toward Tristan, was also
revealed.

As he ran, he put his fingers together, creating a gap between his hands
to gather ice mana.

‘Huh, what kind of athletic ability…?!’

***Almost there. I got here much faster than expected!***

Tristan quickly tried to retreat, but his feet wouldn’t move. In a
fleeting moment, he glanced down and saw that the soles of his shoes
were frozen.

It wasn’t just his shoes. The entire arena was covered in ice.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

‘When did he?!’

The ‘Processed Fog’ created by Isaac was of water element. Even if his
\[Elemental Firepower\] was insignificant, his \[Elemental Synergy\]
which enhanced the combination effect between elements, could not be
ignored.

Thus, it was possible for him to freeze the arena thick enough to trap
Tristan’s feet.

Before long, ice mana was gently condensed in Isaac’s hand. A pale blue
magic circle formed, following his hand.

Isaac clutched the mass of mana in his right hand and stretched it out
toward Tristan.

“You think you’re going to get away with this!?”

He didn’t know what kind of magic that was, but Tristan himself wasn’t
generous enough to tolerate it calmly.

Today would be the day Isaac would be beaten into dust. It would be a
day to unravel his own regrets.

Tristan released his whirlwind barrier \[Wind Wall\] and swung his left
arm, which was covered in wind mana, in one swift motion.

And at the same time, the light blue mana in Isaac’s grasp exploded
towards Tristan.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」 「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh───!!*

*Huuuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee───!!*

“Shut up!”

Tristan’s lone scream could be heard as an explosive flood of ice
attacked him.

The \[Whirlwind\] shattered the mass of ice that had formed in an
instant, sending large shards of ice scattering into the air. However,
the impact of the explosion had yet to be fully received.

A strong wind pressure was generated and the impact caused Isaac’s body
to bounce back like a ball. However, after rolling on the floor for a
while, Isaac got up without much difficulty.

“Whew.”

Tristan’s spell caused no damage because it did not directly touch him.
However, the wind pressure created by the collision of \[Frost
Explosion\] and \[Whirlwind\] only caused a brief pain in his abdomen,
it felt as if he had been punched in the stomach with a huge fist.

“How?”

“What? Did I misread that student’s information?”

There was a look of bewilderment and confusion in the judges’ eyes.

A Class D student, who was supposed to have Grade E mana, used 5-star
magic that most first-year students didn’t even have access too.

The judges began to sift through his information, reading the papers on
their desks once more to make sure if Isaac was indeed a Grade E, or if
they had misremembered.

The students watching the duel were also stunned, and soon started
talking with faces full of disbelief.

“What just happened…?”

“That was 5-star magic just now, wasn’t it…?”

“Isaac used 5-star magic? But he’s Grade E in mana, he…!”

The atmosphere centered around Isaac started to become chaotic. As for
Tristan, it was a very embarrassing situation for him.

His school uniform was tattered as if it had been pierced by numerous
thorns, and his body was covered in frostbite and bruises.

At least, the \[Whirlwind\] and \[Basic Protection Magic\] seemed to
have softened the impact of \[Frost Explosion\].

“Keukhuk…”

He groaned and staggered in pain before straightening up again and
glared at Isaac with a furious gaze.

At the same time, he activated \[Wind Sword\] and smashed the ice that
was binding his feet to the ground.

Because of the collision with \[Whirlwind\], he trampled on the remains
of the ice block that had been shattered into pieces. His anger was
fully expressed with that one step.

Amidst the calmly flowing cold air, he began to generate a strong wind.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

As if to represent Tristan’s anger, light green wind began to sweep
around the arena fiercely.

Then, a whirlwind began to form in his outstretched hands.

“A Grade E commoner… wounded me again…!”

“You let your guard down again, Tristan.”

“…?”

That was when Tristan, in a fit of rage, let his guard down and took an
offensive stance.

Isaac gently clenched his left hand, which was hidden behind his back,
into a fist.

The flow of mana in his left hand suddenly ceased.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

Before he knew it, a large block of ice that had formed above Tristan’s
head suddenly crashed down.

Crash*─*!

“Kaugh!”

The block of ice hit Tristan squarely on the head.

Amidst the screams of some startled female students, Tristan staggered
and fell to his knees on the ground, a chunk of ice rolling straight to
the ground.

Blood trickled down from his head. The colors present on his face were a
mix of his skin and red blood.

“Ah, ugh…!!”

Tristan stood up, gnashing his teeth to the point of making a clicking
noise.

“Ughhhhh!!!”

His anger exploded as if it would pierce the sky.

The damage he suffered this time was different from the class placement
evaluation. Thanks to \[Basic Protection Magic\] covering his entire
body, he was able to stand even after his head was directly hit by the
falling ice block. He only fainted, very briefly.

He shuddered and managed to get up, then stretched his right arm over
his head again.

A light green magic circle began to materialize in double and triple
layers. Tristan had often referred to his power as ‘dense, thick,
limitless mana’.

The wind whipped menacingly, a swirl of mana, ‘almighty,’ as he called
it, that would tear through someone straight to their bones.

Isaac no longer had a chance to win. He must now bear the wrath of the
conceited blond aristocrat who was covered in blood.

“Are you done already? Come on, it’s my turn. I am definitely going to
kill you, right here, right now!”

They say anger is a catalyst for an awakening and Tristan, who used his
anger as fuel, was unleashing a torrent of mana that could crush anyone.

The students watched and gulped without even realizing it. Even though
they were simply watching, they felt overwhelmed by the mana.

Isaac no longer had a chance to win. From now on, Tristan’s magic would
hack Isaac to pieces without mercy.

“Yes, I surrender.”

…That is, if the fight continues.

Isaac calmly lifted his arms up and said. Exactly one minute had elapsed
since the start of the duel, and a quick glance at the clock above the
judges’ heads could confirm this fact.

“…Huh?”

As if he’d heard something he shouldn’t have, Tristan’s expression was
tinged with astonishment.

Because he was so surprised, his concentration broke, his wind mana
dissipated, and the magic circles were dispelled.

“Student Isaac…? Are you aware that if you surrender, you’ll lose the
opportunity to get feedback from us…?”

“Yes, Mr. Judge. My opponent is too strong. Even though it’s a shame, I
will surrender…”

‘No, you can’t…!’

***Do not say that! The fight is just starting…!***

***Even though you lost, don’t put on a refreshing face as if you fought
well!***

“I lost. It was a good fight.”

Isaac lightly patted Tristan on the shoulder with a look of *‘I
acknowledge you’,* and walked away.

At that moment, time stood still for Tristan.

Chapter 29: - ■■el (3) - Fictional Hell
=======================================

༺ **■■el (3) – Fictional Hell**༻

In this awkward atmosphere, I hurriedly stepped out into the hallway.

The students had begun whispering about me.

Things like what was the reason for that, why did I start running away,
or why I didn’t just do that from the beginning, that I was a coward,
and so on.

Even though Luce didn’t care about anyone else, she was staring at me
rather attentively. Was I really that noticeable? Of course, from her
perspective, I was probably just a passing extra 1, maybe extra 4 at
best. Well, she would stop paying attention to me soon anyways.

Mateo nodded, a look of approval on his face. I didn’t want to read his
psychology because it was obvious that he was thinking something along
the lines of *‘Isaac adjusted his power to Tristan’s level.’*

‘Now is not the time to get distracted.’

As soon as I got to a place where people couldn’t see me, I started
running.

‘Come on…!’

Normally, it would take me quite a while to get to the roof.
Fortunately, my stamina was in good condition. I could reach the rooftop
by running at full speed without stopping.

Predictably, there was a high possibility that the Leafa the Illusive
intended to confine the entire Duke Hall in \[Fictional Hell\]. He must
have engraved a magic circle into the roof.

So I had to get rid of his spell before it attacked the students.

I sprinted up three stairs at a time. Still, it didn’t consume much
stamina. This was where all my Hellish PT performances came into play.

As I ran up the stairs, I took out the Cloak of Disguise from my magic
pouch and put it on. I wore the ultramarine blue hooded cloak, put a
mask over my mouth, and pulled the hood over my head.

Magic Cloak of Disguise- Berserker. From now on, I would look like a
monster.

Fortunately, I arrived at the rooftop entrance door earlier than I had
expected.

“…!”

The entrance door was wide open. The first thing I saw was a large ashen
eyeball floating in the air.

\[Second Eye\]. It was a skill used by the Leafa the Illusive.

The eyeball was fixed on the rooftop below. It seemed like Leafa’s eye
was watching over the arena from inside the building with
\[Clairvoyance\].

Even when I went up on the roof, there was no response from it. I guess
it couldn’t see the hallway and the stairs leading up to the roof.
Otherwise, it would have seen me coming up. I was relieved.

Then, just beyond the eyeball, a strange, darkish membrane stretched
into the shape of a hemisphere came into view – It was a small
\[Fictional Hell\], covering part of the rooftop.

‘Why is that thing already activated?’

At that size, it must have been used against a small group of one or two
people. Someone came to hunt Leafa!

‘No way…?’

Professor Fernando had disappeared during the dueling evaluation, and he
hadn’t returned, even after I had finished my duel.

When he conducted an exam or performance evaluation inside a building,
he used telekinesis magic to set up nets. It was similar to a radar. If
an uninvited guest got caught in there, Professor Fernando would
immediately notice.

In any case… Professor Fernando had to be the person fighting Leafa in
that small \[Fictional Hell\].

“Crazy.”

There shouldn’t be any victims. There was also the problem of
intertwined affairs, and I hated the idea of an innocent victim, not to
mention the mess it would create.

In particular, Professor Fernando was a very important supporting
character in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ as he was there to keep Alice
Carroll in check.

He would play a big role in awakening Ian, who was going to fall into a
slump later on.

***I have to save him no matter what.***

‘It’s like a timed attack. I have to be as quick as possible.’

Leafa was toying around with Professor Fernando, and once the mana
contained in the magic circle was full, it would instantly increase the
size of \[Fictional Hell\].

***I’ll have to hunt him before that happens.***

Thinking so, I jumped into \[Fictional Hell\].

\* \* \*

The sea was like a mirror.

The shallow sea reflected the ultramarine blue sky. It was as if the sky
had been turned upside down.

The sky was densely packed with stars, with the Milky Way drifting by.

Every direction led to a horizon that stretched out as far as the eye
could see, there were nothing but abandoned buildings scattered about.
They were so shabby that they looked like they would crumble at the
slightest touch.

“Ugh!”

Fresh blood was splattered across that beautiful landscape.

*Kuung-!!*

Fernando’s body ricocheted through the air like a ball and slammed into
the building. Letting out a lone shriek, he was swept down to the
ground, the shallow sea soaked his lower body.

“Haah… Agh…”

He coughed blood out of his mouth. His blue eyes, however, glowed with a
fighting spirit.

When he looked up, he saw a swarm of monsters staring back at him. They
were alien beings with an appearance as though the Milky Way was flowing
through their jet-black skin.

They looked like they were one with the night sky, so Fernando named
them Night Sky Monsters.

The Night Sky Monsters took various forms. Ranging anywhere from the
forms of humans to animals, and magic beasts, and even an overwhelmingly
large octopus flying in space. The octopus was so unrealistically large
that it was impossible to gauge its size.

However, the thing that stood out the most was the near full moon. It
had to be far away, but it was so massive that it easily dwarfed the
moon he was used to seeing.

It was an incredibly beautiful sight to behold.

So much so, that he had the ridiculous thought that it might be a good
place for a grave.

“A grave.”

Fernando groaned as he got to his feet. His legs felt weak and wobbly,
but he managed to stand up by holding on to the wall of a building.

He remembered what he had told his associate professor.

He told them that if he didn’t return after 20 minutes had passed, they
were to immediately stop the dueling evaluation, evacuate the students,
gather their forces, and head for the rooftop.

Currently, the demon was having fun toying with him.

So, he had to stall for a little more time.

The odds were stacked against him. He was sure that he had killed quite
a few monsters, but the number had increased rather compared to before.
The monster seemed to be replicating themselves infinitely.

A meaningless war of attrition. It was a structure where you were bound
to lose.

It was at that time.

**\[Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe─────────\]**

On the full moon that was rising in the night sky, there was a mouth
growing. A mouth so large, that it took up half of the moon.

Its jaw was too even, and the teeth were too white.

Tens of thousands of eyes opened above it. It was no longer a moon, it
had already become a living being.

“…!”

Fernando’s eyes widened. The sight was so unsettling that it tingled his
senses. The overwhelming sight had rendered him speechless.

Tens of thousands of the full moon’s ominous eyes turned toward him in
unison.

It started laughing.

───────────────── \[Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\]———————————————

The grotesque laugh echoed throughout heaven and earth, as if it were
the sound of all things combined.

Even the Night Sky Monsters grew mouths large enough to fill half their
heads.

They also burst into laughter like the moon.

It was as if everything in this world was telling him to despair.

“Agh…!”

Before he knew it, a muscular Night Sky Monster had reached Fernando and
threw a fist the size of his entire body.

Fernando hurriedly deployed \[Basic Protection Magic\] to soften the
blow.

「Basic Protection Magic (Neutral Element, ★1)」

The monster’s fist struck Fernando’s temple.

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-!*

An explosive roar rang out, shaking his brain.

Fernando’s body flew lightly backwards, bouncing off the surface of the
sea like a skipping stone, and then rolled around in the shallow sea for
a while.

He made a thumping noise—and then he finally stopped moving.

All of his strength left his body.

“Ah…”

Fernando blankly looked up at the sky.

***It’s beautiful, it’s really beautiful. But let’s save the
appreciation for next time.***

With all his strength, he raised his upper body. He was still surrounded
by monsters, who were all aiming for his life.

His muscles refused to listen. He couldn’t stand up on his own two legs.

It was okay. He could still fight.

Fernando stretched out his right arm toward the monsters. In front of
each of his five fingers, compressed \[Elemental Magic Bullets\] were
created with telekinesis magic.

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1)」 + 「Ice Generation (Ice
Element, ★1)」 + 「Compression (Neutral Element, ★4)」

= 「Elemental Magic Bullet (Water + Ice Element)」

*BANG-!*

*BANG-!*

*BANG-!*

*BANG-!*

*BANG-!*

Fernando fired five shots of \[Elemental Magic Bullet\]. However, none
of the magic bullets hit their mark. His hands were trembling; he didn’t
even have the strength left to hit the enemy.

He didn’t have enough mana to use powerful magic like telekinesis magic
and to make matters worse, the number of monsters was increasing again.

Out in space, the giant octopus stared back at him.

The full moon was still giggling and mocking him.

The realization that he couldn’t win was agonizing. He would surely die
here.

Even so, he couldn’t back down now.

“I’m… a professor…”

To shake off this despair, he reminded himself of who he was.

His voice didn’t come out right, but he spoke with all his might.

“So for my students, I must…”

He became a professor, not for academic purposes, but out of a pure
desire to teach aspiring wizards.

For some reason, the memory of teaching magic to a young student who
dreamed of becoming a wizard came to mind.

He had only taught a small part of fire magic theory, but their eyes
sparkled as if he had taught them so well. He didn’t show it at the
time, but whenever he remembered it, a smile spread across his lips.

He used up his last remaining mana and fired five shots of \[Elemental
Magic Bullet\] once more. It was a precarious move that looked like the
elements would disperse at any moment due to lack of mana.

It might have simply been a meaningless struggle. Nonetheless, he needed
to stall for time, even if it was just a second more.

“Protect…”

Fernando’s small, firm voice was drowned out by the demon’s laughter.

\[What a funny face, Fernando—! It was fun, goodbye—\]

The eerie full moon bade him farewell with a patronizing voice.

The Night Sky Monsters began to mimic Fernando’s technique in unison.

「Darkness Generation (Darkness Element, ★1)」 + 「Fire Generation (Fire
Element, ★1)」 + 「Compression (Neutral Element, ★4)」

= 「Elemental Magic Bullet (Darkness + Fire Element)」

Their \[Elemental Magic Bullet\] appeared in the form of dark red
flames, materializing in front of each monster’s fingers, mouth, and
forehead.

Their sizes varied. There were monsters who made small-sized magic
bullets like Fernando, while some made large magic bullets to match
their size.

“…”

Numerous \[Elemental Magic Bullet\] spells were aimed at him from all
directions.

He was going to die this time.

*BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG——————————!*

The Night Sky Monsters started shooting their \[Elemental Magic Bullet\]
all at once, the sound of each shot blending with the next, filling the
air with the sound of a machine gun firing bullets.

Their \[Elemental Magic Bullet\] sliced through the air toward Fernando.

On the other hand, the \[Elemental Magic Bullet\] he fired was futile,
dispersing helplessly before even reaching the enemy.

Taking one last look at the Night Sky Monsters and the dark red flames
flying towards him, Fernando closed his eyes.

─It was then.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu───!!!!*

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa───!!!!*

“…!”

A majestic ice wall formed in front of Fernando and a tsunami of icy
cold flames poured down, engulfing the sea.

His eyes widened at the sight.

The \[Elemental Magic Bullet\] that were fired by the Night Sky Monsters
couldn’t even scratch the \[Ice Wall\] despite their elemental
advantage.

As soon as the solidly rising \[Ice Wall\] fulfilled its role, it
dispersed into powder while scattering blue light. A vast expanse of ice
began to appear in Fernando’s field of vision.

The bodies of many of the Night Sky Monsters were fatally frostbitten,
with purple blood oozing from their scorched or torn skin.

*Kuung─!*

A man descended from the sky and landed on a thick sheet of ice. A crack
was formed in the ice sheet.

The man was releasing cold air from every inch of his body.

With his arrival, the massive amount of ice that froze the sea became
blue powder and scattered.

In that glittering scene, the Night Sky Monsters collapsed helplessly.

Fernando caught a glimpse of the man’s back.

He had a rugged, muscular build with a broad back that stood out. He was
at least two meters tall.

He was wearing an ultramarine blue hooded cloak, with his hood draped
over his head.

\[Greuuuuuuung…\]

From the big man came a beastly cry, it wasn’t a sound that a human
would make. It was the sound of a beast warning its enemy.

Fernando found himself unable to speak. It was as if his brain had shut
down.

He knew who that monster was. It was unmistakably the suspicious being
that appeared during the class placement evaluation.

But why did the monster appear here?

Why did the monster protect him?

But before he could find the answer to those questions.

─────────────\[Gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\]

The monster ferociously roared at the full moon.

Meanwhile, beyond the Fictional Hell.

Dorothy Heartnova, a schoolgirl wearing a witch’s hat, skipped her class
in order to admire the blue sky and ocean horizon. The symmetry of the
landscape today was so appealing that she couldn’t help but look at it.

Dorothy floated comfortably in the sky while in a seated position as she
gently let the light of her colorful stars flow. This was possible
because starlight magic could manipulate natural forces, such as
gravity.

‘Is that…?’

Then, she looked down at the academy and noticed something strange.

On the roof of Duke Hall, a strange magic space had formed. It wasn’t
emitting any mana, so she hadn’t noticed it until now.

Rather, it was an unknown spell that was absorbing the mana floating in
the air. It was as if that magic had been cut off from the rest of the
world.

‘Another world?’

It appeared to be just in an initial demonstration phase, but was
rapidly expanding and would soon cover the entirety of Duke Hall.

Dorothy sensed that something suspicious had happened and flew toward
the spell.

Chapter 30: - ■■■■ (4) - Fictional Hell
=======================================

༺ **■■■■ (4) – Fictional Hell** ༻

I almost had a heart attack.

Of course, I knew there would be a full moon, but my heart still skipped
a beat at the realization.

I took a deep breath to calm myself down.

***I guess I’m weak against things like this…***

On top of that, the Berserker’s cry escaped my lips without me realizing
it. It didn’t match my voice at all; it was as if it felt my emotions
and spat them out like an AI.

Anyway, if I had been a second too late, it could have been an
irreversible situation.

Looking at Professor Fernando, he was on the verge of collapsing!

He looked like he would pass out at any moment, but he was doing his
best to hold on to his consciousness. Poor thing.

I should probably reassure him and let him pass out in peace.

\[…Who are you?\]

The moon’s voice echoed softly.

***That thing doesn’t look very pleasant. Look at that nice-looking set
of teeth. I really want to give it a light uppercut and knock ‘em
out.***

This was \[Fictional Hell\] and that repulsive looking full moon was
‘Leafa the Illusive’.

The creator of this world, and this was his domain.

“You can’t tell what I’m saying anyway.” (Grrrr─)

I was currently unable to communicate. I was a Berserker with zero
language skills.

In this state, it would be difficult to communicate with words, I would
instead communicate with my fists.

\[Ah, it’s you—\]

Only then did Leafa, in the form of the moon, seem to realize I was the
demon hunter.

“Huh?” (Greung?)

Before long, the Night Sky Monsters began to rise out of the sea.

Dozens, thousands, tens of thousands of monsters—countless monsters with
different shapes and sizes appeared.

*-Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!*

It was then that an earthquake occurred, and a massive arm stretched out
from the ground to beyond the horizon.

\[Wheeeeeeeeew────!!\]

A gigantic monster rose from the sea, it was a Giant wearing a skull
mask on its face, its whole body covered with the night sky where the
Milky Way flowed.

Seeing it from this far away, it appeared to be of a size that went
beyond imagination. Even then, it was much smaller than the octopus in
the sky.

\[The troublemaker. You’re the one who’s been a nuisance to us demons,
aren’t you?\]

***Of course.***

***You will also be dealt with soon enough.***

The \[Fictional Hell\] would soon grow in size and engulf Duke Hall. I
had to defeat him before that to prevent any victims other than
Professor Fernando.

\[Ah, I wanted to meet you! I’ve been wondering what that crazy guy was
like! Heh heh heh! I’m so happy right now!\]

“Is that so?” (Grrr—)

\[Troublemaker, troublemaker—! Let me play with you—!\]

The full moon cried out, laughing like a child, as the monsters began to
pounce on me, their huge mouths grotesquely laughing.

\[Kyahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha————!\]

\[Fictional Creature\] **Lv:** 80

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to bite you.\]

If I get killed by these monsters, I would lose my mind and become a
vegetable.

The strength of each individual couldn’t be ignored and with an infinite
number of them spawning, no matter how hard I fought, it would only be a
long-term battle that I was bound to lose.

I didn’t know if they even gave a lot of experience points because in
the game they wouldn’t give any at all to prevent abuse from easy power
leveling.

It was a part of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 6, Chapter 3,
Fictional Hell, the Subjugation of Leafa the Illusive.

The player must protect the students by defeating the fictional
creatures. That was because Leafa held a *defense game* against Ian and
his colleagues while imprisoning the students.

If even one student died, it was game over, so I remembered swearing a
lot and retrying.

After surviving for a certain amount of time, a story cutscene would
appear. This was the scene where Ian Fairytale learned how to attack
this world.

The main character, Ian Fairytale, struggled with his supporters, but
somehow endured with the determination to protect the students…

As he swung his sword, he repeated to himself, *‘I can do it’.*

Eventually, he started self-hypnosis while saying *‘I am strong’* or *‘I
can be stronger’.*

And then he became surprised by how strong he really was. That was how
the full-scale subjugation against Leafa began in earnest.

‘Yes, the \[Fictional Hell\] strategy is…’

‘Self-hypnosis’.

***I have to be like a delusional person.***

It was to confront the world of illusion with delusion. If I hadn’t
learned this strategy, even a level 180 Dorothy Heartnova would have no
choice but to struggle.

However, if one learned how to play around it, even a normal level 51
Isaac, could defeat him with \[Hunter\] inactive.

The key was that I had to visualize myself getting stronger. The more I
know what would happen if I became stronger, the more effective it would
be.

If I couldn’t visualize myself becoming stronger, there was no point in
learning this strategy.

As a veteran of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had a clear understanding
of what it was like to master the ice element.

In other words, I was Leafa’s natural enemy.

“…”

Everything in this world was against me.

Firstly, I put an \[Ice Barrier\] around Professor Fernando.

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★6)」

***Let’s visualize.***

‘Myself becoming a Munchkin^1^Korean word for Over Powered.’

For just a moment, I shut out the world; a skill I had acquired while
studying when confined to my desk during my exam life, disconnecting
myself from the world.

I colored myself, and my own life, into nothingness.

The world became silent as I redefined myself in it.

I am strong.

I am strong.

I am the strongest in the world.

Strong.

Every cell in my body felt unfamiliar. I gently lowered my head and took
a brief moment to get used to this unfamiliar sensation.

My skin was more saturated, and my body seemed brighter. The hair on the
inside of my hood felt like it stood on its ends, and my nerves were
alert.

Light blue cold air flowed gently from my whole body, and I felt as if I
was capable of using the most powerful magic in the world.

My body, everything in me, felt so dense and heavy, but at the same
time, I became light.

Passive skill, \[Ice Sovereign\].

Its effects were simple and clear.

It maximized the output of the ice magic I was about to use.

“Hah.”

My eyes took in the world rushing toward me.

A light blue chill escaped from my breath.

***It’s time for you to sleep.***

***Since from now on, I’m a Super Saiyan.***

\* \* \*

Dorothy entered \[Fictional Hell\].

It was easy to enter that magical space. It was as if she were crossing
another dimension. She was swimming in the black hole-like darkness, and
a beautiful landscape opened up in her field of vision.

An open sea that mirrored the night sky and abandoned buildings dotted
the landscape.

The night sky was filled with stars and The Milky Way, a giant octopus
watching her from beyond the universe, rings of planets streaking across
the sky, and a full moon with a mouth large enough to cover half of its
body.

And.

An army of monsters rushing at Professor Fernando and a hulking figure
in an ultramarine blue hooded coat.

Dorothy watched the spectacle from the sky, frozen in place.

◆◆◆◆◆────

With the activation of her unique trait \[All in the World\], Dorothy
confirmed the unknown existence hidden in the giant’s essence; a
near-infinite mass of mana. An overwhelming power that could swallow
everything in this world.

She would never forget where she had seen it.

“Isaac?”

It was Isaac, a silver-blue haired first-year student.

But it was definitely not him; the hulking man was a hooded, muscular
monster.

‘…A magic disguise?’

Dorothy got the answer. Other than a Magic Cloak of Disguise, nothing
could explain Isaac’s drastic change in appearance.

But why?

The being in Isaac’s essence was staring elsewhere, its countless eyes
all bright red. As if Dorothy didn’t matter.

The place all those eyes were focused was the full moon. Dorothy
realized that the true identity of the full moon was a demon, with the
power of \[All in the World\].

Only then did she know.

The unknown being in Isaac’s essence was hostile to the demons.

\[ ■■ ■■■ ■ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■. \]

***It was a very harsh life.***

The being in Isaac’s essence began to chant.

As soon as the introduction rang out, a chill ran down Dorothy’s spine.

“This is dangerous…”

Dorothy channeled her mana to its maximum output, covering herself with
a powerful shield of starlight.

Isaac intended to use powerful magic that could destroy this world. He
was so focused on casting the spell that he didn’t even sense Dorothy’s
mana.

In other words, Dorothy would have to defend herself against Isaac’s
magic.

Fernando didn’t have to defend, since Isaac had already prepared the
safest means of protection, the \[Ice Barrier\].

\[ ■■■ ■ ■■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Not a single thing remained by my side.***

\[ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Nothing had meaning in my life.***

In ancient times, there was someone said to have fully mastered the ice
element.

A woman whose name had been lost to time, and was now referred to by
‘Ice Sovereign’ or ‘Witch with a Scythe’, had created magic with her own
life.

The miserable words of an Archwizard who found no meaning in continuing
to exist in this world.

A chant filled with grief and resentment.

At the end of her life, a calamity plunged the world into a hundred year
ice age.

Soon, behind the Berserker-shaped Isaac, a series of light blue magic
circles began to materialize in quick succession, like cogs in a wheel.

\[ ■■■■■■■■■■. \]

***Loneliness.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Only you were by my side.***

\[ ■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■. \]

***I did not revel in the glory of endless victories alone.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■. \]

***Fame and fortune had no meaning.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■ ■■■■■■■. \]

***Only when the owl of dusk spread its wings did I realize.***

The giant octopus floating in space sensed the danger and began to
strike down with its feet.

The air vibrated. The giant octopus, which could easily subdue an army
of monsters with a single arm, fell with a violent crash.

The scenery of the beautiful night sky disappeared, and the surroundings
were colored with shadows—

\[ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■. \]

***This world with only you.***

In the darkness, clusters of magic circles carved out the thin air at
irregular intervals, even as the octopus’ arms descended upon the world.

Behind all those magic circles, a huge magic circle drew a trajectory
that seemed to touch the sky.

It glowed brilliantly.

Isaac stretched his right arm upward.

Massive amounts of ice mana coalesced like a whirlpool and became a cold
sun that cast a pale blue light.

The cold sun grew larger and larger in an instant, even surpassing the
sky itself.

\[ ■■ ■■■■ ■■■■. \]

***Is like hell.***

When the unknown monster’s essence finished those words, Isaac lowered
his arm.

The cold sun began to fall on the hordes of monsters that began to look
like ants.

And it was only for a moment.

「Cocytus (Ice Element, ★9)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaahhh━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!!!*

*Chaaaaaaaaaaaaaah━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!!!*

The cold sun’s rays pierced through the clouds.

It drove away the darkness and brought blue light to the sky.

In the blink of an eye, the sea froze over, and an icy cold wave raged
violently, ravaging the world.

A rampaging freeze of death.

Cold winds and heavy snow.

Numerous ice spikes rose from the ground, penetrating the already-frozen
monsters.

A beam of light spread out in all directions, engulfing everything in
its path.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Snap.

The night sky turned white and this world became a frozen hell, as its
name suggested.

Cold gusts of wind and frozen ice prevailed, transforming the land into
a hellhole of extreme cold that would kill anyone who entered.

The army of monsters and abandoned buildings were obliterated by the
beam of light.

Outside the sky, the giant octopus was frozen solid and time seemed to
stand still.

Dorothy and Fernando were speechless.

“I just… What did I just see…?”

It was far beyond their imagination.

Dorothy’s starlight shield was a wreck. Despite the distance between
herself and Isaac, despite the fact that it was a shield made by using
the maximum output of her mana, and despite the fact that she controlled
and blocked the surrounding natural forces…

It was not difficult to imagine the scene where she would have been
annihilated if she ran at Isaac like a certain army of monsters and was
hit by \[Cocytus\].

“Huh…”

Fernando burst into laughter as if it were absurd.

The overwhelming strength of the man standing in front of him evoked a
sense of emptiness rather than admiration.

For whatever reason, it was a relief to know that a monster among
monsters was on his side.

He could no longer hold onto his consciousness. In relief, Fernando laid
down and collapsed.

\[Uh, how…?\]

Compared to others, Leafa was less affected by \[Cocytus\]. He must have
been watching over this world from farther away than anyone else. Even
so, his full moon body was frozen in various places. Because of its
gigantic form, its condition was reflected even in the eyes of Isaac and
Dorothy.

Then, Isaac bent his knees and kicked off the ice…

*Kuuung─!*

…And started running toward the full moon.

*Kuuung─!*

*Kuuung─!*

*Kuuung─!*

Isaac ran across the ice, his body soaring through the sky with every
step.

To Leafa, it was the sound of approaching death.

Isaac took one step after another, and then he propelled himself like a
rocket toward the full moon.

*Kwaaaang—!*

\[Oh, no…! G-get away…! Do not come—!\]

A deep sense of dread washed over Leafa. His survival instincts were
screaming at him.

***He’s dangerous. He’s dangerous. He can’t be defeated. The possibility
of winning doesn’t even exist.***

***How can such a being exist in this academy? How can there be such an
abnormal monster!?***

The only one who could deal with someone like this was the Evil God
Nephid.

Isaac conjured \[Frostfire\] from both hands behind his body, and
propelled himself across \[Cocytus\]. The \[Frostfire\] vastly increased
his momentum as he traveled across the frozen sea.

The speed was incredible. He couldn’t follow Isaac’s movement with his
eyes.

\[Do not come———!!\]

As soon as the distance closed a little, Isaac’s magic would be able to
reach Leafa.

Leafa screamed in terror and released \[Fictional Hell\]. He wanted to
escape as quickly as possible.

*Clink—*————

*Chararararara*—————

The world shattered into pieces like a broken pane of glass.

In an instant, light engulfed everything, \[Fictional Hell\] was
released, and bizarre purple mana dispersed into the air.

All those who were inside returned to the outside world.

The familiar and ordinary scenery of Duke Hall’s rooftop was reflected
in their eyes.

*Rooooooarrrrr*─*!*

As soon as \[Fictional Hell\] was released, a wall of black flame rose
up and split the center of the rooftop.

「Flame Wall (Fire Element, ★4)」 +「Black Flame (Fire Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Flame Wall (Fire Element)」

\[Ah… AHH!\]

In the meantime, Leafa tried to quickly run away.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Drrrrrrrr*─*!*

Walls of ice rose from all sides, creating a ceiling and blocking any
means of escape.

And then.

*Snap*─

“Gotcha.”

Isaac’s hand cut through the flames and grabbed Leafa’s head.

Before he knew it, his mask was off and his hood was down, and Isaac had
regained his original appearance and voice.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

The ice lightly created by Isaac ignored its elemental disadvantage and
extinguished the flames.

Die. Die.

Leafa trembled and examined the overwhelming monster with his \[Second
Eye\].

\[…Huh?\]

For a moment, Leafa doubted his own eyes.

Wavy silver hair with a bluish tint, and cold red eyes.

The weakest of Märchen Academy’s freshmen in the Magic Department, with
a Grade E in mana.

He was a candidate who could not even be considered a hindrance, more
than anyone else. Because of that, he didn’t even watch his duel.

\[Grade E…? How could you…?\]

His mind started to jumble with confusion. Leafa couldn’t understand
this situation at all.

\[…!\]

Isaac, without answering, began condensing ice mana into his other hand
and a magic circle of \[Frost Explosion\] materialized in front of him.

Leafa was startled.

\[S-save me…! Spare me, please…!\]

A pitiful voice.

However, Leafa’s desperate cry only echoed helplessly in the small space
made by \[Ice Wall\].

Chapter 31: - Duel (5)
======================

༺ **Duel (5)**༻

There was some information I wanted to extract from Leafa the Illusive.

So I unmasked myself. I wouldn’t be able to talk to him while disguised
as the Berserker.

As soon as \[Fictional Hell\] began to unravel, I quickly began to lock
\[Ice Sovereign\] deep inside my body.

Even with the \[Hunter\] trait activated, I was weaker than I was in
\[Fictional Hell\], so there was no telling what kind of strain \[Ice
Sovereign\] would put on my body if I kept it activated for even a
moment.

As a result, my skin had regained its original color.

“Don’t do anything stupid.”

\[O-of course…!\]

“From now on, answer what I ask you.”

I said in a cynical tone as I narrowed my eyes.

Leafa was terrified. Like a common idiom, he was shaking like a leaf.
The tremors were transmitted through my hands as I held his head.

\[Yes, yes! I’ll answer anything! I will answer, so please…\]

“How much does Alice Carroll know about me?”

If Alice found out about me at this point in the story, it would be game
over. Thus, the amount of information she had about me was of great
importance to me.

I was the weakest extra with the worst potential in all of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱. In other words, in order to defeat the Evil God Nephid, I
had to focus on becoming stronger as quickly as possible.

That was why I prioritized raising \[Physical Training Efficiency\] and
\[Magical Training Efficiency\] first, but later on, when they’ve
reached their maximum potential, it’d be better to increase \[vs. Human
Combat Power\] as well, to help me stand a chance against dark forces
like Alice.

So, until I reached the level where I could stand up to Alice, I needed
to hide my identity as much as possible.

The reason why I put up an \[Ice Wall\] before capturing Leafa was to
prevent someone from witnessing this.

***It’s time for me to take care of things.***

\[Child, how do you know Alice…?\]

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kaaaahhhhh─!*

\[Kaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh─!\]

I triggered a short burst of a \[Frost Explosion\] and froze his right
arm. If he tried to remove the ice, his right arm would be hacked off.

“Just answer me.”

\[Ugh, ah, I don’t know anything… I don’t know… Child, Alice is still
trying to find you…\]

Leafa gritted his teeth and cried while enduring the pain.

He responded politely. He and Alice had a relationship where it wouldn’t
be surprising if one of them betrayed the other at any time, and he was
a light-talker in the first place.

‘I expected this for now.’

The student evaluation data of Märchen Academy was kept under strict
security. The two who played the biggest role in this were the
Headmistress Elena, and the magic of Aria, the Tower Master of the Hegal
Magic Tower, which was in a contractual relationship with the Academy.

As long as they were there, I didn’t have to worry about my information
being leaked.

“Then next. What is Alice’s plan? Tell me how she intends to find me.”

Since it was me, not Ian Fairytale, who was hunting the demons, it was
difficult to predict what Alice would do in the future.

She wasn’t the type to act thoughtlessly, except for when she was around
cute things, so she is definitely up to something.

Just looking at how the final boss of Act 6, Chapter 3 of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱ had already appeared, I could guess.

‘The story is going to get really twisted.’

\[I don’t know, that kind of thing!\]

“……..”

I shot another short burst of \[Frost Explosion\] at Leafa’s leg.

*Kwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh-!!!*

\[Kaaaaaahhhh-!!!\]

Leafa screamed at the top of his lungs. However, he didn’t show the
slightest sign of defiance.

\[Leafa the Illusive\] **Psychology:** \[Dreadfully frightened of you.\]

Yes, he was afraid.

It must be because my hand was holding Leafa’s head at the moment. If I
conjure magic with this hand at any time, it would crack open his skull
and he would die instantly.

\[Ugh, really, really, I don’t know…, I don’t know… Kuh…\]

He really didn’t seem to know.

I wasn’t surprised that there was little information to dig up.

Alice wasn’t the type of person to go around talking about her own
plans, much less to a person she didn’t have a close relationship with.

The only thing I could call a harvest this time was that Alice still
hasn’t figured out my true identity yet.

\[I, s-since I answered your question… ar-are you sparing my life…?\]

“…?”

***What are you talking about?***

“When did I say I was going to let you live?”

\[···Huh?\]

It seemed that he was seriously mistaken. I never said that I would let
him live if he answered all my questions.

“You were going to toy with me, the students, the professors, and kill
them all, right?”

Human life was like a toy to him.

Now and in the future, he would live with that murderous intent.

“Why would I let a guy like that live?”

\[Ahhhhhhh!\]

Before Leafa could beg for his life, I shot another short burst of
\[Frost Explosion\] at the back of the his head.

*Kwaaaang———!*

There was a small explosion of light blue cold air, and in the blink of
an eye, I saw Leafa’s mangled upper body trapped in a block of ice.

After dispelling the ice mana that had turned into a block of ice, Leafa
fell to the ground; his whole body turned into gray powder and piled up
on the floor like cigarette ash.

“Whew.”

Only then did I relax my expression.

‘Successfully took care of the problem.’

That was really fortunate.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Leafa the Illusive (Lv
130)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 56!\]
\[You’ve gained 10 stat points!\] \[You have unlocked the achievement
❰An Illusion Within An Illusion❱! You have gained an additional 10 bonus
stat points!\]

It was 「Act 3, Chapter 1, Duel」 where I thought I’d just measure my
combat ability and move on.

But I somehow ended up getting 20 stat points.

However, more importantly.

“I already got this…”

An ashen bracelet laid on the ground where Leafa the Illusive had
disappeared. I picked it up.

\[You have obtained the loot \[Elemental Bracelet\]!\] \[Elemental
Bracelet\] Increases the \[Elemental Resistance\] of certain elements by
\[40\], excluding the light and darkness elements.

Rank: Tier 1

Effect Duration: 24 hours

Cooldown Time: 24 hours

‘Elemental Bracelet’. Naturally, I thought I’d get this in the second
semester.

…For now, I had to think about my stat points and the Elemental Bracelet
later. There were other things I had to take care of first.

My body suddenly grew heavy. The \[Hunter\] trait had been deactivated.
Before that, I sensed mana around me, but there wasn’t much. Still,
there was nothing wrong with being safe.

Afterwards, I put on the mask and the hood on my head and transformed
into the Berserker.

I dispelled the \[Ice Barrier\] placed on Professor Fernando and the
\[Ice Wall\] that imprisoned me.

As soon as the \[Ice Wall\] dispersed into bluish powder, I turned my
head toward Professor Fernando.

If I took his unconscious body out now, the situation would be over.

Although, I was sure Professor Fernando must have instructed his
associate professor to come up to the roof after a certain amount of
time had passed.

However, I couldn’t just leave a dying man on the roof without
confirmation.

I must turn the fainted Professor Fernando over to the administration
without revealing my presence.

A professor was injured. If it was discovered that I was with Professor
Fernando, I would be summoned by the Truth Investigation Committee for
questioning.

The Student Council President was also included in the emergency contact
list of the Truth Investigation Committee, so it was better to avoid
that situation as much as possible.

“You worked hard, Professor.”

There was an easy way out.

I headed for the rooftop entrance with Professor Fernando on my back.

\* \* \*

Luce Eltania was walking down the hallway of Duke Hall.

The duel had been her triumph. At first, she was going to go easy on Ian
Fairytale for his courage in challenging her to a duel, but then she
simply finished him off with a 5-star water magic.

This was because Isaac bothered her too much.

He had nosebleeds every day and worked hard, but eventually, he met a
dead-end and declared his surrender.

‘How upset would he be?’

With a face of resigned acceptance, Isaac patted Tristan on the
shoulder, acknowledged him, and left.

The fact that he was trying so hard to look nonchalant, as if he was
relieved, made her feel even more sorry for him.

She hadn’t decided what to say to him, but she wanted to meet him.

She quickly ended her duel and swiftly stepped out into the hallway so
as not to be stopped by the guard wizards.

Ever since she was 10 years old, she had not been interested in others,
so she was not good at consolation or encouragement.

Even so, if she could pretend to run into Isaac by chance, and then say
something along the lines of *‘Cheer up’*… she felt like he would feel
at ease.

‘Where are you…?’

But Isaac was nowhere to be seen. Had he already left Duke Hall? No, he
wasn’t allowed to leave Duke Hall while the dueling evaluation was in
progress, which meant he was still somewhere in the building.

***I wonder where he is.***

Luce headed for the stairs. Since Isaac wasn’t on this floor, he was
probably on the upper floor or on the roof.

“Student Luce? What are you doing here?”

Luce ran into an associate professor who was coming toward the stairs
from the opposite direction. He was accompanied by examiners and five
healers.

Seeing them appear in a group, Luce was puzzled.

“The dueling evaluation has been suspended. Please return to your seats
and comply with academic regulations.”

“Huh…?”

The associate professor spoke in a polite yet urgent voice.

She couldn’t understand what was going on, but it was clear that
something unexpectedly bad had happened.

They passed Luce and began to climb the stairs.

Isaac was probably up there as well.

Luce contemplated whether to follow them up or not.

“Student Dorothy?”

Just then, a female student came down from the top of the stairs.

She stopped the associate professor’s party in the middle of the
stairwell.

“…?”

Luce’s eyes widened in surprise when she saw the pretty schoolgirl with
long light purple hair wearing a witch’s hat.

Her cosmic, star-shaped pupils seemed otherworldly.

This was the same senior who had recently been spending time at Isaac’s
training grounds every day.

“Wait for a moment.”

Dorothy said, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips as she
looked at Luce and the associate professor’s party standing below.

“Wait?”

“Yes, please wait a moment\~.”

Why all of a sudden?

Luce and the associate professor’s party couldn’t understand.

“Because it’s dangerous now.”

“…?”

“Then···.”

Closing her eyes, Dorothy snapped her fingers and began to drum a
rhythm.

The associate professor’s party watched her eccentricity from afar.

Dorothy Heartnova was a force to be reckoned with at Märchen Academy, a
genius whose talents seemed to have come from the very heavens
themselves, and the pride of the academy.

That was why, when she used the word ‘dangerous,’ it was unavoidable
that the associate professor and his party felt uneasy.

Still, as a professor, he couldn’t be influenced by the words of a
student.

“Student Dorothy,” said Philip Meltron, the professor in charge of the
Magic Department’s freshmen Class A, as he stepped forward.

“It’s over now\~”

“…?”

Dorothy opened her eyes and moved out of their way. Her eccentricity was
over in just five seconds.

The associate professor and his party did not understand why, but they
started climbing the stairs again.

After climbing to the second floor.

“Professor Fernando?!”

A man collapsed in the hallway had caught their eyes.

It was Professor Fernando, covered in wounds and unconscious.

His body bore the traces of a fierce battle.

Beside him, Dorothy’s familiar was casting a healing spell on Fernando.
A white cat with a pink ribbon on its tail was rubbing its own cheek
against Fernando’s.

“He needs healing magic! Please move Professor Fernando quickly!”

Getting Fernando to a hospital room took precedence over assessing the
situation.

The associate professor gave urgent instructions to the healers.

Meanwhile.

Dorothy stood leaning against the corner, listening to the bustle of the
associate professor’s party. Soon after, the healing squad passed her on
their way down the stairs, carrying Fernando on a stretcher.

The rest of the group seemed to be heading for the roof.

Only then did Dorothy begin to descend the stairs.

‘You’re inexperienced, President. You should thank this older sister for
buying you time to escape.’

Dorothy shrugged her shoulders triumphantly.

Isaac.

There must be a reason why such a strong being was hiding his identity.
Whatever that reason was, Dorothy decided to keep his secret.

The fact that he had fought to protect the people of the Academy was
enough to convince her.

It was natural for her to be considerate, thought Dorothy.

“Huh? You?”

As Dorothy descended the stairs, she met the eyes of a schoolgirl who
had been watching her.

Her rose gold hair was delicate, and her detailed features were very
elegant. The morpho butterfly-colored hair straps on either side of her
head looked exquisite.

Dorothy knew who she was. She was Luce Eltania, the undisputed head
among the first-year students of the Magic Department.

She’d often spotted her watching Isaac before he went to training. She
was a cute Junior, perhaps she had a crush on him.

Dorothy tilted her head with a bright smile on her face.

“Do you have something to do with me?”

“I was just wondering why Senior was here, since Duke Hall should be
off-limits right now.”

“Yeah, that’s right. However, rules are meaningless to me.”

Luce frowned at her.

What the hell?

“Did something happen upstairs?”

“None of your business, cute Junior\~.”

After replying in a playful voice, Dorothy walked past Luce.

Luce’s gaze followed her wordlessly.

“Ah.”

Suddenly, Dorothy realized something and stopped in her tracks to look
back at Luce.

“Your crush, it’s going to be a little difficult.”

“…?”

***What do you mean?*** Luce asked with a question mark hovering over
her head.

Dorothy smirked in amusement and walked away with light steps.

<span id="0031_32_-_Duel_-_Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 32: - Duel - Interlude
==============================

**༺ Duel – Interlude ༻**

Fortunately, the plan was successful and turned out smoothly.

With Professor Fernando on my back, I stepped through the exit of the
rooftop, and after I was sure no one was nearby, I carefully placed him
on the ground.

I then took off the Cloak of Disguise and placed it in my magic pouch,
and carried him back down the stairs.

When I was certain we were close enough to the arena, I gently placed
him in the hallway.

I took out ‘firecrackers’ from my magic pouch. Since I had to go around
hiding my identity, I made sure to stock up on tools that would distract
others.

Then, using a \[Fire Generation\] scroll, I lit the fuse and placed the
firecrackers nearby. If the firecrackers exploded, the proctor or
security guard who heard the sound would immediately notice and rush
here.

After everything was set up, I ran down the hallway and headed for the
window. Could it be because of the hellish PT performance? I jumped out
the window like a stuntman and quickly ran away. If I couldn’t hear the
sound of the firecrackers anymore, then nothing more needs to be said.

I sprinted all the way to the first floor training room.

Since the aisles were wide open, I was able to enter naturally and blend
in with the students.

A few moments later, I realized my plan had worked when I heard that
Professor Fernando had been sent away.

I also heard that dueling evaluation was suspended, and it was easy to
guess the reason.

Professor Fernando probably said something like this to his associate
professor, *‘If I do not come back for a certain period of time, stop
the dueling evaluation and go up to the roof with the combat troops’.*
It was a guess I had made earlier, but I guess I was right. It would
have been fine if I had just left him on the roof.

Still, I didn’t have a choice. Unless there was concrete evidence,
speculation was just speculation.

***Anyway, let’s consider the result. Things worked out the way I
thought they would, right?***

‘Well, a good thing is a good thing.’

I didn’t feel the need to overthink it.

Suddenly, an announcement was made that the dueling evaluation would
resume after the truth of this incident was clearly revealed.

A few days later…

The findings of the Truth Investigation Committee’s investigation were
posted on the bulletin board in Orphin Hall, a dormitory building for
the Magic Department.

The Truth Investigation Committee investigated the statements of those
involved in the case, the traces of mana, and more. They were able to
conclude that a demon appeared and was eliminated.

The person who played an active part was the suspicious individual who
had appeared during the class placement evaluation. That would be me in
the form of a black monster.

The details of the investigation were kept secret, so it was unclear who
was involved in the case or what happened.

In any case, it was fortunate that there was nothing about ‘Isaac.’

‘Now the atmosphere is getting worse.’

The atmosphere of the academy had sunk to an all-time low. Demons, who
were considered once-in-a-lifetime natural disasters, had appeared
several times in such a short period of time.

The students had repeated discussions about why demons appeared so
often. Some suggested that *‘It was just bad luck’* while others
believed that *‘It’s because people with high mana gathered together,
which attracted the demons.’*

By the way, once again, the academy authorities were planning to make a
concerted effort to settle the issue regarding the frequent appearance
of demons.

However, after the Thunderbird Subjugation, the situation would spiral
out of control, and eventually, even the Imperial Knights would be
called in to investigate the case.

My condolences to the faculty and the academy authorities, who would be
facing an even harder time in the future.

‘Ah, that’s right, something like that happened.’

I suddenly remembered what Kaya had said to me when she came to me with
a shocked expression.

“Sir Isaac! The black monster appeared during the class placement
evaluation and now again…!”

“Huh?”

“Could it be that it’s a demon who betrayed the other demons?!”

Of course, she was an idiot, so I just let it go.

Hunter

In the middle of the quiet night, I once again came to the corner of the
butterfly garden to train.

I checked my status window. The ultimate buff skill of the ice element,
the 9-star passive skill \[Ice Sovereign\], was still on my list of
skills.

Regardless of the \[Hunter\] effect, I had acquired it after fulfilling
the acquisition conditions.

‘Awesome.’

It was a great outcome.

The day I defeated Leafa the Illusive, I noticed that \[Ice Sovereign\]
still remained in the status window, so I started shadowboxing while
kicking up a fuss.

If I could handle \[Ice Sovereign\] properly, my power would increase by
leaps and bounds.

‘I already have the Elemental Bracelet.’

The Elemental Bracelet was a magic tool that, when worn on the wrist,
would greatly increase one’s resistance to any single element except for
the light and darkness elements.

I tried it with a 2-star magic scroll right away, but the scroll wasn’t
very effective, which made it difficult to accurately test.

After the dueling evaluation, it was time for 「Act 3, Chapter 2,
Familiar」of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ to begin. At that time, when I
have my own familiar, I’ll have to ask them to cast spells on me, so I
could test it properly.

Using the newly acquired stat points, I invested 10 in \[Physical
Training Efficiency\] and 10 in \[Learning Efficiency\], and with that,
they increased to B+ and C+ grades respectively.

Now, the rate at which my stamina and strength will develop would be
faster than most of the Knight Department students who regularly worked
out.

“Whew.”

I took a deep breath and calmed my emotions.

It was time to retest the \[Ice Sovereign\] skill that I had recently
tried out.

***I’m nervous…***

I almost high-fived Great King Yeomra^1^Yeomra (also known as
Yeomra-Daewang) was the Korean god of the dead. He was the fifth of the
ten Kings of the Underworld (called Shi-wang) and was believed to be the
supreme ruler of the Underworld. the other day when I unleashed the
power of \[Ice Sovereign\].

Still, it was critical to continue testing it and to eventually make it
my own, especially since \[Ice Sovereign\] was the ultimate buff skill
of the ice element.

‘Focus.’

I touched something cold that was nestled deep inside my body. It was
the trigger to draw out the power of \[Ice Sovereign\] that laid dormant
inside of me.

As a rule of thumb, I raised the power of \[Ice Sovereign\], which had
been reduced to 0%, to a rough estimate of about 1%.

At the same time.

“Ugh!!”

An excruciating pain shot through my entire body, it was as if every
cell in my body was being stabbed by a needle.

“Agh… ugh…”

I immediately suppressed the power of \[Ice Sovereign\] to 0%. The pain
subsided as if nothing had happened, but before I knew it, I had
collapsed on the lawn, groaning. I must have blacked out for a moment.

‘Ugh, I think I’m going to get PTSD….’

***It hurts so much…***

I still had a long way to go. Right now, I couldn’t properly handle
\[Ice Sovereign\] with my normal body.

Perhaps, it would be better to try it again properly after I trigger
\[Hunter\].

After I composed myself, I got up and started training other spells as
usual.

In the meantime, while I was doing so.

“What are you practicing?”

“…!”

I was startled when someone poked me in the back.

I quickly turned around and saw a schoolgirl wearing a witch hat,
covering her mouth and suppressing her laughter.

Soon after, she started giggling.

“Nihihihi…! Oh, what was that reaction? The President is cute.”

———————❖———————

I was feeling a little nauseous, but I gritted my teeth and endured it
after seeing her face.

“What are you doing this late at night?”

“The stars are so beautiful tonight, I was watching them and suddenly
thought of you, so I came to see you! You’re still training, huh!”

The sky was embroidered with beautiful stars. The stars appeared in
great abundance due to the cloudless sky.

“I had a feeling. Our President is diligent\~”

Dorothy mischievously opened her half-closed eyes and smiled slyly.

I felt uncomfortable for some reason.

There was no clear basis for it, but my experience of playing ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱ told me that this person didn’t come here because she
suddenly remembered me.

“…Senior, do you have something to say to me?”

So, I probed her at once.

I couldn’t read Dorothy’s mind because it was protected by starlight
mana, so I had no choice but to find out this way.

Dorothy was still smiling. But the silence that followed was no
different from affirming my words.

Only then did I know the true nature of the sense of my discomfort.
Dorothy’s always natural, pretentious smile was showing a falseness that
shouldn’t be there. It meant that her mind was a little disorganized.

“What makes you think that?”

***Don’t underestimate me because you’re my favourite.***

“It just seems that way.”

Dorothy thought about it for a moment.

Then, with a wry expression, she looked me straight in the eyes.

“You’re sharp, President. It’s only been two weeks since we’ve known
each other, yet you know me very well. It’s like we’ve known each other
for a long time.”

It was because I saw you a lot in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱

Of course, I couldn’t really answer that, so I remained silent.

I wasn’t sure how my emotions were coming across right now, but Dorothy
looked doubtful.

“Can I ask you something?”

“Ask me anything.”

“Will you answer?”

“I’ll answer whatever it is.”

“Nihihi, okay.”

*Swish.*

Dorothy suddenly leaned toward me and stuck her head out.

I had already gotten used to her act of leaning her face close to mine.

I stared at her in silence, not pulling my head back.

Soon after, she asked.

“Why is the President working so hard?”

“…?”

***What is she talking about?***

“Is there some reason you have to train yourself to death?”

***…I’m definitely nearing death with all this training.***

So, to a person who was gifted with exceptional magic talent such as
Dorothy, someone like me might be a rare breed.

***My goal is to defeat the Evil God Nephid and knowing just how
powerful Nephid was in Hell difficulty, I simply can’t afford to neglect
my training.***

I couldn’t rely on the Master Fainter, Ian Fairytale.

Of course, I could confide in a Munchkin like Dorothy Heartnova that the
Evil God Nephid would resurrect in the distant future. It would seem
reasonable on the surface.

But.

‘I can’t.’

Dorothy was cursed to die within the next year.

In addition, the curse is accelerated when she comes into contact with a
being whose ‘origin’ comes from demons. For example, the ‘Fictional
Creatures’ that I fought a few days ago, a miscellaneous mob created by
a demon.

It was one thing to fight with someone like ‘Thunderbird Galia’ who
became a demon on the day of the end-of-semester evaluation.

However, if she got into a fight with ‘Vera the Summoner’, a demon by
birth, she would surely lose her life in no time.

Other natural demons were no exception either.

‘If I told you, you’d undoubtedly sacrifice your life to protect the
academy. That is not what I want.’

She would treat her life as expendable, since she was going to die
anyways.

“There is no reason.”

I lied on purpose.

Dorothy should have known right away that I was lying.

“It’s just that it’s good to be strong.”

“Hmm.”

Dorothy looked at me with a disapproving expression.

But she didn’t bother to dig into my answer and just laughed.

“You’re no fun, President.”

A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, but she looked disappointed.
It didn’t matter.

***I don’t want to put you in danger.***

***I’m going to save you, my favourite, anyways. After that, you’ll just
have to help me.***

Soon Dorothy turned her back and began to walk away.

“Senior, are you leaving?”

Dorothy just waved her hand without answering.

Then, as she disappeared among the trees, I began to hear the sound of
grasshoppers.

‘Ah, it feels strange.’

It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I didn’t do anything wrong, but I
felt a faint sense of guilt, like the kind you feel when you say or do
something wrong.

***…Let’s just focus on training.***

I slapped my cheeks hard with the palms of my hands to drive away any
distracting thoughts, then started pouring mana into my hands.

———————❖———————

In the dorm for the top students of Märchen Academy, Charles Hall.

A certain room was dark, illuminated only by the moonlight shining
softly through the window.

Dorothy, dressed in her nightgown, was lying on the bed, her head turned
to the side.

In silence, she stared blankly at the moonlight shining on the floor.

“…”

She had countless questions for Isaac.

***Why are you so strong? What is the reason you’re training so hard,
pretending to be weak and not using your full strength?***

***What is your reason for antagonizing the demons while hiding your
identity?***

He was already strong enough to be considered an Archwizard, which made
it impossible for Dorothy to understand his eccentricity. It didn’t even
feel like he was honing his basic skills like *‘a great master
perfecting the fundamentals.’*

Above all.

‘Why do you feel that way…?’

Earlier, Isaac had lied. He didn’t reveal the real reason for training
to death like that.

Why, then, did she see emotions of ‘concern’ and ‘affection’ on his
lying face?

Her \[Emotion Detection\] could never be wrong. Isaac was clearly
worried about her.

‘You lied to me, for my sake…?’

What connection could there be between Isaac’s lies and his concern for
Dorothy?

‘Besides, I’m not someone to be worried about…’

In the first place, it was ridiculous that he, the most powerful person
at Märchen Academy, would be worried about her.

It was comical.

\[Dorothy. What are you doing up so late?\]

A graceful voice rang at Dorothy’s bedside.

As she turned her head, a white cat with a pink ribbon on her tail
reflected in her eyes.

It was her 5-star familiar, ‘Ella’.

\[You’ve been tossing and turning ever since we got here… Oh my, are you
in love or something?\]

“You still haven’t digested the firecrackers yet, what are you talking
about?”

\[Didn’t I tell you not to talk about firecrackers? Just thinking about
it makes me sick…!\]

Dorothy said teasingly as she opened her half-closed eyes, Ella was
furious.

The day Isaac defeated the demon, Ella ate the firecrackers he had left
near Professor Fernando.

It was to give Isaac time to escape. If the firecrackers had exploded on
time and the academy’s personnel who heard the sound had come running,
Isaac would have been caught in the act.

The academy’s personnel weren’t stupid.

‘I’m worried…’

Dorothy stroked Ella’s soft body, and Ella closed her eyes, enjoying her
touch.

‘I wonder if the President knows about my curse?’

Isaac seemed like an ordinary man on the surface, but he was the
strongest person she had ever met, far beyond Dorothy’s wildest
assumptions. If so, there was a high possibility that he had also
figured out the true nature of the curse she possessed.

If there was a connection between Isaac’s lie and Dorothy’s curse, it
might be related to the ‘demons’.

“Hmmmmm.”

Dorothy had been stroking Ella and thinking for so long that her brain
started to overheat.

\[Dorothy? Dorothy!\]

As if her brain had been pushed to the limit and exploded, she started
spacing out.

Using her brain was her Achilles’ heel.

———————❖———————

The dueling evaluation had finally resumed.

I thought things must have gone according to the original scenario,
except for the appearance of Leafa the Illusive. But while having lunch
with Amy Holloway, I heard that Luce had knocked Ian out with a single
blow…

‘Why…?’

***Why on earth?***

Ian was supposed to reveal that he was a light element user during the
duel and leave a lasting impression on the students.

This was because of one of the official heroines, Ciel Carnedas. She had
already been involved with Ian during his practical training.

She was shocked to see Ian’s light magic. Because the *‘Promise with the
Heavenly Beings’* had been passed down through her family.

*‘If you find the Child of Light, please bring him to the Heavenly
Realm’.*

That was the promise Ciel’s great-great-grandfather made with the
Heavenly Beings when he went to the ‘Divine Realm’.

Thus after that, Ciel approached Ian and they became involved with one
another. As they continued to interact, her fondness for him grew, and
later she told Ian how to go to the Divine Realm, that is, Heaven.

Ian would need to travel to the Heavens to obtain the ultimate light
elemental weapon, the Luminous Sword. Even though Ian was a Master
Fainter, there would come a time when only he could help. Especially
later on, when the demon with immunity against all elements other than
light appeared, the bad ending would become a foregone conclusion if Ian
didn’t use \[Expelled from Paradise\] with his Luminous Sword.

“Whoa, what was that?”

“Am I not mistaken…?”

“Did you just use that… Is that light magic—?”

Fortunately, Ian successfully demonstrated the use of his light magic in
his duel against the dueling applicant Mateo Jordana, and Ciel Carnedas
was also among the crowd of students watching.

Only after seeing her eyes widen in surprise, could I finally breathe a
sigh of relief.

‘You must’ve been scared to death…’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, when Ian was dueling with Mateo, he was
determined not to use light magic.

However, after being easily defeated by Luce this time, he seemed to
have changed his mind, thinking, *‘If I don’t use my light magic first,
I won’t stand a chance.’* Of course, I figured out that idea through
\[Psychological Insight\].

Anyway.

There were no longer any problems with this scenario. ***Hooray!***

Now, regardless of the original story, I could focus on the duel.

Mateo was defeated by Ian’s unexpected use of light magic, but he
grasped the hand that he held out to him, creating a heartwarming scene.

“Hmph, as expected, no one can touch the strength, greatness, and mana
of my being!”

Tristan Humphrey was in a depressed mood at first, but his bravado and
self-esteem were boosted by his easy victories in his duels against
other students.

“…”

Luce Eltania won, winning casually with water magic.

“Is this all your strength?”

During the course of the tournament, the groups were switched each time,
so I got to see Kaya Astrean’s duel as well.

Just like Luce, she easily subdued her opponent with wind magic, but she
showed her opponent a degree of mercy in giving and receiving attacks.

“Aaahhhhhhhhh!”

Amy Holloway ran away in terror, but when she was cornered, she squeezed
her eyes shut and unleashed a barrage of fire magic at her opponent.

Her opponent collapsed, looking like a burnt chicken, leaving Amy
looking visibly flustered.

“Huhu. I didn’t expect someone from Class C to challenge me to a duel.
Was this all for the sake of panting like a dog? Aaah, how pathetic, how
unsightly… But I’ll give you credit for having some courage. Great. To a
nasty pig like you, I’ll give you the honor of being trampled under my
feet.”

Rose Red Rivera laughed with a, “Hoho,” and began to excitedly stomp on
her opponent, a male student, with her foot as he fell to the ground.

The faces of the students who were watching were priceless.

The expression of the boy who was being trampled on was very happy. He
looked like he could die happy right now.

“Next! Class D Isaac, Class C Donnelly Jenkins, forward!”

The referee called my name and I stepped up onto the arena; across from
me was a Class C male student with which I had applied for a duel.

He straddled the fine line between Class B and Class C, and was a
perfect opponent to measure my combat power against.

“All skills are unrestricted! Surrendering is prohibited for one minute.
Now, show respect to your opponent and engage in a duel.”

Kaya’s sparkling eyes…

Luce’s meaningful gaze…

Mateo’s tense eyes…

Amy’s supportive eyes…

Tristan’s inferiority complex flaring…

Rosé’s annoyed glare….

Ian’s focused eyes…

…They all turned to me in unison.

“Ready…!”

Even though I was the weakest, I was able to become stronger by playing
an active role in teaching those demons who the person in charge was.

I was sure I could compete with the top Class C students now.

“Begin the duel!”

With the referee’s shout, I conjured \[Frostfire\] in both hands.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ Act 3, Chapter 1.

The dueling part was coming to an end.

———————❖———————

“Hey, you worked hard!”

“You worked hard, Enoch!”

“Hahahahaha! Enoch, your sword skills are as good as ever!”

It was an eerie night when a party of four adventurers – two warriors,
one wizard, and one cleric – were on their way back to their inn after a
day of dungeon exploration.

Today’s harvest was quite abundant. From Halkori’s claws to Demyrus’
wings, and even the gold and silver treasures that the monsters were
hoarding in the storerooms. The bags of harvest held by the two strong
warriors looked very reassuring.

Now that the quest received from the guild office was safely completed,
it was time to celebrate by throwing a party and drinking to their
heart’s content.

In the midst of all the excitement, the group was walking through the
forest when they suddenly came across an open space bathed in moonlight;
the group of adventurers felt a presence and stopped in their tracks.

“Wait.”

The next words were unnecessary, for their gazes turned to the same
place – a woman around 3 meters tall was strolling along the beach; her
tattered dress and ashen skin seemed to ooze with age, but in her open
mouth, the number of sharp teeth were too numerous to count.

*Stop.*

The woman’s feet stopped. In an instant, her head bizarrely twisted
toward the group of adventurers.

They held their breath at the chilling spectacle.

Suddenly, the woman’s mouth was stretched open, forming a grotesque
smile.

\[Good morning, everyone!\]

Under the dark night sky, the woman greeted them cheerfully.

\[Can you hear the birds chirping? How cute, how cute!\]

Despite the woman’s excessive hand gestures and body language, there was
no chirping of cute birds. There was only silence.

The adventurers’ group sensed an unusual aura and drew their weapons.

Soon, the hoot of an owl rang out.

\[Yes, this sound! Hoot, hoot, hoot, hoot!!!!!!!!!!!!\]

The gray-skinned woman swayed her body from side to side like a trumpet.

She whispered rapidly, then began to make a duck cry, blood splattering
from her mouth.

\[Ah! Cute thing! Do you have any cute ones too? It’s cute, it’s cute,
it’s cute!\]

Then, as if the woman’s cries were a signal flare, the adventurers’
familiars were forcibly summoned

“What is this…!”

“Zordyk!!”

The familiars were engulfed in darkness mana with pained expressions.

Soon, countless familiars were summoned around the woman; an army of
animal-like and hideous-looking magic beasts were under her command.

All of them were magic beasts who had once been someone’s familiars, and
as they drained the darkness mana, they looked like puppets that had
lost their will.

Even the adventurers’ familiars forgot their masters and flew toward the
woman. After being consumed by the darkness mana, the familiars became
no different from the rest of the woman’s magic beast army.

\[From now on, I am your new owner. Aah, how cute, how cute, how cute…\]

The woman caressed the four new familiars, and her eyes took in the
branding on their bodies, evidence of their contracted master-servant
relationship. The sight made her uncomfortable, so she frowned in
annoyance.

\[Alas, there’s no use, it’s okay, this stepmother will set you free!\]

Soon, the army of familiars closed in and attacked the adventurers. It
was a one-sided battle.

The four adventurers, who seemed to have bright futures ahead of them,
fell prey to their familiars and departed from this world.

The woman summoned her familiar army back and in an instant, the army of
familiars was engulfed in darkness mana, and their figures disappeared.

\[Smells better…. It’s cute, smelly…. Does the *Child of Light* have a
cute one?\]

Vera the Summoner, a demon with absolute domination over familiars.

She walked back to Märchen Academy, staggering with each step.

Chapter 33: - Luce (1)
======================

༺ **Luce (1)**༻

The academy issued a statement to the students after the dueling
evaluation was over; they were currently in the process of investigating
the cause of the frequent appearance of demons, and would prepare the
best safety measures to ensure that no students were harmed.

The curriculum proceeded as normal, as if nothing had happened. Some
students protested that the academy was hiding something and demanded
the truth, but they were in the minority.

‘Of course, it’s not a logical situation.’

An existence that threatens people’s lives had appeared several times,
yet the academy was going back to its normal operation even though a
student or professor almost died.

Even if demons were regarded as natural disasters, it didn’t make sense.

However, in reality, the board of directors, the principal, and the
academic staff were working day and night to get the situation under
control. Unless they had been living under a rock, there was no student
who didn’t know that fact.

However, by the end of the first semester of year 1 – the Thunderbird
Subjugation – the matter would escalate and would become too big,
forcing the Imperial Knights to eventually intervene.

And this served as an opportunity to bring together the so-called
*‘Golden Generation’,* which included a relatively insignificant
princess, a saintess who handled divine power (physical), and a
sociopathic priestess from the East. The princess had planned to enter
the school from the beginning, the saintess came because of a sense of
justice to face the darkness of this world… no, it was because of her
love for winning. And then there was the priestess, who had a plan of
her own.

I wasn’t certain, but it appeared that those with special status or
birth tended to have a peculiar way of thinking. If I survived, they,
the Golden Generation, would become my juniors.

‘But that’s for later…’

What mattered now was that the original story had been greatly twisted.

During the dueling evaluation, the final boss of Act 6, Scene 3, Leafa
the Illusive, appeared and because of his loose lips, he had leaked some
crucial information to Professor Fernando.

The very existence of a ‘mole’.

***How did I, a commoner, know about this, you ask?*** Of course, I
found out thanks to observing the main academy staff through
\[Psychological Insight\] and it detailed *‘Worried about the future
because the demons have a mole at the academy.’*

In that case, I should prepare for an **IF** scenario – when the truth
that Alice is the ‘mastermind’ becomes revealed sooner than in the
original scenario.

For reference, even Dorothy’s \[All in the World\] couldn’t discover
that Alice was the person controlling everything from behind the scenes.
It was because Alice had a unique trait called the \[Red Queen’s
Paradox\].

To conclude, no one could read Alice’s psychology or essence.

‘Anyway, I have to prepare for a situation where Alice’s identity is
revealed sooner than expected…’

「Rock Collapse (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Koooong───!!*

“Ugghh!!”

***Aaaahh!!***

***It hurts!!***

“I-I thought I told you to keep it within moderation, nothing higher
than 3-stars…!”

The yellow glowing boulders slammed into my body, crashing into each
other, causing an explosion of mana.

The impact sent my body tumbling across the grass before slamming into a
tree.

Whew, that was a surprise…

I groaned and managed to raise my upper body.

The being that had knocked me off my feet was a small golem, tilting its
head. Its body was made of solid stone that looked incredibly hard.

It was my 3-star rock element familiar, Eden.

\[Kyuu─?\]

***Don’t pretend to be cute while tilting your head. It doesn’t suit
you.***

\[Eden\] **Lv:** 48

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to look cute to you. Kyu.\]

Two days ago, I had the opportunity to summon a familiar during ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 3, Chapter 2, Familiar」. The students took
turns summoning familiars using the summoning circle.

I was worried that there would be unexpected variables like there were
in the dueling evaluation, but fortunately, it ended safely, without any
incident.

One could summon up to 4-star familiars with the Familiar Summoning
Circle. From 5-stars and above, you had to meet in person and sign a
contract.

A 3-star like Eden exceeded my expectations, so I excitedly signed a
contract with him.

The main character, Ian Fairytale, summoned a fire element familiar
named ‘Rex,’ as per the original story. A whopping 4-stars. He resembled
a newborn Tyrannosaurus, and according to the original plot of the
familiar part, Ian and Rex would soon have a confrontation to clarify
their master-servant relationship.

As a result, Rex would become the partner of the Master Fainter
protagonist, and this time, he would win because the demons weren’t his
opponent.

‘Well, that’s that.’

I should focus on my familiar.

I stood up from my seat, rubbing my battered stomach. I could endure
this kind of pain three or four more times… well, not really.

It seemed that the penalty for disobeying orders, pain, had not come to
Eden.

Disobedience was judged by the familiar’s perception. They must be aware
of the fact that they were not following their master’s orders. Eden
seemed to think that he followed my orders well.

In other words, it was also proof that his intelligence was so low that
he didn’t even realize that the spell he had just cast was a 4-star
spell.

Well, this was something that could be explained and taught.

“Well, it certainly hurt less than I thought it would.”

I was testing the ‘Elemental Bracelet’, an unexpected item I obtained by
defeating Leafa the Illusive, with Eden.

The Elemental Bracelet increased my resistance to a specific element by
’40’. Elemental magic of a certain level would no longer be able to harm
me.

This effect lasted 24 hours, i.e., once 24 hours have passed after the
bracelet effect was activated, the increased elemental resistance would
return to its original state. Then I could use the effect once more.

Presently, I had set my elemental resistance to the rock element. To
modify the setting, all I had to do was simply adjust the ring attached
to the bracelet to the pattern of the desired element engraved on the
bracelet.

As it turned out, the effect was more amazing than I had expected. It
didn’t hurt unless I was hit by high-star spells, and I was much less
likely to be pushed away.

Even if I got hit with 4-star magic, it just hurt and that was it. Oh,
who am I kidding? It hurt like hell, but I would have passed out without
the Elemental Bracelet.

What if I was wearing the Elemental Bracelet during the dueling
evaluation?

When Tristan Humphrey unleashed his \[Whirlwind\], I could have given
him a proper blow without being blown away.

“Eden! 3-stars! Remember, 3-stars! What you just cast was a 4-star, so
don’t use it anymore!”

\[Okay!\]

Eden replied, raising his right arm in the air.

His voice was more on the neutral side.

Pretending to be cute didn’t suit him, but was it because he was my
familiar? My heart seemed to be filling up with affection…

「Rock Burial (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Kudududududududududududu───!!*

“Ugh!!!”

\[Kyuu?\]

This blockhead!

\* \* \*

If you had to choose the tallest building on the Märchen Academy site,
it was definitely the ‘Hegel Magic Tower’. However, since it only had
occupancy rights on the academy site, it was safe to say that it was a
kind of private company that had nothing to do with the academy.

The Hegel Magic Tower was home to many wizards from Märchen Academy.
This was because, in exchange for occupying part of the academy site,
additional points were given to Märchen Academy graduates who took the
entry test. The tower itself was so prestigious that it was often
mentioned as a possible career path for Märchen Academy students.

The entire top floor was used exclusively as a research laboratory for a
single wizard.

It was a place only those who opened their heart to her were allowed to
enter. Professor Fernando Frost stepped inside.

It was a large circular room; many books were floating in the air, and
the walls were lined with them. Traces of alchemy were everywhere, and
the high ceiling was made of glass, allowing a clear view of the sky.

In the center of the lab, a female wizard with auburn hair sprawled
comfortably on the floor. With a small stature and physique, she read
her book calmly while waving her legs.

Aria Lilias, Fernando’s teacher and the Tower Master of Hegel Magic
Tower.

She raised her head and glanced at Fernando with an impassive face, then
turned her gaze back to the book she was reading.

“I came to say hello, master.”

“What happened?”

“I wanted to ask you something.”

“You did not even ask how I am doing first? As expected of my disciple,
losing your manners.”

Aria Lilias had a habit of speaking in simple sentences.

“Your question?”

“Have you heard the latest news from the academy? About the demons and
black monster?”

“Repeat that nonsense.”

“On the first day of the dueling evaluation, I almost lost my life to a
demon.”

The news of her disciple’s near-death experience caught Aria’s
attention. It was a fact she knew, of course. Since Hegel Magic Tower
was located near Märchen Academy, she couldn’t help but hear news about
the academy.

“But the black monster protected me, and was even able to use even
9-star magic without difficulty. It is presumed that monster has already
reached the realm of an Archwizard.”

“So?”

“How do you perceive this? The identity of someone who suddenly appears
one day and vanishes immediately after.”

“…”

A black monster.

It first appeared during the first-year class placement evaluation of
the Magic Department, and defeated a demon that appeared out of nowhere.

During this dueling evaluation, that monster protected Professor
Fernando by overpowering the powerful demon that had created another
world.

“…What does the academy think?”

“They see that monster as a demon who rebelled against the other
demons.”

“What do you think?”

“…”

“I assume you have already guessed it, but that monster is probably one
of your students.”

It was something Fernando had already thought of, so he didn’t question
it.

“One thing is clear, that monster was trying to protect you.”

Fernando’s figure was reflected in Aria’s profound gaze.

“My advice is, do not interfere. Do not pry into the secrets of someone
who is trying to protect you for no reason. Just analyze and solve the
cause of the demons’ appearance.”

“May I ask why?”

“Hey.”

“…!”

In the blink of an eye, Aria’s face was right in front of Fernando’s.
She had levitated her body with telekinesis magic.

From a distance so close that their faces were almost touching, with an
emotionless face, she spoke in a sarcastic tone.

“You still don’t understand? That monster came after observing an
anomaly of this academy that even I had not noticed. It came to protect
the people at this academy. You can’t help, so don’t do anything
stupid.”

“…”

He knew that the black monster was on the academy’s side and was trying
to protect people.

Fernando testified before the Truth Investigation Committee that the
monster was not an enemy, but after numerous discussions, the conclusion
was reached that *‘The black monster is likely to be a demon that
rebelled against the demons.’* How else could he have known when and
where the demons would appear?

Most of the faculty were afraid of the monster. But Fernando was
different; he wanted to be on the monster’s side, just as the student
had been on his.

“Of course, master.”

Fernando answered in a calm voice.

Darkness began to tinge the sky.

Luce Eltania, the first-year head of the Magic Department, went to the
training ground for the first time in a while to practice lightning
magic and was on her way back to her dormitory.

With all of the students’ attention focused on her, she felt overwhelmed
and left after half an hour.

Even when she left, the students exclaimed, “As expected of the top
student! Does that mean she only needs to practice that much…!?” Which
made her feel even more overwhelmed.

“Oh, really? That’s hilarious!”

“Hehehe.”

Suddenly, Luce’s eyes caught sight of the girls passing by on the
street. They were walking side by side, chatting happily.

“Later, see you tomorrow!”

“See you tomorrow!”

As the road diverged, the female students waved goodbye and parted ways.

“…”

It was an ordinary sight. Eating together, chatting together, and at the
end of the day, looking forward to the next time they saw each other.

It was just an ordinary daily life for the other students, who she
always saw and never paid any attention to.

But for some reason, today, the sight of them stirred something in
Luce’s heart.

Suddenly, the image of a man came to her mind. Luce’s footsteps began to
take a different course, and instead of going straight to the dormitory,
she took a roundabout path. The place she arrived at was near the corner
of the Butterfly Garden.

‘Hmmmm, just passing through, just passing through…’

Even if she took this path, she could still reach the dormitory, so it
was the right way back. It’s just that it would take 5 times longer than
her normal route.

The road at the end of Butterfly Garden was usually deserted. Only the
sound of bugs echoed loudly.

‘There it is.’

Luce’s gaze darted in all directions, scanning left and right, until she
spotted Isaac in the corner of the garden. It was indeed a coincidence.

On the first day of the dueling evaluation, Isaac had succumbed to the
magic of Tristan Humphrey. Everyone present must have felt the stark
difference in magic power between the two.

How disappointed Isaac must have been when he felt that insurmountable
wall. On the contrary, he pretended to be unaffected by it, and the
memory of him, who looked more pitiful, came to mind again.

However, frustration did not deter him. During his subsequent duels, he
showed a burning desire.

‘I was happy.’

Seeing this, Luce felt a sense of satisfaction.

As she reflected on the dueling evaluation in her head, she suddenly
remembered the incident of the demon’s appearance.

‘Greung…’

Greung had appeared again. It was said that he protected Professor
Fernando and then disappeared again. If she had focused her mana
perception, she might have noticed him appearing. It was a pity she
didn’t.

Every time she thought of the monster, she felt a subtle emotion she had
never felt before. It was not an uncomfortable feeling, but more of a
favorable one.

Recently, Luce realized the true nature of said emotion. This feeling
was the feeling of ‘wanting to get to know someone….’

For this reason, she spent a considerable amount of time pondering the
concept of ‘friendship’ through books. But the more she did, the more
difficult it was for her to understand what a friend was.

How do people understand and accept this ambiguous concept as if it were
so natural? It was really strange.

And recently, there was one more person she wanted to be friends with.

The wavy, silver-blue haired male student who came into view was that
person… but.

‘What is he doing?’

Luce was taken aback. For whatever reason, Isaac was…getting beat up by
the magic of his own familiar?

Isaac’s condition looked awful. His eyes were forced open, his breathing
was ragged. His condition looked precarious, as if he would collapse at
any moment.

Suddenly, water mana began to gather next to Luce. The mana took the
form of a small killer whale, and with a light coating of water mana on
its body, it began to swim through the air like an ocean, shouting.

\[Emergency! Emergency! A familiar is beating its master!\]

It sounded as if a little boy were shouting in an innocent voice.

The little killer whale magic beast, ‘Bello’. It was a 4-star familiar
who responded to Luce’s call during the familiar summoning.

\[Bello Emergency Dispatch! No violence! No violence!\]

“Go back… Huh?”

Luce was trying to unsummon Bello, who was about to fly toward Isaac,
while saying “go back”.

Suddenly, Isaac’s eyes rolled back, and his body slumped to the side.

*Thud-*

He fell onto the grass and lost consciousness.

“…!”

Luce’s heart sank; she didn’t bother to recall Bello, but instead
hurriedly ran towards the unconscious Isaac.

\[Incident occurred! Incident occurred! Arrested for beating your
master, dude!\]

\[K-kyu…?!\]

Passing through the noisy familiar, Lucy held the unconscious Isaac’s
upper body in her arms.

\* \* \*

***Sometimes I dream about my 3-pyeong studio in Sillim-dong.***

The already tiny room was half-filled with thick books; I spread three
open books on my desk, trapping myself in a narrow world. I looked like
an ordinary civil service examinee.

I felt as if I were walking through a tunnel that was pitch black and
had no end in sight.

I wondered if I could reach the end of this tunnel.

Sometimes, when I felt like my heart was about to collapse at that
thought, I would mercilessly slap my thighs. Otherwise, my narrow world
would shrink and my existence itself would cease to exist.

The pain was a means of maintaining my sanity.

‘But why am I reminiscing about that time?’

…I remembered. I kept receiving Eden’s spells to experiment with the
Elemental Bracelet in various ways. The pain reminded me of my
examination life.

It seems the damage must have accumulated and the fatigue that had been
building up must have caused me to pass out.

***So, am I just lying there in the corner of the garden?***

***No, my body is warm and cozy. I’m pretty sure this sensation is…***

‘A bed?’

My eyes fluttered open.

***What kind of bed is this?***

Then, my eyes caught the sight of a familiar yet unfamiliar ceiling. I
wasn’t talking about déjà vu. It was a familiar ceiling in ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱, but it was an unfamiliar ceiling to me as Isaac.

“What?”

I raised my upper body. Even at a glance, this was a luxurious room.
Even the bed I was lying on was unnecessarily large. It was the size
that usually comes to mind when imagining the bed of rich people.

I looked around. No matter how I looked at it, this place… it looked
like the interior of Charles Hall, the dormitory for top-tier students
that I saw in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. In addition, looking at the
dressing table and interior, it seemed to be a woman’s room.

Huh? Wait a second.

‘A woman’s room!?’

All dormitories were divided into male and female dormitories. Of
course, it was strictly forbidden to enter the dormitory of the opposite
sex.

***Why am I in such a forbidden area?***

Soon, the damp towel that was stuck to my forehead fell off. It was a
neatly folded towel.

‘Was I being taken care of?’

My mind raced. Who brought me to Charles Hall? Kaya? Was it Kaya?

It was then.

\[The victim woke up! The victim woke up!\]

A small killer whale flew in front of me, swimming through the air as if
it were the sea.

Now that I think about it, I think I might have heard this familiar’s
voice right before I passed out.

And I knew who the owner of this familiar was because I had played
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ until I got tired of it.

“Are you awake?”

“…!”

It was a soft yet soothing voice, like the moonlight, it seemed to
seduce my ears.

When I turned my eyes to the head of the bed, my eyes caught the sight
of a girl with rose gold hair sitting somewhere.

One of the official heroines with a graceful beauty, with morpho
butterfly-colored hair ties adorning either side of her head.

She was scanning me with eyes that seemed to contain the blue ocean.

It was Luce Eltania, the top seat of the first year’s Magic Department
at Märchen Academy.

<span id="0033_34_-_Luce_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 34: - Luce (2)
======================

༺ **Luce (2)**༻

“Bello, go back.”

As I watched Luce unsummon the killer whale familiar, Bello, I organized
the situation in my head.

While I was experimenting with the Elemental Bracelet, I passed out and
collapsed. Even though my body was exhausted, suddenly losing
consciousness was unexpected.

I fainted and was seemingly saved by Luce, who happened to be passing
by.

‘Luce?’

On the surface, there was nothing unusual about this sort of situation.
However, the problem was that it involved Luce.

Unless you took the Luce route, she would display her true nature as an
outsider by living the entire first semester her way, without caring
about anyone else. She wasn’t the kind of character to get upset when
she sees a person like me lying on the ground.

It would have been much more in-character for her to just say, ‘He must
have fallen asleep.’ She was the kind of character who left people
alone, dead or alive.

This made me feel uncomfortable. I opened Luce’s status window.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 115

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Relieved that you seem to be okay.\]

Her level was 5 higher than when I first saw her, but that wasn’t
important right now.

Her psychology was strange.

‘Why are you worried about me?’

***Even if she had saved me because of her mood today, why would she
feel relieved?***

That couldn’t be the case. As Isaac, the only interaction I had with
Luce was when I gave a passionate performance worthy of winning the Best
Actor of the Year award during the class placement evaluation.

Then the conclusion is…

‘Could it be that I was caught?’

My face became pensive at the thought.

─ ‘What’s your name?’

─ ‘Greung. (Greung)’

I recalled the events of the class placement evaluation. Had Luce
realized that I was Greung, the one who saved her?

If so, the pieces would fit together like a puzzle.

I touched my forehead with my right hand. ***Oh my god.***

“Does your head hurt?”

“What happened?”

“I was just passing by and *‘accidentally’* saw you pass out, so I used
magic to bring you with me.”

Luce emphasized the word *‘accidentally’*, her tone as gentle as the
moonlight.

Ah, now I’m stumped. How did she realize…

The reason I brought a magic cloak of disguise during the class
placement evaluation was because of Luce’s perceptive eye; if she had
realized my identity, she would have reported it to the academy’s
administration.

There was also another reason. It was to cover up the fact that ‘Isaac
saved Luce’.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, one of the conditions to win Luce’s favor
was to protect or save her during the class placement evaluation. And if
that happened, the player had one more thing to worry about.

‘Because even Luce’s likability is a bad ending factor.’

Luce was the type of person who, once she opens her heart to someone,
opens it fully. Maybe that was why the speed at which her likability
increased was speeding up like a runway train. Even without doing
anything special, the likability meter would rise.

If the player didn’t regulate her likability by behaving appropriately,
the likability meter would eventually burst.

Then, the player would face ‘Extra Bad End N.13’.

An ‘Extra Bad End’ referred to a bad ending that had nothing to do with
the main storyline. It was similar to getting killed in a car accident
while walking down the street.

Among them, N.13 「Bird Cage」.

The main character, Ian Fairytale, was kidnapped and imprisoned by Luce,
who had become his psychotic lover.

It was an ending where he helplessly met his end in her loving care.

Therefore, Luce’s likability was one of the factors I needed to be wary
of.

“…Is this your room?”

“Yes.”

Anyway, there was really no other way to explain this other than that my
identity was revealed…

All the bruises on my body were healed. When I pointed out the wounds on
my body, Luce explained.

“I’ve healed most of them myself. I know how to use healing magic too. I
think you’ve been pushing yourself too hard… Lie down some more, I’ll
wet a towel and give it to you.”

***Don’t be so nice. You are not that kind of character.***

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1)」

I pondered while Luce picked up the towel off my leg and soaked it with
water magic.

I hadn’t realized there would be such a variable. How and when did she
find out?

“I’m ready. Lie down some more.”

The bad end variable with rose-gold hair was wringing the wet towel into
a bowl placed next to me, then folded it neatly and approached me.

Startled, I reached out and stopped her.

“………?”

“Wait, hold on.”

“………?”

Luce looked at me with a puzzled expression.

“I’m grateful that you saved me, but why did you bring me to your room?”

“Then where should I have taken you?”

“There was the academy hospital. And the infirmary was also close…”

“… I didn’t think of it. I’ve never been to those places before.”

It seemed that a hospital room as an option was hard for Luce to
imagine, since she had a strong body and high mana.

“How did you manage to get here without being noticed?”

“I didn’t run into anyone on my way here. Why, is there a problem?”

Perhaps it was just good timing.

“No, nothing…”

I couldn’t think of anything else to say, so I just took the towel. It
was cold.

I touched my forehead and felt a definite fever. I placed the cold towel
on my warm forehead like a hand warmer.

“Lie down. I’ll bring you some warm soup.”

As Luce slid off the bed, I weighed my options and decided to ask her,
“Do you know me? Why are you taking such good care of me?”

Luce’s shoulders shook as she stopped dead in her tracks.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[At a loss for words and doesn’t know
what to say to you.\]

Ah, never mind about that. I’m just curious what kind of feelings Luce
has towards me…

“…I do not know either.”

Luce’s cheeks flushed and left a meaningful remark.

‘Crazy.’

An inexperienced response. It was a reaction that would only appear in a
youth romance story.

“Isaac.”

Luce turned around to look at me. She even called my first name… I had
never even told her my name before.

Luce hesitated, trying to figure out what to say, with flushed cheeks.

“To be honest, I’ve known you for a long time…”

‘This is not good.’

***Not that introduction, stop…!***

This uneasy air. The romantic atmosphere. And a mood where a confession
without context wouldn’t be out of place.

From the moment Luce confessed her feelings, she would quickly become
obsessed. It was a case where the fact that she confessed would make her
feelings grow stronger.

But… it was too soon.

Could it be that my face was more to Luce’s liking than Ian’s? Is that
why the likability was increasing much faster than in the original game?

“I saw you the other day by chance, and I’ve been watching you ever
since. And I’ve been wondering, why do you train so hard…?”

Luce spoke in a calm voice, barely above a whisper.

I’m sure she must be curious. When I was Greung, I displayed immense
power. It was incongruous to see a guy like that practice magic to death
that Luce found so questionable.

“The other students train hard, too.”

“They don’t push themselves to the point of nosebleeds every day like
you do.”

She saw, ‘Every day’.

“So, I’ve been watching you and thinking a lot. So, I guess what I’m
trying to say is….”

“Ohhh, what is that?!”

A very unnatural change of topic. I couldn’t help it. I wasn’t ready to
hear her utter those words.

My head was still hurting because of the early appearance of Act 6,
Chapter 3 final boss.

The last thing I needed was one more bad end variable to worry about.

“Ah, that.”

Luce was kind enough to explain the names and uses of the objects I
pointed at.

Each time, I would point to a seemingly mundane object and exclaim,
“Wow, that’s amazing! What’s that?” and ask questions.

“What’s this? It’s luxurious.”

“Chessboard. I got it as a present once.”

“What’s this? It has a nice design.”

“It’s my family’s ceremonial knife. It was in my luggage when I came to
the academy, so I left it here for now.”

“What’s this? It’s beautiful.”

“It’s a grimoire I received from someone special to me. It’s made of
human skin.”

“What’s this? It’s cute.”

“It’s a cursed doll used in black magic. I’ve heard that if you put a
human’s hair in here and poke it with a needle, that person will feel
pain. It’s probably superstition, but do you want to try it?”

Before I knew it, Luce was leading me around the room, pointing out and
explaining to me all sorts of mundane objects.

“Oh, there are a lot of books here.”

“You can’t touch those.”

As I spoke while looking at the bookshelf, Luce’s voice, which had been
as soft as the moonlight, turned cold.

For a moment, I felt a murderous aura. I quickly turned my head away
from the bookshelf. Yes, of course it was because I was scared.

The bookshelf was lined with things she was too embarrassed to show me.
Nothing special, just books with titles such as “How to Make Friends,”
“What is Friendship,” and “How to Open up to Others.”

***…You really made up your mind to open up your heart.***

“But are you okay with walking around?”

“I’m fine, thanks to you.”

I had been looking around the room with the towel on my forehead from
earlier.

My head felt light-headed, but it wasn’t serious enough to be
noticeable.

“This…?”

Again, I almost reflexively asked, “What is this?”

What caught my eye was a small cylindrical box. It sat on her desk while
it bathed in the light from the luminescent lamp, showing off the color
of black pearls.

Luce stood next to me and narrowed her eyes. As if to say, ***don’t ask
me what it is*.**

There was a moment of silence, and I was about to pretend I didn’t see
it.

“Isaac.”

Luce spoke to me in a soft, yet almost seductive voice, as if drawing me
in.

“Do you think the ‘Witches of Calamity’ are all bad?”

**…Why set the mood by asking something like that out of nowhere?**

“Why is that?”

“Just… I suddenly felt like asking.”

Luce stared at the small, black cylindrical box, and then subtly lowered
her head.

Witch of Calamity.

That was how history referred to the vilest of witches, those who
possessed natural magic talent and committed inhumane crimes against
humanity.

They’ve done unspeakable acts of cruelty, so it was only natural for
anyone to consider them as ‘bad’ existences.

But it didn’t take me long to realize why Luce was asking the question.

Inside that black box were Luce’s eyeballs. A Witch of Calamity had
plucked out Luce’s eyes, preserved it, and handed it to her. Luce kept
the box on her desk because she wanted to remember the witch at every
moment.

Luce’s current eyes were implanted by the Witch of Calamity, and that
seemingly cruel act was done to protect Luce’s life.

Which, incidentally, explains why her eyesight was beyond that of
humans.

“…No.”

I shook my head and replied indifferently.

Because I had seen all the stories in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I knew what kind of person the ‘Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath’ was like,
she was the *Witch of Calamity* that Luce missed so much.

Contrary to her unfair notoriety as the Witch of Calamity who lured many
children into a candy store and brutally murdered them, she was someone
who had sacrificed everything for the sake of children.

Although I knew I shouldn’t attempt to use my knowledge as an advantage
to increase Luce’s likability, I didn’t want to deny the person she
missed so much.

“I don’t think they’re necessarily all bad.”

Luce shook her head in disbelief.

“But it could be a story made up by people. I haven’t actually seen a
Witch of Calamity myself. How can I be sure?”

Luce stared in my direction, wide-eyed, obviously surprised by my
answer.

I deliberately pretended not to see, and looked at other objects.

“Yeah, you’re right.”

Luce’s voice was a little teary, and a deep sense of loss could be felt.

The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath was a very dear person to Luce along
with her biological brother.

However, the witch was falsely accused of sacrificing many children to a
Mythological Magic Beast and had been sacrificed in front of Luce.

The people and the country have placed the blame on the Great Witch of
Heaven’s Wrath for all their sins.

Luce fell apart that day. She closed her heart towards people. The world
that she had tried to see as beautiful, even after being abandoned by
her biological parents, was so cruelly exposed to the 10-year-old girl.

“……….”

There was an air of awkwardness. Did I make things weird…

No, what should I do about her sniffles? How do I react to her forcing
back tears?

“Ah, I suddenly have a headache…”

***I can’t help it. I’ll just pretend to be in pain. It actually hurts,
but I have to act like it hurts even more.***

I swayed gracefully, yet naturally, and moved towards the bed. It was a
brilliant gesture, even in my own opinion.

As I sat on the bed, I tilted my head back and pressed the towel against
my forehead.

“Are you okay?”

“My head feels dizzy… I guess I must have overexerted myself.”

“Lie down. Oh, I’ll bring you some warm soup.”

I was not hungry, but I nodded because I wanted to buy myself some time
to think.

Luce looked at me with a look of concern for a moment before going into
the kitchen.

Suddenly, she poked her head around the corner and glared at me.

“Isaac.”

“Huh.”

“I want to be friends with you.”

“… Huh?”

What?

Upon hearing the words that contained a slight hint of amusement, I
looked straight ahead again.

Luce was staring at me, a pure smile drawn across her face. Soon, as if
embarrassed, she blushed and scratched her cheek while avoiding my eyes.

‘Friends…?’

It was bewildering.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there was no option to be friends with
Luce. Her likability just meant ‘romantic love’ from beginning to end.

“E-ever since I saw you training so hard, I thought I wanted to be
friends with you.”

“Huh?”

Come to think of it, didn’t she say she’d been watching me train every
day? That doesn’t necessarily mean she realized that I was *Greung*,
does it? There was no mention of me being *Greung* either.

Yes, it was a separate issue.

Luce simply happened to stumble upon me, was impressed by the way I
trained while nosebleeding, and began to feel friendly toward me…

I was not sure what kind of psychological change led to this, but it was
just a matter of accepting her words at face value.

In the first place, I should have suspected something when I saw a
plethora of books on Luce’s bookshelf titled ‘Friendship.’

Therefore, she…

‘She doesn’t know that I’m Greung, did she just want to be friends with
me?’

I felt like I had been hit hard in the back of the head. It was a
feeling similar to betrayal.

I had gone through all sorts of thoughts and emotions alone… I felt
embarrassed.

I couldn’t let my guard down just yet, but being friends was not so bad.

‘It’ll be fine.’

In the beginning, I was reluctant to be friends with someone like Kaya
Astrean.

But after I became friends with Amy Holloway and Mateo’s gang, I thought
about it and realized that it was okay to have a somewhat limited
approach to friendships.

I stand out when I meet Kaya, so we would meet in inconspicuous places,
although I rarely run into her these days.

Anyway, I was open to welcoming such a relationship.

I set the towel I’d been holding to my forehead aside, climbed out of
bed, and approached Luce.

My second favorite character in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Luce Eltania.

I flashed her a bright smile and held out my right hand.

“Of course.”

Luce’s eyes started to sparkle with life, and her rose-gold hair began
to rise slightly, as if electrostatically.

She tried to maintain her cool, keeping the corners of her mouth from
rising.

She took my outstretched hand.

To be friends. It wasn’t a big deal to me; it’s just something I have to
accept when asked to be friends.

But it must have been very difficult for someone like Luce.

She spent so many years of her life building walls between herself and
others, she may have had vague fears about what it meant to have a
friend.

She probably tried to understand the concept of friendship by reading
countless books on the subject, and even in her recent words, there were
likely a lot of worries and concerns.

In the game ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, whenever I spoke to the NPCs
wandering around, Luce’s dialogue was always “…….”. She always went
around alone, ate alone, and studied alone. She spent the first semester
of her freshman year alone like that.

However, there were moments when she, too, laughed with others. No
matter how skeptical she was of humanity, and no matter how hurt she
was, her true feelings were different from her outward behavior.

The crackling sound of the fireplace lasted for a long time, like a
lingering afterglow. After what seemed like an eternity, I broke the
silence.

“But you stand out too much, and that’s a little overwhelming for me. So
just because we’re friends doesn’t mean we can hang out all the time,
you know?”

“Uh, well…”

Luce’s voice trembled slightly. She couldn’t even make eye contact with
me. Was that the right answer? Did she even hear what I just said?

Well, she must have heard me.

“Anyway, I should probably go now.”

‘Luce didn’t realise that I was Greung’. Now that I knew that, I had no
reason to stay here any longer. Even if it hurts, I would just have to
toughen up. Even if I said I was going to rest, I couldn’t stay in the
girls’ dormitory forever.

“Oh, it would be nice if you had some soup before you go…”

“It’s okay. I appreciate the thought. Oh, do you have a cloak or
something by any chance?”

“A cloak? Yeah, I have one, why?”

Luce gave me a black cloak, and I draped it over my head and body like a
hijab.

“Eden.”

*Kyuuuuuu─*.

\[Kkuung!\]

Light brown mana gathered right besides me, and took the form of a small
golem familiar, ‘Eden’.

It landed on the floor while cheering with a cute cry.

“Luce, I have to go.”

“Ah, yes…”

Eden and I approached the window, and as we got closer, the scenery four
stories high appeared in front of my eyes. It was terrifying, but I had
no choice but to escape this way.

“Eden, create some rocks to land on. Make them in a stair-like
formation.”

\[Okay!\]

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」 「Rock Generation (Rock Element,
★1)」

*Sharararak─*

*Ddddddd─*

I created a crude ice ladder leading from the window to the ground
beneath it, Eden’s boulders surged up, creating a makeshift staircase.

“Luce, see you tomorrow!”

I waved at Luce before climbing over the edge of the window.

Suddenly, Luce’s eyes widened. Did I greet her in a weird way? Well, I
must have looked weird wearing the cloak like a hijab.

Eden immediately jumped out of the window, and I started descending the
ladder.

“Kyaaa! It’s a man!”

“Pervert! A pervert is here!”

Damn, my worst fears were realized.

I unsummoned Eden and hurriedly ran away from Charles Hall.

✦✧✦✧

Luce stood still for a long time after Isaac left.

The window was open and the cool night breeze gently rustled the
curtains.

“Tomorrow…”

Isaac’s greetings drifted through Luce’s mind like a lingering memory.

It was a greeting exchanged between people with a close relationship who
looked forward to their next meeting.

“Kyaa─! Catch the pervert!”

“Stop there, stalker!!”

*Roaring—!*

*Kwaguagwang─!*

Luce’s lips quirked into a smile.

She couldn’t even hear the sound of the riot outside the window, she
felt a thrill that felt as if her body was floating in the sky.

“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”

The voice that expressed her innermost thoughts drifted away in the
night breeze.

Beyond the window, the shining moonlight seemed exceptionally bright
tonight.

<span id="0034_35_-_Luce_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 35: - Luce (3)
======================

༺ **Luce (3)**༻

It was a very refreshing morning.

I hadn’t slept this well since the day I defeated Garzia the Hermit.

My fever quickly subsided. It seemed that the influence of Luce’s
healing magic was great.

My body felt light, so I left Doris Hall, the dorm for inferior
students, while I suppressed the urge to run.

Even though the interior facilities of Doris Hall were inferior and
outdated compared to the other dormitories, the surrounding garden with
lush greenery and Corinthian pillars combined with the design to create
a beautiful atmosphere.

I headed for the dorm gate with light steps. Suddenly, I caught a
glimpse of the male students leaving the dorm gates, they all had
strange looks on their faces. They were Doris Hall male students who,
like me, were leaving to attend the academy.

They were passing by the corner outside the entrance, sneaking glances
and side-eyeing.

‘What could everyone be blushing about?’

***It’s understandable if it’s Dorothy Heartnova.***

Thinking that as a joke, I walked out the door.

I glanced in the direction of the male students’ gazes. Then, for a
moment, my eyes were dazzled, like the halo effect that occurs when you
see a handsome or pretty celebrity. It was that kind of feeling.

A female student was standing there with her bag in both her hands. Her
long, straight, rose-gold hair was adorned with morpho
butterfly-coloured braids on either side of her head – a typical example
of a noble lady. The bright sunlight beating down on her made her beauty
stand out even more.

The moment her blue, oceanic eyes turned to me, I swallowed my breath.

“Hello, Isaac.”

It was her. Luce Eltania.

She greeted me with a bright smile and waved her right hand at me.

The gazes of the male students passing by turned to me this time.

***…I’m fucked.***

“The weather is nice today, isn’t it?”

I stared at Luce in disbelief as she blurted out a cliché comment that
sounded like it had been rehearsed many times before.

I should have been more cautious in this situation, but I suddenly ended
up casting an AOE aggro and was caught off guard.

“What’s wrong with your expression? Is the weather bad?”

This girl… The weather in my heart is what’s bad.

✦✧✦✧

It was obvious why I didn’t want the students to see me with Kaya.

I was still a Class D commoner.

If Kaya, a Class A noble from the Ducal House of Astrean, was seen
eating or hanging out with someone like me, it would naturally draw the
attention of other students. This would be very suitable as a topic of
conversation among first-year students.

And such rumors carried the risk of reaching Alice Carroll’s ears.

There was no need to consider the case of Alice simply passing by and
overhearing something. She was too busy as the Student Council
President, so she didn’t go to the student cafeteria, and instead
relaxed by getting drunk by herself.

What I had to be most wary of was Alice’s subordinate, who was among my
classmates. That person was a prospective member of the Student Council
recruited by Alice, and reported all the trends of the first-year
students they had learned to Alice.

It was not just the student council. In addition to the student council,
Märchen Academy also had a student faction called the “Four
Constellations.”

If we were to compare it to the Korean political system, members of the
Four Constellations who became part of the Student Council could be seen
as the ruling party, while the remaining members of the Four
Constellations would become part of the opposing party or other
political parties. Of course, the details were different.

There were also first-year prospective members who had already been
recruited into the Four Constellations in advance. These first-year
students gathered information and relayed it to their own factions. They
were spies of sorts.

This was done for two reasons. First, to gather information about the
students they wanted to recruit into their own faction. Second, to
identify potential candidates who could be useful for other factions.

Their ultimate goal was to produce a Student Council President from
within their own faction, and if they succeeded, they would be able to
wield enormous power within the academy.

Alice would probably use this as justification to find the troublemaker
and stop him.

Perhaps the fact that I used 5-star magic during the dueling evaluation
has reached her ears already. However, because there were other students
who were more impressive, that information was most likely buried.

But, well…

“Let’s eat together, Isaac.”

It was while eating lunch in the student cafeteria of the Magic
Department. Suddenly, Luce came up to me and put down her tray, and sat
down in the seat across from me.

The gazes of the students around me stung. They all looked surprised.
Some looked so flustered that orange juice was dripping from their
mouths.

“Luce Eltania is eating with Isaac…?”

“No way…”

“This is the first time I’ve seen the top seat smile.”

“Me too…”

“What kind of pairing is this…?”

Of course, the occasional meal with Amy or Mateo’s gang never received
such attention.

However, Luce was the first-year head of the Magic Department at the
prestigious Märchen Academy. She was the object of envy for many
students.

Moreover, she was famous for always being cold and indifferent.

Her dramatic mood reversal, where she only showed her bright side to me,
was bound to be noticed by the students.

‘It feels like having a meal with a celebrity.’

I wondered if this was the right time to use the phrase *‘I can’t tell
if my food is going through my mouth or nose,’* but that was exactly how
I felt right now.

“How was class?”

Luce smiled as she made another cliché comment.

“I remembered something I have to do. I’ll go first.”

“Ah…!”

I hurriedly got up with my tray and ran away quickly.

Luce reached out her arm towards me, as if telling me not to go, but I
couldn’t bring myself to give in.

✦✧✦✧

Orphin Hall, Class D classroom.

The students’ eyes were all drawn to me. The same went for Ian, who had
a band-aid on his cheek after fighting his familiar, Rex, yesterday.

No wonder, because right next to me sat the top seat with rose-gold hair
staring at me. She rested her arms on the desk and leaned her cheeks
against it, while the original owner of the seat was standing in the
back, unable to speak and fidgeting.

“Luce, the class is about to start. Shouldn’t you go back…?”

“I’ll go when class starts.”

This was the Class D classroom. Meanwhile, Luce belonged to Class A,
where only the top 5 students could enter, and she was even the top
student among them.

Just her presence in this classroom made the air feel incredibly heavy.

“What’s the relationship between the top seat and Isaac?”

“Isn’t there that feeling? Wanting to be close to the person you like…”

“The top seat?”

“Is that even a question?”

I could hear the whispers of the students. Seriously… it’s really making
me feel restless.

A choice I had made while I was relieved that she hadn’t recognized me
as Greung had led to such devastating consequences.

“Luce, I told you not to do this because you stand out a lot…”

“But I want to stay close to you…”

I spoke in a quiet voice, but the students with good ears seemed to
understand what I was saying, and their eyes widened.

“Did you hear that? Isaac is pressing the top seat to leave…!”

“Rather, the top seat is the one begging?”

“Are you kidding me?”

I was at a loss for words here.

Just then, Professor Fernando Frost walked into the classroom.

“Let’s start class now… hmm?”

Professor Fernando, who was standing in front of the podium, was about
to speak but hesitated when he saw me and Luce.

“You are Class A’s Luce Eltania. What are you doing here?”

“…….”

*Goooooooo-*

Luce’s eyes snapped toward Professor Fernando. It was a cold glare, like
a murderous threat.

And for a brief moment, all of the students in the room could feel a
strong flow of mana. I didn’t need \[Psychological Insight\] to know
that they were all scared.

It gave me chills and made my whole body trembled…

Luce had a habit of taking a defensive posture like this when others
spoke to her. Even if the other person was a professor.

Professor Fernando, who was in charge of grading the Magic Department’s
first-year performance evaluations and exams, had to be familiar with
Luce’s personality. Maybe that’s why he only slightly narrowed his eyes
and didn’t react.

“I’m leaving. See you later, Isaac.”

***That’s why you have no friends, you idiot.***

Of course, I didn’t say that and just waved my hand and sent her off.
Because I was scared.

The owner of the seat where Luce had sat at finally got his seat back
and let out a sigh of relief.

He looked like he was going to argue with me, but then he went as quiet
as a dead mouse. He must have realized that touching me would mean
touching Luce.

Afterwards.

Professor Fernando cleared his throat with a ‘Hmmmm” and began to speak
in earnest.

“Before we start the lecture, I’d like to announce the next performance
evaluation.”

It was the last performance evaluation before the end of the semester.

“We are going to evaluate your magic craft skills. As I had mentioned in
our last lecture, magic crafting boasts a very high efficiency as a way
to train mana control.”

The act of using mana to create crafting items was known as magic
crafting.

Although it was referred to as craftsmanship, it was more of an art that
sought ‘fleeting beauty’ rather than practical utility as a commodity.
The level of difficulty varied greatly depending on the design, and it
was primarily used in places such as performances.

In addition, mana efficiency and control were greatly involved in
shaping elemental mana into its desired form. Together, these two
abilities were known as mana mastery.

By the way, the higher the magic efficiency, the less mana was required
in order to cast a spell.

As mana control ability increased, it became possible for one to more
intricately shape the form of magic according to one’s will. That meant
I could make the shoddy ice ladder I built to flee from Charles Hall
look a lot better.

In addition, it had the advantage of speeding up the casting speed of
magic. In my case, it should be possible to shorten the preparation time
required to activate \[Frost Explosion\].

‘In the game, it was just a dialogue, but here it’s real.’

Well, I could think of it as part of my training.

“The theme is ‘Elemental Flower’. If you have an ice or rock element, it
will be a level 3 challenge. For other elemental types, it will be a
level 2 challenge.”

It was only natural.

For the ice or rock elements, once the elemental flower was created,
there was nothing left to do beyond the final carving.

For elements such as fire, water, lightning, and wind, it was necessary
to continuously maintain the form of the elemental flower, requiring a
higher level of mana mastery.

“For example, refer to the textbook. It would be more effective to
practice elemental flowers in pairs, with two people helping one
another. The performance evaluation will be in three days, and it will
be during this time. Practice thoroughly. That’s all. Let’s start the
lecture.”

When one student asked, “Professor, what if I don’t have friends?!”
Professor Fernando gave a cold response, “Then do it on your own.”

I was still inexperienced in using magic. It might be a good opportunity
to focus on developing my mana mastery for three days.

✦✧✦✧

“Is the lecture over?”

As soon as class was over, Luce greeted me at the doorway of the
classroom as if she had been waiting.

A shiver ran down my spine for a moment, but I took a deep breath and
tried to keep my composure.

To my knowledge, this was the first time Luce had ever made a friend.
She had always lived with her heart closed off to others, so she didn’t
know how to gauge emotional distance, which was why she was clinging to
me to the point of it being burdensome. Her lack of common sense also
contributed to this.

‘Really, what should I do?’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Luce didn’t make any friends at all. The
only reason she even slightly broke out of her loner status was due to
her romance with the protagonist.

Therefore, being friends with Luce was an area where my knowledge of
games didn’t apply. As I said before, I naturally assumed that it would
be a casual friendship like Amy and Mateo’s gang, but that was a
mistake.

I let out a sigh.

In the end, I left school with Luce.

While walking around the academy grounds, the Magic Department students’
attention was drawn to me; their eyes filled with envy, resentment, and
doubt were directed at me in unison.

It was only natural, no matter how many times I said it. Luce was the
top seat of the Magic Department’s first year, and an official heroine
in the game, and she ranked in the top five for her beauty in the whole
academy, and yet she was showing me a smile she had never shown anyone
else. Not to mention the fact that she was following me around.

***These kids are really causing my heart to be in bittersweet agony…***

Under normal circumstances, I would’ve felt smug, but considering my
position, I just felt helpless.

‘What the hell.’

It wasn’t that I hated Luce, but I couldn’t have her sticking to me like
a piece of chewing gum.

“Luce, I have somewhere to go…”

“Can’t you stay with me a little longer?”

Luce kept her head down, as if she knew what I was going to say.

“I know you have to train, but even for a little bit, I’ve had a lot of
fun today…”

***Oh, don’t stimulate my emotions. It’s heartbreaking.***

Judging by Luce’s reaction, parting ways from her right now might have
the opposite effect.

Her feelings of wanting to hang out with her friend would fuel her,
meaning, tomorrow could be even worse than today. And if she follows her
feelings and kidnaps and imprisons the protagonist, it’s *Extra Bad End
N.13.*

This was an urgent mission. I needed to reduce the time I spend with
Luce. Just to the level of my current friends.

So, today, I’d better honor Luce’s wishes and spend some more time
together and then have a serious talk.

I just so happened to have the perfect excuse; something that would
benefit me, and something that would appeal to Luce’s desire to spend
more time with me.

“I’m going to practice my elemental flower crafting from now on. Doesn’t
Class A have the same topic for the performance evaluation?”

“Yeah, do you want me to help you?”

Her first response was not *“Do you want to do it together?”* but *“Do
you want me to help you?”*. For Luce, it seemed like crafting elemental
flowers was a piece of cake.

Anyway, if someone with excellent mana control like Luce helped me, I’d
be more than happy.

“I’ll be in your care then.”

A gentle smile spread across Luce’s face.

Luce and I returned to Orphin Hall and found an empty classroom.

The door to the small classroom was open. We went inside and sat across
from each other at a single table. I took off my coat and hung it on the
back of the walnut chair next to me.

Evening. The sunset’s light was seeping through the windows into the
classroom. However, it was not yet the time to light a luminous lamp.

“First of all, the elemental flower asked of me is a level 3 challenge,
right? And since you are a water element user, it’s level 2 for you.”

“Isaac, do you know how to do it?”

“I can manage up to level 2, but level 3 feels a little daunting.”

I took out the textbook and flipped to the magic craft section to look
at an example of the level 3 elemental flower.

It had a picture of a hydrangea model, and it looked quite intimidating.

“Let’s start by warming up.”

I rolled up my shirt sleeves and began to channel mana with both hands
on the desk to create ice crafts.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

Firstly, I started with an easy-to-make model of a baby hippo and a
cannon.

“What is this? It looks cute.”

“It’s a baby hippo. Whoever touches it is fucked.”

“Oh, so there’s such a thing… Then what about this? I’ve never seen
one.”

“Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.”

“I don’t know what it is, but it looks highly complete.”

***Okay, I can do this.***

Next, I managed to pull off level 1. A simple elemental flower with a
few petals, and a slightly more difficult level 2 elemental flower. Luce
quietly clapped her hands and exclaimed, “Wow, great job.”

Excited, I went on to challenge level 3, the ice hydrangea.

“I’ll try too,” said Luce as she began to create her own elemental
flower by channeling water mana from her seat.

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1)」

My head was about to explode trying to pay attention to the design of
each petal. It was incredibly difficult to control mana in such a
delicate way.

In the end, what I made was just a block of ice that looked like granite
with holes here and there. Level 3 was just too much for me…

On the other hand, what emerged on Luce’s side was a very sophisticated
and detailed hydrangea model. The water element maintained the shape of
a hydrangea, boasting an incredibly fast and complex flow of water. It
was as if a new law of physics had been established within that flower.

“…….”

“…….”

With the best and worst results in front of us, Luce and I fell silent.

“P-Pretty good.”

It was my praise that broke the silence first. It was truly astonishing
perfection…

It did, however, bruise my pride a bit.

If I could get help from Luce, who was this good, I could improve my
magic crafting skills much faster than if I did it by myself.

“I’ll help you, Isaac.”

“Thanks… huh?”

Suddenly, Luce put her hands on the backs of mine.

I was startled by the sudden physical contact, but I quickly composed
myself as Luce started pouring out mana to create a mold made of water.
I began pouring my ice mana into the mold.

“Don’t elementalize your mana; instead, let it flow freely for the time
being. And remember this sensation.”

Luce’s intimate tone tickled my eardrums.

Her pale, slender hands were soft and warm to the touch. Her water mana
flowed gently through the back of my hand.

The light blue ice mana that had yet to be elementalized was becoming an
elaborate hydrangea. My mana was fitting into the mold that Luce had
created with her water mana.

It was similar to pouring a drink into a specific mold and freezing it
to form a popsicle.

Even the water that Luce created was flowing so fast, that I couldn’t
see any signs of it freezing under the influence of my ice mana.

‘Wow, amazing.’

How can something so difficult become so easy? A hydrangea model so
elaborate that it was hard to believe it was made with my mana was about
to be completed…

“I’m going to release it now.”

“Not yet!”

“Aah!”

When Luce suddenly tried to release her own mana, I hurriedly stopped
her. The reason why I hadn’t turned my mana into ice yet was because I
wanted to create a higher quality ice hydrangea.

Luce, on the other hand, had already removed the flower mold before I
could even say anything.

But as soon as she heard my voice, she tried to re-elementalize the mana
that had been released, but it was too late.

In the end, my mana, which wasn’t in an elemental state yet, and Luce’s
mana clashed and caused an elemental reaction.

The mana force field was to blame. It was the force that repels mana
away from one another. It happens when mana that hasn’t yet been
elementalized collides; a phenomenon that only appears between the mana
of living beings.

That was why I couldn’t use the trick of activating \[Ice Generation\]
inside the enemy’s body.

Eventually, the unstable water element and my ice mana spread like a
watering can in all directions.

*Chaaaaahhhh-*

The light blue ice mana scattered in the air, while the water made of
Luce’s mana splattered all over our bodies.

Before we knew it, we were like mice soaked in water.

Water dripped, drop by drop, from my damp hair. Luce glared at me, her
face dripping with water.

The silence lasted for a while as we stared into each other’s eyes,
when…

“Puhahaha.”

…Luce burst out laughing.

“Ahahahahahaha! Hahahahaha!”

***…What are you laughing at, girl?***

Luce laughed, even as she wiped the tears from her eyes. It was like
watching a gag that suited your taste on a comedy show, and you start
laughing out loud.

To be honest, I found the whole situation hilarious as well.

The more I thought about it, the funnier it became, and the more I
started laughing out loud. It was probably influenced by Luce’s
laughter.

“Oh, that’s so funny…! My stomach hurts…”

Come to think of it, it was the first time I had ever seen Luce burst
into laughter so happily. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, she always wore
a stoic face, only occasionally displaying a gentle smile.

It was a strange feeling.

“…I got hit right in the face.”

“Hahahaha!”

When I said something ridiculous, Luce burst out laughing again.

I burst out laughing as well, and we both happily laughed for a while.

“Oh, I’ll wipe it off you.”

Soon after, Luce took out her handkerchief from the school uniform
jacket hanging on the chair next to her and stood up, she leaned towards
me with her upper body resting on the desk.

“You could just ‘evaporate’, you know.”

“You can’t get rid of water magic that has seeped into your clothes.”

Luce responded while wiping my face with her handkerchief.

‘Evaporate’ was similar to my Defrost. It was to undo one’s own water
magic.

Come to think of it, even in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, after using
water magic and evaporate, the wet clothes did not dry. It was the same
when they got dirt on their clothes. They could only get rid of the
stagnant water.

As I thought about it, I raised my eyes and gasped for breath at the
ecstasy that spread across my vision.

Luce’s assertive chest was right in front of my nose.

Her black underwear peered through her water-soaked white shirt. My eyes
darted to the side, then back to the mesmerizing view, then back to the
side again.

“Where are you looking at?”

“…!”

Like a scene from a thriller, my heart sank.

I lifted my head in remorse and saw Luce’s face peering down at me.

Her face lit up with amusement, her cheeks flushing with a rosy hue. A
mischievous grin spread across her youthful face, damp with sweat, as it
glistened in the warm glow of the sunset.

“Isaac, you pervert.”

Luce’s intimate voice tickled my ears like a feather.

That brief moment felt like an eternity to me.

Chapter 36: - Shield
====================

༺ **Shield**༻

The colorful leaves were turning dark green with the passage of time,
and the warm season was just around the corner.

Due of the mildly warm weather, students had begun to take off their
school uniform jackets. I was no different.

Yesterday was the performance evaluation for the Elemental Flower Craft.
Although not perfect, I was able to achieve a satisfactory result. It
was all thanks to Luce helping me every time I practiced.

We had decided how we would spend our time together. Even if we did
choose to meet, it would be in private with just the two of us. As a
justification, I reiterated that *‘I stand out too much when I’m with
Luce.’*

She appeared to have enjoyed our friendship so much that she couldn’t
help but regret it. It seemed that she expected a daily routine of going
to and from school together, eating together, and hanging out together,
regardless of what others thought.

What could I do? I wasn’t in a position to do that.

And, as expected, rumors were already spreading that there was an
unusual atmosphere between Luce and I. Well, it was already spilled
water. There was nothing I could do about it now.

Sooner or later, I’ll have to pretend to be as incompetent as possible
so that they’ll stop paying attention to me and think, ‘Ah, Isaac’s a
hopeless bastard, and the top seat has gone off the deep end!”

If Alice Carrol ever heard about the rumor regarding the two of us, I
could only hope that she would think it wasn’t a big deal and move on.

“Hey! I am going to be the test proctor for the end-of-semester
evaluation for this freshman year!”

I was in a corner of the butterfly garden at noon with the sky shining
brightly.

It was the weekend. Today, I planned to spend twice as much time
practicing magic than I usually did. This was because I took up quite a
bit of time practicing magic craft.

Even today, Dorothy Heartnova sat with her back against a nearby zelkova
tree and interrupted my training with her chatter. But this time, her
chatter was worth listening to. It was a story that had a lot to do with
the scenario.

“Aren’t you a senior? Wouldn’t you normally hate that kind of trouble in
the first place?”

“Nyahaha, of course! But\~ Because this elder sister wants to see if our
president will do well in his exam\~. Aren’t you so honored as a fan of
mine?!”

“Ah yes. It is an honor.”

“That reaction is boring…”

Dorothy pouted her lips and grumbled.

Originally, being a test proctor was not a position that students could
be entrusted with. However, the academy’s administration has been
plagued by the appearance of demons recently.

In the end, it was decided that the strongest students within the
academy would be chosen as test proctors.

One of these candidates was Dorothy Hartnova. It was the same as the
original scenario of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Without Dorothy, the Thunderbird Subjugation itself would be impossible.
Because without her, the odds were stacked against the academy.

“I even got rid of the student council president…”

My head twitched.

Alice Carroll volunteered as a test proctor?

“The student council president?”

“Yeah, because she said she wanted to do it too. So we made a bet and I
won.”

It was different from the scenario I knew. It was clear that she had
taken it upon herself to find out who was going around fighting the
demons.

I asked Dorothy what kind of bet it was, and she answered that it was a
violent one. I didn’t ask any further questions.

“Thank goodness…”

In the end, it was a great relief that Alice Carroll, the student
council president, didn’t become the test proctor.

I let out a sigh of relief and muttered to myself, but Dorothy’s ears
perked up as she wrapped herself in starlight mana, and flew towards me.

“Do you like me being that?”

Ah, I was just talking to myself.

As usual, Dorothy stuck her head out to me and asked me with a lively
smile.

I nodded. I didn’t want to disappoint her, even if it was just a
misunderstanding.

“Yes. I’m a fan of yours, senior, so no doubt.”

I really was glad that she became the test proctor. That thought was
sincere, without a hint of doubt. Thanks to that, the scenario didn’t go
awry.

Dorothy let out her signature “Nihihi” laughter and brightened up with a
smile as bright as the sun.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱「Act 3, Chapter 3, End of Semester
Evaluation」 leads directly to 「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird
Subjugation」.

At that time, Luce’s 8-star familiar, ‘Thunderbird Galia’, became a
demon.

Dorothy, who played the role of a test proctor, would be a key player in
the Thunderbird Subjugation along with the main character, Ian
Fairytale.

Originally, in a one-on-one fight, Dorothy was strong enough to defeat
the Thunderbird. However, the battle would have been fierce enough that
the entire surrounding land would vanish.

Since Dorothy had to fight while protecting people, she couldn’t rush
into a full-on fight with all her strength. If she did, they would all
die.

This was where the protagonist Ian came into play, as he could deliver
the killing blow with his light element, which was the demon’s weakness.

“Hmm, do you like me, President?”

Suddenly, Dorothy opened her mischievous eyes and asked with a sinister
laugh.

***That expression seems a bit ambiguous…?***

“Oh my. I wonder if our cute junior has heard this embarrassing talk?”

Dorothy flashed me a mischievous grin and tilted her head towards the
schoolgirl that stood at a distance from me.

Rose-gold hair cascaded down around her face, and the sides of her head
were adorned with morpho butterfly-colored braids. She was my classmate
and one of the official heroines, Luce Eltania.

She had her arms crossed with an expressionless face as her eyes were
locked with Dorothy’s.

“…….”

Luce exuded an oppressive aura of unspoken pressure as if warning me not
to speak, a pressure that enveloped my entire body and struck fear into
my heart.

‘Ugh, chills…’

Even someone as bright as Dorothy was not immune to Luce’s antisocial
persona.

“It’s not like it’s anything to be embarrassed about.”

By the way, Dorothy didn’t even like me, but today, she was using a lot
of ambiguous expressions as if she were secretly flirting. Of course, I
didn’t hate it.

My favorite character, Dorothy, felt like a lovely daughter. Of course,
I have never been married, let alone had a daughter, but that was the
general feeling.

Dorothy covered her mouth with her right hand and flashed a sly smile.

“Didn’t the President say he likes me? Isn’t that kind of embarrassing?”

“I said that I like that senior became the test proctor, didn’t I? No
matter how I look at it, that’s the context, isn’t it?”

“What a nice boy\~ You’re so embarrassed. How cute\~. Nihihi!”

Dorothy, being shorter than me, stretched out her right arm and stroked
my hair.

First of all, thank you for the fan service.

Afterward, Dorothy hummed a tune as she returned to the zelkova tree.
She then leaned back against the tree, pulled out an unknown book from
the witch’s hat on her head, and began to read.

I straightened the hair that Dorothy had stroked. There was a lot of
physical contact these days…

Dorothy was not an official heroine in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, and
she was an opponent whose mind I couldn’t read with \[Psychological
Insight\].

Even though she was my favourite character, it was difficult to tell if
her behavioral pattern changes were accidental or if there was a cause.
I didn’t have enough information to make an informed decision.

“Isaac, let’s get started,” said Luce in a soothing voice. I turned my
head towards her.

Her expression, which had been ice-cold when facing Dorothy, softened to
a gentle smile when she saw me. It truly was a dramatic change of
expression.

“Uh, please take good care of me.”

\[Come on, rock! This Bello will deal with you!\]

\[Kyuu?\]

Besides Luce, the little killer whale magic beast, Bello, was busily
swimming through the air with water mana wrapped around her body.

Next to me, Eden, the small golem magic beast, tilted his head and
pretended to be cute.

Luce said she would help me with my training over the weekend, and here
she was. I readily agreed because we were out of sight and Dorothy was
not a threat.

Luce had an excited expression on her face at that time, and her cheeks
were flushed enough to make me blush. I should have been happy, but she
seemed to be the one who was most excited.

Of course, as soon as she saw Dorothy, she reflexively raised her guard.

Dorothy was briefly offended by Luce, who was cold to her, but seemed to
understand as a senior and took a step back.

“Eden, prepare for battle.”

\[Kyuuu!\]

Luce was the top student of the first year at the Magic Department.
Among the freshmen, there was no one stronger than her. Even though she
was using over half of her original power to suppress the Thunderbird.

She extended her right hand towards me. Then, a blue magic circle
appeared in front of her hand and slowly began to rotate.

I could feel a dense mana that made my whole body shudder. Motivation
surged through me.

I conjured up cold ice flames – \[Frostfire\] – in each hand and faced
Luce.

From now on, I would engage in a duel with her. I would cast magic at
her, block or dodge her magic, and so on.

Dueling with her would be of great help to me in the mastery of magic
warfare.

Soon, Luce and I began to battle each other with magic.

“Ugh!”

…It was more like a one-sided assault.

✦✧✦✧

‘I guess I was right after all.’

Near the butterfly garden. On a certain hillside.

Eva Heilov, a glasses-wearing schoolgirl, was hiding behind a tree,
secretly watching Isaac and his group.

She was a student at the bottom of Class D of the Magic Department, but
had a talent that other students of the Magic Department did not have.

It was her \[Stealth\] magic that allowed her to conceal her own
presence. In the eyes of others, her translucent body was
indistinguishable from the surrounding landscape.

‘Is there something special about you, Isaac?’

A male student with silver-blue hair. She recognized him because they
were in the same Class D.

His name was Isaac. He was the one who surprised the students by using
5-star magic during the dueling evaluation, despite having the lowest
Grade-E when he measured his mana at the start of the semester.

It was an amazing sight, but it was quickly forgotten.

Even if a Grade-E wizard consistently polished his skills and achieved
tremendous growth in a short period of time, he only succeeded in
mastering 5-star magic at an immature level.

In front of those who were already capable of using 5-star magic at a
high level, it would only look like that.

Then there was the light element, indisputable in terms of rarity, which
had appeared. As a result, Isaac’s single use of five-star magic was
hardly enough to make him stand out.

‘Four Constellations’. A student faction that could be involved in the
administration of Märchen Academy.

Eva Heilov was one of them, an intelligence gatherer chosen to represent
the ‘Red Elephant’ seat.

The Four Constellations could each recruit 10 first-year students as
members starting from the second semester, so they secretly competed to
recruit talent and collect information from the first semester.

So, the Four Constellations secretly approached students who had
abilities that seemed to be useful for information gathering but were
below the middle of the pack and could never even imagine of joining a
Constellation.

They would whisper sweet proposals such as “Gather some useful
information. If you perform well, we will let you into our
Constellation.”

Just being affiliated with one of the Four Constellations was
attractive, even outside of the Academy, so most people, whether they
were interested in the power within the Academy or not, accepted the
offer.

Eva Heilov was one such recipient of the offer.

‘The top seat ice princess, cold to everyone, friendly to only one
person… and that’s you.’

A few days ago, Eva had overheard a rumor that Luce Eltania, the number
one target for recruitment, showed a particularly cheerful side only to
Isaac.

So she started keeping a close eye on Isaac, and the harvest had
exceeded her expectations.

“Don’t overdo it. Whenever I see our President in pain, this elder
sister’s heart aches.”

“Oh, thank you for your kind words.”

Märchen Academy’s Strongest. A genius who seems to have received Lord
Manhalla’s Blessing. The 2nd Year’s Top Seat. The Star Witch.

Dorothy Heartnova, the sophomore girl who had been called all of those,
was wiping Isaac’s face with her own handkerchief.

‘Besides, he’s even involved with the famous senior Dorothy…’

Dorothy didn’t belong to any of the Constellations. Naturally, the Four
Constellations had tried their best to recruit her, but she had flatly
refused every offer, saying she wasn’t interested. She was
self-assertive, self-centered, and lived in her own world.

To think that such a monster was staying with Isaac… It was amazing.

It was clear that Luce and Dorothy had favorable feelings for Isaac. It
was unclear whether it was a crush between the opposite sex or a
friendship between friends, but either way, the fact that two monsters
from the Magic Department were hanging out around Isaac was important
information.

“What is it about Isaac that makes him so special to those two…?”

Eva monologued to herself in a low voice.

Isaac seemed to have something special enough to attract those two, but
what the hell was it…

“I’ll have to report to the right people and talk to the seniors first…”

It was then.

Dorothy, who had been wiping Isaac’s face, turned her gaze to Eva.

“……!!”

In an instant, shivers ran down Eva’s spine.

She was in \[Stealth\] mode and this magic consumed very little mana.
Even Eva’s measly Grade D+ mana was very small. In other words, there
was no way she could be detected at this distance!

*…No, I overlooked it.* Dorothy was a monster among monsters. It was
highly likely that her mana perception transcended common sense.

Eva quickly ducked behind a tree and leaned back. Her breathing
quickened. She was terrified.

She was an inferior Class D student with nothing to show for it other
than \[Stealth\], a commoner whose last name was her hometown name. If
she was caught spying on Isaac, she wasn’t sure what she could do,
especially against those monsters.

“Haa, haa, whew….”

After a while, Eva took a deep breath and calmed herself down.

She poked her head to the side of the tree and looked back at Isaac.
Isaac and Luce were clashing spells again, while Dorothy leaned back
against a zelkova tree, watching their duel (one-sided assault).

‘Was it because of my mood…’

Just then, as she breathed a sigh of relief, a white cat with a pink
ribbon on its tail approached Eva. An imprint of its owner on its back.
It was a familiar.

\[Hello there, friend.\]

The white cat greeted her with the voice of a mature lady. She greeted
Eva so casually, that Eva forgot that she was in \[Stealth\] for a
moment.

\[Why are you spying on my Dorothy?\]

Eva’s face turned pale.

Because she realized that the white cat, ‘Ella’, was Dorothy’s familiar.

\[No, it was… Isaac…\]

Eva’s shoulders trembled. Ella’s sharp eyes did not miss that response.

\[Where are you from? Black Tiger? Blue Wolf? Golden Eagle? Red
Elephant?\]

“Uh, well, that’s…”

\[The Four Constellations have certainly been annoying recently. Why do
they keep doing the same things?\]

“Huh…?”

Eva asked in confusion, but she understood exactly what Ella meant by
that.

There were other students who had heard the rumors and followed Isaac.
It was obvious that they were in the same position as her.

\[Then, Dorothy’s message.\]

*Charararara──*

A sudden cluster of colorful stars appeared in the air. The starlight
spell that Dorothy had implanted in Ella was activated.

\[I know your purpose. It’s irritating, so can you stop being such a
nuisance?\]

The starlight magic surrounded Eva on all sides, leaving her with
nowhere to escape to.

“Eek…!”

Fear engulfed Eva like a tidal wave, causing her whole body to tremble
violently. Dorothy’s magic seemed to weigh heavily on her.

Before long, Ella chuckled and withdrew Dorothy’s starlight magic.

\[Keep what you’ve learned between us if possible. Otherwise, who knows
what Dorothy might do. She might even completely get rid of the Four
Constellations, depending on her mood. ‘Because of you’.\]

In the first place, there was no one who could stop Dorothy Heartnova at
Märchen Academy.

Her presence at the academy could only be described as the equivalent of
a large-scale natural disaster, simply playing around with students.

Eva released her \[Stealth\], which no longer meant anything, and nodded
her head hastily with a frightened face.

“Yes, yesss…!”

Her sobbing voice cracked. Eva bowed her upper body to Ella, and quickly
ran away from the area.

‘S-Scary!’

Eva sniffled and disappeared from Ella’s sight.

Ella breathed out a deep sigh. This was already the 4th time she had
driven out the stalkers under Dorothy’s orders.

\[My Dorothy is finally starting to show some interest in a boy, but why
is it that they can’t leave her alone…\]

***Don’t disturb my Dorothy’s pure love.***

For the record, Dorothy never said that she had a crush on Isaac. More
accurately, she said she was ‘curious’.

Well, curiosity was a very good emotion for love to sprout.

Ella was like a mother rooting for her daughter to find a good man and
live a happy life.

…In the first place, just watching people fall in love was fun.

Dorothy said that a friend with a crush on Isaac had arrived today, she
seemed excited at the thought of teasing the girl with rose gold hair.

She wasn’t sure of Dorothy’s true feelings, but if she had any affection
towards Isaac at all…

Ella hoped that her master wouldn’t regret him being stolen away.

\[But what is there to see in that child… I don’t think there’s anything
special about it other than being cute. Even made me eat firecrackers
for him.\]

*Fuaaa!*

“Ugh!”

\[Kyuuuuuu!\]

The sight of Isaac and his golem familiar Eden being swept away by
Luce’s water magic was reflected in Ella’s eyes.

Ella furrowed one eyebrow.

\[Ooh, that must have hurt…\]

But Isaac scrambled to his feet and fought back against Luce.

“Eden, get up, let’s go!”

\[Kyuu… uu!\]

“Ugghhh!”

\[Kyuuuu!\]

Ella sat there and watched the duel (one-sided assault) between Isaac
and Luce.

Still… the man’s willpower was admirable.

Chapter 37: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (1)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (1)**༻

“It’s almost time for the end-of-semester evaluation.”

Inside Class A’s classroom in Orphin Hall. The top five students who
arrived for class that morning were seated far apart from one another.
It was an overwhelmingly large space for the number of students present.

They were looking at Philip Meltron, a middle-aged professor with red
hair, standing in front of the podium.

With his hands behind his back, he made his announcement in a gentle
tone.

“The end-of-semester evaluation consists of two parts: a written test
and a practical test. The written test will be held for five days, nine
hours a day, and the practical exams will be held on the grounds of the
Old Academy for five hours. You are the elite of the elite, nobles among
nobles, and I trust you will all achieve excellent grades in the end.”

‘Nobles among nobles’. Professor Philip, who was notorious among his
students as discriminatory, frequently used this phrase to describe his
Class-A students.

Of course, for the five Class A female students, it was a compliment
with little meaning.

Lisetta Lionheart, a female student who wore a male school uniform with
her shirt unbuttoned.

Keridna Whiteclark, who always wore a sinister smile for no apparent
reason.

Ciel Carnedas, who was always dozing off.

Kaya Astrean, with her sparkling eyes and soldierly demeanor.

And Luce Eltania, the pinnacle of the first years, and indifferent to
everyone.

Professor Philip was pleased with his Class A, which was made up of all
the best and brightest students, and none of the commoners that he
disliked.

“Ciel Carnedas, will you be dozing off like that during the
end-of-semester evaluations?”

Ciel Carnedas, a beautiful girl with short, wavy blue hair, shook her
head and struggled to keep her eyes open.

It wasn’t the first time she’d dozed off in class, and it certainly
wouldn’t be the last. This was an insincere attitude that would reduce
her attitude score, but Philip, who was intolerant of commoners and
generous to nobles, tended to let it slide every time as if there were
no problems.

The words he’d spoken earlier had been half in jest.

Ciel wiped the drool from her face with her sleeve, then rubbed her
helplessly open eyes and looked at Philip.

“Maybe…”

Excluding Luce, who was not interested in others, the other three
students looked at her in disbelief.

Philip just let out a friendly smile.

“Well, let’s start class then.”

Professor Phillip was now used to Class-A, which was filled with
weirdos.

✦✧✦✧

“I will now explain the rules of the ‘Fell Card Competition,’ the
practical exam for the end-of-semester evaluation.”

Finally, the「Act 3, Chapter 3, End of Semester Evaluation」 part of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ had begun.

Up until last week, I had to take the written exam for a total of 5
days, 9 hours each day. It was so hard to actually do something that was
easily skipped in the game.

In particular, the subjects were especially stressful: ‘Introduction to
Basic Magic’, ‘Study of Basic Elements’, ‘Ecology of Magic Beasts’,
‘Study of Magic Tools’, ‘Analysis of Magic Circles’, etc…… Since I came
from a liberal arts background, I felt like I was dying while trying to
solve calculation problems.

I could only study so much on top of my training, so I was unable to
fully grasp all the materials before I took the exam.

But I gave it my best shot, so I expect to get a decent grade.

This was the site of the old Märchen Academy. It used to be a
functioning school, but was now closed.

The first-year students of the Magic Department, including myself, stood
in the site in an orderly fashion. Closed buildings with beautiful
exteriors were nearby, as were gardens overgrown with weeds due to
neglect.

On the stage in front of the students, Professor Fernando was speaking
with a megaphone. Behind him stood the professors and exam proctors.

“The rules are simple. If you collect 5 of these ‘Fell Cards’ and bring
them to the designated location for submission, you pass the exam.”

Professor Fernando levitated a card with telekinesis magic and showed it
to the students. It was a sophisticated card with a symbol representing
a grimoire and a wizard.

“The Fell Cards are hidden throughout the sprawling grounds of the old
academy. They will be difficult to find, as they emit only the faintest
trace of mana.”

The radius of the old Märchen Academy grounds was unknown, but it should
be considered comparable to Yeouido in Korea. Anyways, it was rather
spacious.

“The submission location will be revealed once you have collected 5 Fell
Cards. It will be assigned at random, so don’t be surprised if you
happen to discover the location by chance. By the way, it is possible to
steal Fell Cards. If you knock out a student with a Fell Card, it will
be transferred to you. It is enchanted with telekinesis magic.”

The students started whispering.

*‘I can’t fight, what should I do?’ ‘Isn’t this just another survival
rule?’* These conversations were ongoing. It was exactly the same
repertoire as during the class placement evaluation.

Meanwhile, I caught sight of the test proctor, Dorothy Heartnova, who
was standing behind Professor Fernando.

She tilted her head and waved her hand at me, her smile as bright as the
sun. The star and moon earrings on her earlobes glistened in the
sunlight.

‘My favorite is too cute\~’

I waved back and greeted her while trying to hold back my dad-like
laughter.

But for some reason, the cheeky boys around me saw Dorothy’s smile and
blushed. ***I’m sorry, but that greeting is mine, kids.***

“And the biggest part of this semester’s end-of-semester evaluation is.”

Professor Fernando extended his index finger upward. The students
followed his gesture and looked up at the sky.

“It means that the information from 1st to 5th place will be disclosed
in real-time.”

A large amount of mana grains that looked like sand were engraved in the
crystal clear sky. There were two large squares, and inside each square,
there were five vertical lines of ‘-‘ inscriptions. It was enormous.

Fell

–

–

–

–

–

Eliminations

–

–

–

–

–

“The left column shows who has the most Fell Cards, while the right
column shows who has eliminated the most students.”

It was a live broadcast of those who ranked 1st through 5th in terms of
card count and kill count, respectively.

“Now, take a look at the bracelets we handed out.”

The students looked down at the bracelets handed out by the academy’s
administrators as per Professor Fernando’s instructions. They were all
wearing one on their wrist.

Each bracelet had a button with the words “Fell” and “Eliminations” on
it.

“The bracelet cannot be removed until the end-of-semester evaluation is
over. As long as it’s on, your location will be relayed to us in
real-time.”

This bracelet was like a GPS with magical powers.

If you pass the end-of-semester evaluation, it will unlock itself on its
own.

“And you can use it to check where the students ranked from 1st to 5th
are. Take their Fell Cards or run away, it’s up to you. Whatever choice
you make will be reflected in the evaluation, so act carefully.”

In other words, this was a survival game, a game of wits, and a game of
control.

It was a method to evaluate overall mana perception, combat ability,
tactical ability, and problem-solving skills as a wizard.

“The time limit is 5 hours. Collect 5 Fell Cards within that time, and
arrive at the designated location for submission. At that time, you can
take off the bracelet and go home. Even if you bring more than 5 Fell
Cards, there will be no bonus points, so don’t do anything unnecessary.”

“Professor, what happens if I fail the exam?”

When a male student raised his hand and asked, Fernando explained with
his usual icy face.

“If a student becomes incapacitated or fails to pass the exam within the
time limit… they will have to take compulsory supplementary classes
later today.”

“Huhhhh?!”

The students were taken aback, but they quickly calmed down when
Professor Fernando casually extended his hand. “This is a penalty. I
won’t even unlock your bracelets in case you try to run away,” he said,
as if he didn’t care about their complaints.

Students either reacted with fright or disgust.

“Finally, today marks the end of your first semester. May you reap the
fruits of your labor. That’s all there is to it.”

When Professor Fernando was done, the facilitator next to him directed
everyone to board the carriage.

As the students began to grumble and leave, I started to walk away.

Suddenly, Dorothy turned to me, cupped her hands around her mouth, and
mouthed the word, “Good luck.” ^1^화이팅, literally ‘Fighting’- used in
Korean to cheer on someone and to wish someone good luck. It is used to
express encouragement and to show support for a person’s actions. Then
she stretched her right arm upward and gave me a silent wave.

***Aww, she’s so cute. I’m gonna die.***

A group of small carriages that had been modified to resemble minicars
waited behind the site. You could hop in any of them, and they would
take you to a designated location.

I chose a carriage and decided to organize my thoughts as we rode to the
designated location.

The final part of the first semester of the first year – the
*End-of-Semester Evaluation* and the *Thunderbird Subjugation*. I had
already planned everything.

During the end-of-semester evaluation, around the time Luce passed the
exam and nightfall was approaching, the demon, ‘Vera the Summoner’,
appeared to steal Luce’s familiar.

It wouldn’t be unreasonable to consider her one of the strongest in the
world of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, particularly when it came to
controlling familiars, as she possessed an extreme level of dominance
over them.

That demon forcibly summoned Luce’s familiar, Thunderbird Galia, and
placed the familiar under her control.

The demon then goes to the examination center and tries to kill the main
character, Ian Fairytale, but was later foiled by Dorothy’s
intervention.

When Dorothy was forced to retreat for the sake of the student’s safety,
the demon would unleash the barrier of the Thunderbird and enshroud the
site of the old Märchen Academy.

If I didn’t pass the end-of-semester evaluation before that, my plan to
*‘kill Vera the Summoner at the optimal time’* would be thrown out the
window.

‘In other words, my purpose…’

…was to pass the end-of-semester assessment as quickly as possible,
remove the bracelet, and set myself free.

It was to prepare for ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱’s 「Act 3, Chapter 4,
Thunderbird Subjugation」 part.

As a side note, there was no option to miss the exam. If I did not
attend the exam for reasons other than those specified in the Marx
Treaty, I would be automatically expelled.

“Phew, haa.”

I inhaled and exhaled to relieve the tension I felt.

Now, it was time to check my current status.

There had been no dramatic change in my stats from the day I defeated
Leafa the Illusive until now. \[Ice Sovereign\], which was always
active, was still unusable, so I’ve been suppressing it to the point
where it didn’t even have an effect.

Still, I did achieve a higher level of growth than I expected at the
beginning of the semester. It was thanks to defeating the Disaster Ant
Corp and Leafa the Illusive.

My current level was 57. I had recently gained 1 more level. My growth
rate was snail-like in comparison with the top students, but that was
the way Isaac was, so I couldn’t help it. I just had to deal with it.

For reference, I had invested the newly acquired 2 stat points in
\[Learning Efficiency\].

‘I’ve grown a lot from being the weakest in one semester…’

Of course, it still felt like there were more students in the first
grade who I couldn’t beat yet.

“We have arrived, students! Work hard!”

“Thank you.”

I bid the coachman farewell and got off the carriage. We arrived at
Seiran Hall, a four-story stone building surrounded by green foliage and
vines.

It was originally designed that way, but due to neglect, even the
windows were now overgrown with plants.

All I needed were five Fell Cards.

But as soon as I got the Fell Cards, my name would shoot to the top of
the rankings, and all the first-year students would know where I was.

After that, I’ll become everyone’s target. And I would undoubtedly be
attacked.

In other words, the main goal was to ‘survive’ until I collected 5 Fell
Cards and arrived at the submission location.

I needed to do it as quickly as possible, but what rank should I be?

I did some quick math and came to the conclusion that I should be able
to pass while ranking first or second. That’s a hell of a difficulty
level.

‘It’s a test I’ve played countless times in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.’

***It’ll be fine, it’ll be fine… Please work out as planned…***

To get rid of my worries, I warmed up my body by lightly stretching. And
soon.

*Pang*─*!*

In the center of the old Märchen Academy grounds, firecrackers loudly
exploded, signaling the start of the exam.

I swallowed my dry saliva and started running straight ahead, ignoring
Seiran Hall right behind me.

Chapter 38: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (2)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (2)**༻

‘Survival rules, it’s been a long time…’

Her light green pigtails fluttered in the early summer breeze.

Kaya Astrean, first year second seat of the Magic Department. She was
wandering around the grounds of the old Märchen Academy, holding a wand
while remaining alert.

The ‘Fell cards’ were supposed to be discovered via mana perception.
However, no matter how much she wandered around, she could only sense
natural mana without any abnormalities.

Furthermore, she couldn’t solely focus on mana perception in a situation
where she had to prepare for ambushes from other students.

During the class placement evaluation, the mana emitted from the mana
grains was easy to detect, so she had nothing to worry about, even while
she was on high alert.

But the end-of-semester evaluation was different. The mana emitted by
the Fell Cards was so difficult to detect that it was incomparable to
mana grains. However, if she only focused on detecting mana, it would be
difficult for her to stay alert, so she was in a pickle.

‘Will Sir Isaac do the same?’

***…No, he wouldn’t. Sir Isaac is an amazing person.***

Kaya cleared her mind and concentrated on her mana perception as well as
her alertness.

If she struggled in a place like this, she would never be able to catch
up with Isaac for the rest of her life. She hoped to one day be strong
enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the man she admired.

‘Focus, focus…!’

She hoped to breeze through this type of exam.

Suddenly, she heard a ‘Clink! Clink!’ sound coming from the sky. It was
the sound of small particles colliding against one another.

Kaya raised her head. She saw the scoreboard that Professor Fernando had
mentioned before. The mana grains engraved with telekinesis magic were
slowly changing their shape.

And then.

Fell

\[1st Place (Red) Mateo Jordana Fell Card +1\]

An unexpected name was listed on the scoreboard on the left. It was the
ranking of Fell Card holders.

‘Did he find one already? Even that man?’

This hurt her pride.

Come to think of it, didn’t they say that the locations of the students
ranked 1st to 5th could be located?

Kaya raised her left arm and examined the bracelet around her wrist.
Each bracelet was engraved with the words ‘Fell’ and ‘Eliminations’.

When she put her finger on the word ‘Fell’, the mana grains inside the
bracelet oozed out and formed a map on the bracelet. Someone had stored
magic with certain rules into the bracelet.

It was an awe-inspiring level of mana mastery. Professor Fernando was
also an excellent telekinetic wizard, but the capabilities of this
bracelet were far beyond his level.

There was only one person on this island who could use this level of
telekinesis magic.

‘The magic of the Hegel Tower Master.’

Aria Lilias, the Tower Master of the Hegel Magic Tower. This must be her
work.

The mana grains represented the grounds of the old Märchen Academy. Kaya
diligently studied the map.

Kaya’s location was indicated by a light green grain among the light
yellow mana grains.

In one location, she noticed a red mana grain slowly moving. It appeared
to be Mateo Jordana.

So, next to the ‘1st place’ marker, ‘Red’ was written, meaning Mateo was
being marked with a red mana grain.

‘Mateo Jordana is here… Come to think of it, I can’t seem to go to the
outskirts or Carly Hall. I guess the entirety of the old academy grounds
isn’t being used for the examination site.’

The iconic building of the old Märchen Academy was, of course, ‘Carly
Hall’.

At the far end of the old academy’s grounds, perched on top of a high
hill, was a palace-like building that overlooked the old academy
grounds.

They must have thought that the range would be too large if the building
and its outskirts were used as exam sites, seeing as it didn’t show up
on the map.

To be fair, the massive, transparent barrier that separated the exam
sites didn’t cover the entirety of the old academy grounds. Even with
the naked eye, it was clear that the outskirts and Carly Hall were
excluded from the exam site.

Well, this was just a simple reference.

Kaya touched the ‘Fell’ part of the bracelet once more. Then, the mana
grains flowed into the bracelet like sand.

“By the way, this…”

She got a rough idea when she thought about it.

“If you get a Fell card in the beginning, you’re at a huge
disadvantage.”

Fell cards must be hard to find. Kaya herself, who was confident in her
mana perception, felt the same way, and she could only imagine how the
other students felt.

Therefore, being at the top of the rankings made you a target for many
students.

In that case, the structure of this exam became clear.

The first half of the exam sets the stage for the top students. Of
course, even if the opponent was a top-ranked student, there would be
students who tried to attack them, but there wouldn’t be too many of
them. Since the victor was obvious.

And once the top students have passed their exams, those below them
would fight it out.

As time went by, the grounds of the old Märchen Academy would gradually
become a battlefield for the weaker students.

In other words.

If one entered the rankings in the early stages, they were bound to be
the target of many students, including the top-ranking students.

In the end, it was a mind game after all.

‘Especially for those who are average or weak, if they’re lucky enough
to make it into the top rankings early on…’

They would definitely be targeted, faster than anyone else.

In conclusion, one would need to carefully consider whether to defeat
Mateo and take his Fell Card or not. Even if they did defeat him and
took his Fell Card, their name would stand out on the list.

Kaya, no matter how strong she was, couldn’t win against a stronger
opponent. She needed to think carefully and act with caution.

“There’s a lot to consider…”

She was already preoccupied with mana perception while she stayed on
guard, but now she had to engage in this battle of wits as well.

Her head was about to explode.

Meanwhile, inside an abandoned store on the grounds of the old Märchen
Academy.

The students’ were mercilessly firing elemental magic at a man.

*Whirrr─!*

*Boom-!*

*Whiiiiiiir─!*

“Tsk…!”

The target was Mateo Jordana, a brown-haired man who had climbed to the
top of the rankings by being the only one with a Fell Card.

“Hah! It’s meaningless to resist in front of me!”

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

Tristan Humphrey, the conceited blond aristocrat, shouted from the
rooftop of the abandoned store, while he looked down at Mateo. The
surrounding area was dominated by Tristan’s wind.

The students Tristan had gathered while using his social status also
took their positions and were all aiming at Mateo. There were a total of
4 students from Class B to Class C.

5 to 1. Despite the disadvantageous situation, Mateo leisurely smiled.

“Aren’t you weaker than me, Tristan? You can’t do anything unless you
gang up on me.”

“Provocation won’t work, Mateo Jordana. My goal is not just you! It’s to
get the best ranking in this semester’s end-of-term assessment! To make
it clear to you and even the Grade E commoner how great I am!”

“Grade E commoner? Are you talking about Isaac?”

“Isn’t that obvious? Who else can be a Grade E commoner other than him?
Hah! He must be scrambling to survive right about now. *Heuheu,* just
thinking about it brings me joy!”

Mateo scratched his head with an uneasy expression. Tristan usually
talked like a thug or a third-rate villain, but now that he thought
about it, Tristan had never actually done anything cowardly to harm
others. Even to someone he despised like Isaac.

If someone pissed him off, he would say, ‘I’ll prove how great of a
being I am with my grades kekeke.’ And somehow, he always showed a
sincere image of himself, which wasn’t quite in character with a thug.

Maybe that was why Tristan was sorta likable.

“Is that so? Then, shall I surrender?”

There was a sense of playfulness in Mateo’s thick voice. With a slight
raise of his arms, he recreated a scene from the dueling evaluation,
which caused Tristan’s subordinates to laugh.

*-Snap.* A red vein appeared on Tristan’s forehead. The word ‘surrender’
was nothing more than an insult to his pride.

He still trembled just thinking about the dueling evaluation…!

“Oh, I’ll kill you! Mateo Jordanaaa!!”

Tristan screamed at the top of his lungs and stretched out his arm
towards Mateo, a light green magic circle appearing in front of him.

Tristan unleashed a powerful whirlwind at Mateo, and Mateo countered by
creating a thick wall of rock in front of himself.

「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」 「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Whiiiiiiiiii──!*

*Dddddddddddd!——!*

The \[Rock Wall\] remained steadfast even after being hit by Tristan’s
\[Whirlwind\].

“Tsk…!”

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

Tristan followed up with a sharp blade of wind, \[Wind Sword\], but the
result was the same. It was a stark contrast to when he had lightly
slashed through Isaac’s \[Ice Wall\] during the dueling evaluation.

Mateo’s defense was rock solid. Tristan suspected that even if he used
the most powerful magic spell available to him, Mateo’s defenses would
be impenetrable.

‘I’ll have to use an elemental reaction to break through…!’

Tristan glanced at his four men. If they could use \[Elemental
Synergy\], which increased their magic power by combining different
elements, it would be enough to break through Mateo’s defenses.

Meanwhile, as Mateo and Tristan’s group were having their showdown.

*Charak Charak───*

A new name began to appear on the scoreboard that was spread out in the
air.

Mateo and Tristan’s group looked up to confirm the name.

Eliminations

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +1\]

It wasn’t the scoreboard with Mateo’s name on it, but the ‘Eliminations’
scoreboard next to it, where students are ranked according to how many
they’ve eliminated.

The name of the first-year top seat of the Magic Department was engraved
on said scoreboard.

Top seat? Mateo was the only one who had a Fell Card right now, so why
did she ‘Kill’ someone?

Tristan was taken aback. The purpose of this exam was to collect ‘Fell
Cards’. Did the top seat eliminate another student for no reason?

Suddenly, a question popped into Tristan’s head.

‘Come to think of it, why is there a ‘Eliminations’ ranking?’

If you thought about the exam structure, there wasn’t a need for such a
ranking, right?

As he was thinking about it, an unbelievable sight began to unfold
before his eyes.

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +2\]

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +4\]

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +8\]

In the blink of an eye, the number of students Luce eliminated was
rapidly snowballing.

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +10\]

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +12\]

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +15\]

It didn’t stop. For some reason, she was on a killing spree!

“The top seat, this monster…! Has she gone mad?!”

A cold sweat ran down Tristan’s cheeks.

Mateo and Tristan both swallowed dryly and quickly grabbed their
bracelets and pressed the ‘Eliminations’ button. A map made of mana
grains unfolded before their eyes.

‘Blue’. The blue grain that represented the location of Luce Eltania was
reflected in their eyes.

…The devil was coming this way, to slaughter each and every one of them.

“Damn! Everyone, run! Lu-Luce Eltania is coming this way!”

“Tsk!”

Tristan barked orders at his men while his eyes widened, Mateo clicked
his tongue and began to flee as well.

Now was not the time for them to fight amongst themselves. For now, they
had to survive.

Luce Eltania. None of the first-year students in the Magic Department
stood a chance against her overwhelming strength. Especially when she
was slaughtering them with such ferocity.

If one came face to face with her, they would be eliminated without
fail.

「Geyser (Water Element, ★4)」

*────Pyuuuuuuuu!!*

From Luce’s position, a stream of steaming hot water wildly surged
through the air, threatening to pierce the sky. It was an extremely
skilled \[Geyser\].

The helpless screams of the students who had been blown away by the
\[Geyser\] echoed powerlessly.

Tristan was horrified and started fleeing in terror. No matter how
conceited he was, it was always better to flee in the face of a monster
you could never defeat.

It was only then that he realized why there was an ‘Eliminations’
ranking.

At the prestigious Märchen Academy, there were always some freaks of
nature who were admitted. Like Dorothy Heartnova, who was called the
Star Witch, or Alice Carroll, the Student Council President.

No matter how much Märchen Academy’s educational policy was said to be
*the ‘Law of the Jungle’*, they couldn’t just sit back and watch as the
balance of the exam helplessly collapsed.

Therefore, there may be many reasons, but the biggest reason for the
creation of the ‘Eliminations’ ranking was…

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +18\]

When a predator appears, you should flee as quickly as possible.

✦✧✦✧

\[3rd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +1\]

“I finally found one!”

The underground warehouse of Deuros Hall was cluttered with old junk.

As Kaya made her way through the junk, she could sense the faint but
unusual mana.

After she searched through the box where she sensed the mana, she was
able to find one ‘Fell Card’.

Kaya looked at the card and felt a rush of joy that made her heart race.

‘Kaya, did you find the Fell card already? Your skills are improving day
by day.’

Kaya’s expression melted as she imagined Isaac praising her cynically.

“Hehehehe.”

She giggled as she put the Fell card into the small pouch in her arms.
It was a card case handed out in advance by the academy’s
administration.

‘I’ve got the hang of it now, Sir Isaac!’

Forty minutes into the exam.

It was much harder to find a Fell Card than she had anticipated, but she
managed to find one somehow. Not to mention, other students would
eventually find Fell Cards as they narrowed their down their search.

However, the exam would increasingly take on the aspect of a battle
royale.

‘The top seat is the biggest problem.’

Luce Eltania. She was hunting students indiscriminately, regardless of
Fell Cards. The scoreboard she had seen before she entered this building
showed that she had already eliminated 34 people.

She seemed to be purposely hunting down students and eliminating them.
She must be sensing their mana, not their Fell Cards. Otherwise, her
elimination count wouldn’t have increased so dramatically.

***I wondered if she was trying to eliminate all the competition, so she
could take her time searching for Fell Cards, or… if she was just
killing for the sake of killing.***

Either way, it was a chilling thought.

‘I want to fight with all my might at least once, but…’

Kaya had always had this thought when she looked at Luce. That was
always the case with being the second seat. She felt like she was barely
an arm’s length away from the top seat, but not being able to close the
distance was frustrating.

But she needed to be realistic. Her current goal was to collect 5 Fell
Cards within the time limit and achieve an excellent grade for the
end-of-semester evaluation. That would be the best way to beat the top
seat.

Kaya left Deuros Hall. Just in time, the engravings of the scoreboard
that floated in the sky were changing.

Fell

\[1st Place (Red) Mateo Jordana Fell Card +1\]

\[2nd Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +1\]

\[3rd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +1\]

\[4th Place (Yellow) Tristan Humphrey Fell Card +1\]

Eliminations

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +44\]

\[2nd Place (Yellow) Tristan Humphrey Eliminations +1\]

Luce Eltania was still on a rampage.

Ciel Carnedas, a freshman in the Magic Department and classmate of Kaya
from Class A, seemed to have made her way up on the scoreboard while
Kaya was looking for a Fell Card in the warehouse.

Tristan Humphrey appeared to have claimed a card by eliminating the
student who had gotten it just moments before.

Gradually, the number of students who were getting Fell Cards was
increasing. Naturally, it was the top students who dominated the
rankings.

‘What is Sir Isaac up to?’

However, Kaya’s attention was drawn to Isaac rather than the top
students.

She had no idea what he was going to do.

If he, who was widely perceived as weak, obtained one Fell Card and rose
to the top of the rankings, there was no telling how chaotic the
end-of-semester evaluations would become.

<span id="0038_39_-_End-of-Semester_Evaluation_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 39: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (3)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (3)**༻

Kaya garnered her second Fell Card by eliminating a Class-B male student
and as a result of this, she discovered something new about the
end-of-semester evaluation.

It was that if she had a Fell Card, it would be listed as in her
possession, even if she put it somewhere else.

She was able to discover this when her Fell Card telekinetically flew
away in the wrong direction after she had eliminated the male student.
In other words, as long as she made physical contact with the card, it
didn’t matter even if she hid elsewhere.

Of course, it didn’t mean anything. If you could just defeat them, the
card would come to you anyway.

‘In any case…’

Kaya looked up at the scoreboard floating in the sky.

…A female student was raising her score at an alarming rate.

Fell

\[1st Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +4\]

\[2nd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +2\]

\[3rd Place (Red) Mateo Jordana Fell Card +1\]

\[4th Place (Yellow) Tristan Humphrey Fell Card +1\]

\[5th Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Fell Card +1\]

Eliminations

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +53\]

\[2nd Place (Yellow) Tristan Humphrey Eliminations +4\]

\[3rd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Eliminations +4\]

\[4th Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Eliminations +3\]

Ciel Carnedas. After she found her first Fell Card, she found 3 more
cards in a mere 30 minutes.

Her speed was unbelievable.

“…….”

However, upon careful consideration, it made sense. During the class
placement evaluation, Ciel took a leisurely nap and had a late start,
yet she still managed to secure third place. She was faster than Luce
and Kaya in terms of scoring speed alone.

Even though she was always sleepy eyed and slept whenever she had a
chance, Ciel firmly held on to the 3rd place rank in Class A. She didn’t
even realize that she was a dark horse in this semester’s end-of-term
evaluation.

‘I have to do better.’

She vowed to beat Luce Eltania, but what if she fell down to third
place?

Kaya continued to move her feet without rest in search of Fell Cards.

✦✧✦✧

The sunset colors were slowly spreading across the sky. It had been two
hours since the end-of-semester evaluation began.

Kaya blankly stared at the scoreboard floating in the sky, her mouth
hanging open.

No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn’t understand Ciel’s
performance.

Fell

\[1st Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +7\]

\[2nd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +2\]

\[3rd Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Fell Card +2\]

\[4th Place (Black) Keridna Whiteclark Fell Card +2\]

\[5th Place (Red) Mateo Jordana Fell Card +1\]

Eliminations

\[1st Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Eliminations +62\]

\[2nd place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Eliminations +12\]

\[3rd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Eliminations +8\]

\[4th Place (Black) Keridna Whiteclark Eliminations +6\]

\[5th place (Yellow) Tristan Humphrey Eliminations +5\]

‘Why 7 Fell Cards…?’

Perhaps other students were perplexed by this as well.

The end-of-semester evaluation would be over once you had collected 5
Fell Cards. Even if you collected more than 5 Fell Cards, there were no
bonus points, so Professor Fernando advised against doing anything
unnecessary.

Once you had collected 5 Fell Cards, the designated location for
submission would automatically appear, so Ciel must have already figured
out her submission location.

In other words, it was meaningless for her to scrape up that many Fell
cards.

\[1st Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +8\]

\[1st Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +9\]

But it didn’t stop. Ciel’s Fell Card ranking was increasing at a
terrifying rate.

Ciel Carnedas, was she actually a genius beyond Luce? What a ridiculous
mana perception ability…!

It was as if she were showing the students who were taking the
end-of-semester evaluations, “This is who I am,” with those high
numbers.

“What are you thinking, Ciel Carnedas…?”

Kaya took care of her complex thoughts and selected ‘Fell’ on her
bracelet, looking at the map of the old Märchen Academy grounds. The
purple mana grain, which represented Ciel Carnedas, was in a place that
could be reached within 20 minutes by running from where Kaya currently
was.

***…I have no choice but to go and see myself.***

Kaya conjured wind magic at her feet and started moving towards the
place where Ciel was.

Whatever Ciel’s intentions were, she wanted to get five Fell Cards as
soon as possible, so she could turn the tables on her. Kaya’s goal was
to rank first in the end-of-semester evaluation.

Realistically, it was difficult for her to choose the option of ‘simply
looking for Fell Cards’. In that case, it would be best for her to
eliminate Ciel and take her Fell Cards. Perhaps other Class A students
were thinking the same thing.

That’s right. It was going to be a battle of the Class A students with
Ciel at the center of it all.

“……!”

*Gooooooooo───*

As Kaya walked past the blue rose garden, a murderous mana enveloped her
entire body, triggering her survival instincts.

She swallowed a breath and came to a halt in the middle of the rose
garden.

A woman with rose gold hair was slowly trudging towards Kaya.

She was a sophisticated-looking schoolgirl with a morpho
butterfly-colored hair tie. The floral path embroidered with blue roses
blended well with her atmosphere, as if it existed solely for her.

Above her head, water mana swirled with a clear blue light. Five blue
magic circles with a diameter of about 2m were engraved in the air
around it and followed her, ready to use water magic at any time to
eliminate her opponent.

Ciel Carnedas had been so noticeable that she had overlooked the top
student in the ‘Eliminations’ category.

She should’ve been paying attention to the slaughterer, the most
important person in this end-of-semester evaluation…!

Tension washed over her like a tidal wave. The strongest student in the
first year of the Magic Department was coming this way.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

Kaya drew her wand and prepared for battle.

Luce Eltania, the rose-gold-haired top seat, cast a glance at Kaya with
her emotionless eyes. When her eyes met Kaya’s, Kaya felt a chill run
through her body for a moment.

First seat and second seat. Only one rank separated them.

But that one wall that stood between them was more solid than she could
have imagined.

Luce also stopped in her tracks. The top seat and second seat stared at
each other from a distance in a flower garden full of blue roses.

The tension was high.

Kaya materialized a light green magic circle around her, ready to fire a
spell at any moment.

“Luce Eltania… Are you trying to take me down too?”

Luce didn’t answer.

Kaya knew that reaction. It was the same expression that Isaac had shown
her during the class placement evaluation – a look that said ‘you are
boring’.

***Sir Isaac is an amazing person, so even if he did that, you
shouldn’t…!***

Kaya frowned and pointed the wand in her right hand towards Luce. A
light green magic circle materialized in front of the wand.

It was a magic circle for \[Gale Fang\], a 5-star wind magic.

“Let me ask you one thing. It looks like you are deliberately getting
rid of students. What is the reason?”

Kaya asked in a tense voice.

Then Luce closed her eyes tightly and opened them again, revealing her
blue eyes, reminiscent of the sea.

“…Huh.”

Her face suddenly blushed. She seemed embarrassed to answer.

Kaya hadn’t expected such an innocent reaction from her.

“Because of my friend. Just in case, I wanted to clean up anyone who
might be dangerous…”

The expression ‘friend’ had the power to make Luce appear vulnerable.
Whenever that small ripple of emotion passed through her lips, she felt
her whole body shudder and her face flush.

‘A friend…?’

Class A only had 5 people. Kaya knew this because she was in the same
class as Luce.

‘Aren’t you friendless…?’

It was a very rude thought, but it was true. Luce was an outsider who
treated everyone coldly and was always alone. It was natural for her to
not have any friends.

Kaya suddenly remembered a rumor that had been going around among the
students up until the end-of-semester’s written exam.

Isaac and the top seat seemed to have an unusual relationship, the top
seat seemed to be interested in a commoner from Class D. The top seat,
who always treated others coldly, would only smile brightly at Isaac.
The top seat seemed to be constantly trying to stay by Isaac’s side.

And so on and so forth.

Rumors were just rumors. Kaya had dismissed them as ‘probably some kind
of misunderstanding.’

Isaac was always a person with a deep meaning behind his actions. In the
first place, judging people based on rumors was against Kaya’s beliefs.

Moreover, the other person involved in the rumor was Luce, who had a
cold attitude towards everyone. Surely, it must be nothing more than a
misunderstanding, Kaya thought.

‘Could it be… that friend…?’

***Isaac… Is she talking about him?***

Luce, who was aloof with everyone, harbored special feelings for Isaac…?
Could it be that the rumors were true?

Today, she was reminded once again of how beautiful Luce was.

As she pictured Luce smiling brightly only at Isaac, Kaya felt a tingle
in her chest for some reason.

Somehow, this fight…. she felt as if she couldn’t afford to lose here,
in more ways than one.

“……?”

Luce had second thoughts when she saw Kaya, who appeared to be burning
with a fierce determination. Kaya’s strong will could be felt in the air
and on her skin.

‘She could be a danger to Isaac, too… I have to take care of her.’

It didn’t matter. Luce would just have to get rid of her.

The blue magic circle that had materialized around Luce started glowing
even brighter.

It was a showdown. The moment anyone made even the slightest movement,
they would both unleash their magic on each other.

─It was then.

*Charakcharak─*

The mana grains engraved in the sky began to move in a frenzy. Luce and
Kaya maintained their combat stances while facing one another, then
glanced up to check the scoreboard.

Fell

\[1st Place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +9\]

\[2nd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +2\]

\[3rd Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Fell Card +2\]

\[4th Place (Black) Keridna Whiteclark Fell Card +2\]

\[5th Place (Red) Mateo Jordana Fell Card +1\]

\[3rd Place (Green) Kaya Astrean Fell Card +2\]

\[4th Place (Blue) Luce Eltania Fell Card +2\]

\[5th Place (Black) Keridna Whiteclark Fell Card +2\]

“Uh, uh…?”

Luce and Kaya stopped dead in their tracks. They weren’t the only ones.

Within the grounds of the old Märchen Academy, every student who was
taking the end-of-semester evaluation stopped.

The students who were fighting ceased combat.

All of the students who had been looking for their Fell Cards came to a
halt, their mouths wide open.

They looked as if they couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

They stared in disbelief at the Fell Card holder, who was ranked 1st.

Isaac.

He’d beaten all the top students and rose to first place in an instant.

✦✧✦✧

Shortly after the start of the end-of-semester evaluation.

My plan was simple.

I was going to find a strong person and stick to that person.

I remembered most, if not all, of the locations of the Fell Cards. It
was game knowledge I had gained from countless hours of playing ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱. I had even written my own game strategy walkthroughs
and posted them in internet cafés.

Therefore, all I had to do was find a suitable trading partner, tell
them where the Fell Cards were, and in exchange receive a promise of
protection and my share of Fell cards. Of course, the trading partner
should be someone who follows the principle of good faith and the duty
of a righteous administrator.

Kaya, who followed me without question, would be the best candidate. The
problem was that time was running out, and I had no idea where she could
be.

However, because the carriage carrying me arrived in front of the Seiran
Hall, I was able to visit one of the candidates I had in mind ahead of
time. She was a sleepyhead who would be holed up in a small forest until
halfway through the end-of-semester evaluation. She wasn’t far from
Seiran Hall.

When I arrived at a forest lake with clean water and fresh air, a pretty
girl with wavy blue short hair caught my eye.

She was sound asleep, her back against a tree. Her profile reflected in
my eyes was absolutely gorgeous.

The scenery around the lake was beautiful, with pure white sunlight
filtering through the cracks in the leaves. She completely integrated
into nature’s landscape, as if she were in a painting, to the point
where the title “Sleeping Beauty” ^1^T/N: In Korean, 잠자는 숲속의 공주
means Princess Sleeping in a Forest, which is what is widely known as
Sleeping Beauty. This small line used to describe Ciel was ‘숲속의
공주’, which is just ‘Princess in a Forest’, but that probably wouldn’t
make sense to most people. Just a reminder that this story will have a
lot of references to fairy tales. came to mind.

“Kreureung…”

Her distinctive snores were the only thing that disturbed her elegant
atmosphere.

She was Ciel Carnedas, a freshman of the Magic Department.

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Lv:** 92

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Water

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Kreureung…\]

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, you could find Ciel Carnedas sleeping in
this forest until midway through the end-of-semester evaluation.

She awakened in the second half and joined the end-of-semester
evaluation. From then on, the difficulty of the test drastically spiked.

‘If it’s Ciel, she fits my plan.’

She was the type of person who strictly kept her promises. After all,
she was the one who was trying to keep the promise that had been passed
down through the Carnedas family, ‘If you find the Child of Light, bring
them to the Divine Realm.’

***She’s trustworthy… right?***

***All right, let’s go.***

“Ciel Carnedas, I’ve come to make a deal!”

I strode up to Ciel with confidence.

At that moment.

「Fireball (Fire Element, ★3)」

Suddenly, a spherical flame the size of a yoga ball formed in the air,
and flew towards me at the speed of a pitcher throwing a baseball.

***…Please save me.***

Chapter 40: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (4)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (4)** ༻

*Waahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh─!*

“Uwah!”

I quickly threw myself to the side and avoided Ciel’s \[Fireball\].

The heat menacingly grazed my side. I was terrified.

“C-calm down! I didn’t come here to fight you!”

「Fireball (Fire Element, ★3)」

Then, another \[Fireball\] flew towards me.

Should I block it with \[Ice Wall\]? There was no way I could. Not only
was I at a disadvantage in terms of elements, the skill gap between Ciel
and I was far too great. Her \[Fireball\] would instantly melt my \[Ice
Wall\], turning me into charred meat.

Once again, I dodged the incoming attack. The \[Fireball\] passed me and
hit the ground, then turned into orange mana before it dispersed into
the wind.

…If I hadn’t trained my athletic ability, I would have already been hit.
Thank you, Knight Department!

“Who are you…? Who are you to disturb my sleep?”

Ciel spoke, her voice still hushed. Her head was lowered, and her violet
eyes only turned to look in my direction. Her expression was indifferent
and lifeless, as if the world disinterested her.

“How about sleeping in your dormitory instead of somewhere like this?”

“Are you picking a fight?”

Another \[Fireball\] the size of a yoga ball appeared next to Ciel. I
quickly panicked and raised my arms.

“No, calm down…! I came here to make a deal with you!”

“…….”

“Are you good at sensing the Fell Cards?”

“Words are pointless.”

Ciel’s \[Fireball\] gradually grew in size. It was big enough to cause
damage even with my reflexes taken into account.

Soon enough, the \[Fireball\] fiercely sliced through the air towards me
once more.

“Hey, let’s talk…!”

There was not enough time to activate \[Frost Explosion\], because it
took a while to condense the mana required for it.

In the end, I used the offensive spell I was most familiar with.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

I coiled icy cold flames around my hands and fired them at the
\[Fireball\] that flew towards me.

The \[Frostfire\] engulfed the \[Fireball\], but I was struck by the
aftermath.

*Waaaahhhhh─!*

“Kkeuhak!”

The high-temperature magic and the low-temperature magic collided,
causing an explosion of misty steam, which lightly blew my body away.

The \[Fireball\] lost some momentum from the collision but was still
raging onward. It pierced through the steam before it ultimately crashed
into the ground. I was saved by the steam explosion.

My body rolled around on the ground several times, and my school uniform
was soiled as a result. As I couldn’t completely avoid the \[Fireball\],
parts of my uniform were burned, and I was even scratched by the sharp
rocks as I rolled, tearing off pieces of my uniform and cutting my skin.

Only when I hit the rocks around me did my body come to a halt.

‘Wow, I almost died for real…’

I coughed and cleared my throat, as I grabbed the rocks for support to
stand up. My forearm that was scratched by the rocks was bloody. I could
tell because I had my sleeves rolled up. Damn it.

“Go away. The next one will be a four-star spell. You won’t be lucky
enough to avoid this one.”

***This bitch. Would it kill you to just talk a little!***

I wanted to protest, but I gave up because I was scared.

“Ha, I didn’t intend to use this…”

I grumbled and reached for the magic pouch inside my pocket.

Then, Ciel gently extended her hand towards me, perhaps feeling wary.
Fire mana began to gather in front of her, and an orange magic circle
appeared.

I had studied that technique and remembered it. It wasn’t \[Fireball\];
she was going to use the 4-star spell \[Sea of Fire\].

\[Sea of Fire\] was a spell that poured flames as if they were tsunamis.
It was no wonder why it had such a large area of effect, and as she said
before, it’d be impossible to avoid it as luckily as I had done before.

But I had a trump card up my sleeve.

Do you think I haven’t figured out a single strategy for you after I’d
played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ countless times?

Before Ciel used \[Sea of Fire\].

I swallowed dryly, and took out my trump card from my magic pouch.

“……?”

I saw Ciel’s eyes dart around, they slightly widened in shock. She was
definitely surprised.

“Let’s make a deal, Ciel.”

What I pulled out was a navy blue ‘pillow’ – A pillow of the highest
quality with an ergonomic design to ensure a comfortable night’s sleep.
It was a heroine-only item that was available at the secret shop, which
could significantly boost Ciel Carnedas’ affinity. The item was dubbed
*“The Pillow That Makes Anyone Pass Out.”* For Ian, it was unnecessary.

Ciel examined the shape of the pillow based on her numerous naps. As a
seasoned napper, she must have noticed that the pillow was of the
highest quality.

Her head, which had only glanced at me from the side, turned completely
towards me and the fire mana that had gathered to activate \[Sea of
Fire\] dispersed.

This pillow appealed to her.

She had slept against a hard tree without a pillow. Like a person
without an umbrella on a rainy day, it was bound to be in demand.

“That, that… Where did you get that?”

“You want it?”

Ciel gave an affirmative answer of silence. She was too proud to nod.

“Like I said before, I’m here to make a deal with you. If you fulfill my
request, not only will you get this pillow, but you will also recieve
some additional benefits.”

“What benefits?”

“You haven’t properly detected the Fell Cards yet, have you?”

“…How do you know that?”

I asked her that earlier. She didn’t listen to me at all.

Fell Cards were items that emitted a very weak trace of mana, so even
Class-A students couldn’t easily detect them. Ciel Carnedas was no
exception.

Since she had already decided to take a nap, Ciel planned to find a nice
spot where she could take a nap since she couldn’t detect the Fell Card.

It wasn’t a thoughtless action, however. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
Ciel awakens from her nap and joins the battle from the middle to the
latter part of「Act 3, Chapter 3, End of Semester Evaluation」, which
caused the difficulty level to spike. She decided to attack and loot
students who already had Fell Cards, reasoning that it would be more
efficient because she was stronger.

“I’ll find Fell Cards for you, and give you this pillow as well.”

“I know who you are. An inferior student from Class-D with Grade-E mana.
How could you possibly expect to find the Fell Cards?”

“Come and see.”

Ciel swept her eyes over me with suspicion.

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Psychology:** \[Suspecting you of having set a
trap.\]

“If you’re really suspicious, just remember that you’re always in a
position to attack me. If you even have a sliver of doubt about my
actions, then you can just eliminate me from the competition.”

“…….”

Ciel furrowed her brows and pondered for a moment before she got up and
followed me.

Ciel’s height was up to my neck. I smiled as I looked down at her. It
was a capitalist smile meant to relieve my opponent’s vigilance.

Of course, despite my efforts, she did not reciprocate. She simply
covered her mouth and yawned, with a tired expression.

“Hurry up.”

***Yes, of course.***

I knew where the Fell Cards were in this forest. After walking for a
while, I came to a rock shaped like a raccoon’s head.

*Here it is*. I squatted down and picked up a slightly larger rock that
laid next to it.

Sure enough, a Fell Card was there.

“How…?”

Ciel appeared surprised, as evident by the widening of her sleepy eyes.

But I didn’t touch the card. This was due to the fact that the person
who made physical contact with the card was considered to be in
possession of the card.

That’s right, physical contact. Fell Cards were treated as the
possession of the last person who touched them, so even if you didn’t
kill the opponent, you could make them your own by simply stealing the
card.

But I didn’t have to think that far. Because once the cards are
‘exchanged’, it would end peacefully. My in-game knowledge made this all
possible.

“You are from Class D, right? What kind of monstrous mana perception do
you have…?”

“Think of it as a trade secret.”

Ciel narrowed her eyes and stared at me suspiciously.

“I sensed your mana level when our magic clashed earlier, and there’s no
way someone as weak as you could have this kind of mana perception.
What’s going on? If you don’t tell me, there will be bloodshed.”

I quickly pushed the pillow in front of her.

“…But it’s a trade secret, so it can’t be helped. Everyone has secrets
they want to keep. So, what kind of deal do you want to make with me?”

I stood up and looked at Ciel. Finally, we could finally get down to
business.

“I’ll be your guide for the Fell Cards. Wouldn’t it be better to finish
this test quickly and have more time to nap? Of course, I’ll even give
you this pillow, but on two conditions.”

I thumped my chest.

“First and foremost, you must protect me. Second, you must collect all
of the Fell Cards at once and then give me five of them. So I can pass
the exam.”

Students would be targeted if they had a Fell Card in the
end-of-semester evaluation, and the holding status was relayed in
real-time, as well as the holder’s location.

Moreover, there were 5 Fell Cards that I needed to collect.

In other words, if a weakling like me tried to collect Fell Cards
quickly, I would only be targeted by students, and easily eliminated. If
lost all the cards I collected, I wouldn’t be able to unlock my
bracelet, and have to attend the supplementary classes. As a result, I
would be unable to prepare for *The* *Thunderbird Subjugation.*

“…Is that all?”

I nodded.

Ciel showed me her slender right palm, and I gently slapped my left palm
against hers.

“Deal done. Pillow.”

Ciel said calmly, held out her hand, and I handed her the pillow.

She hugged the pillow, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. Soon, her
expression melted like ice cream on a midsummer day.

✦✧✦✧

With Ciel by my side, the search for Fell Cards was a breeze.

Ciel was always impressed whenever I found a Fell card. Although she
didn’t show it, I could tell through \[Psychological Insight\].

If any students came to bother us, Ciel dealt with them on her own. All
I had to do was relax and act as a guide.

When we found the 5th Fell Card, mana grains popped out of her bracelet
and formed a map. One of the gleaming grains pointed to a specific
location, which served as the submission point.

For reference, there were a total of 10 submission points, and when we
obtain the 5th Fell Card, one of these places would be displayed at
random. I took that into account as I guided Ciel to a place that wasn’t
too far off from it.

By the way.

‘Why is Luce rampaging like this…?’

**I don’t know why.** ***I wonder what else went wrong with this
scenario.***

…In any case, I couldn’t stop here. My first priority was to collect the
Fell Cards as quickly as possible and pass this test. I relegated Luce’s
rampage to a lower priority.

“Who are you, really?”

Ciel inquired when we had found the 7th Fell Card. It was the time when
we had entered the honeycomb building that held 2 Fell Cards.

It was a large central hall. The interior of the building, which once
boasted luxurious facilities, was now rusted and worn with the passage
of time.

Ciel walked alongside me, clutching the pillow I had given her.

With a voice as cold as frost, Ciel asked.

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Psychology:** \[Suspects that you are a strong
person hiding your skills.\]

It seemed that Ciel had thought about it a lot while walking around with
me. Even though she said that I was weak at first.

*“What is your true identity?”, “You can’t have such great mana
perception with only a tiny bit of mana. Mana perception is directly
related to the absolute amount of maximum mana that one possesses.”*

***Isn’t that too harsh? I’m level 57, a level that can compete against
the top Class C students.***

…Well, it wasn’t unreasonable.

From Ciel’s point of view, who was talented even compared to Class B
students, the expression that my mana was at the level of a speck of
dust could be seen as a reasonable statement.

“It’s impossible to hide one’s mana. But it’s also impossible for you to
have this level of mana perception with your mana. How can such a
contradiction exist?”

Ciel shot me a cold glare.

“The only way for that to be possible is if you can hide your mana.
There’s no way you reached the level of an Archwizard at your age, and
it’s impossible to bribe the proctors because of the Pact.”

“There are two Fell Cards here.”

I gave out the information as a way of telling her to shut up and as
expected, Ciel looked puzzled.

“It wasn’t just one…? As I thought… you can sense even that…”

I shook my head.

When I first entered this building, I noticed the shape of the grass in
the front yard. I washed my eyes and looked around, but there was no
sign of anyone having walked on it, which meant that the two cards must
still be there.

“…Tsk.”

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Psychology:** \[Feels inferior to you.\]

Ciel had no interest in those weaker than herself.

But now she was starting to harbor an inferiority complex towards me.
She even clicked her tongue.

…I’m a background character, aren’t I?

“…Let’s hurry up and find the rest.”

“You’re walking faster all of a sudden…”

“You talk too much.”

Ciel disregarded my words. I kept my mouth shut and quietly followed her
will, even if this was a transactional relationship, I knew there was
bound to be a certain amount of power involved.

It wasn’t like she wasn’t going to fulfill her obligations anyway.

We found the 2 Fell Cards in the building.

\[1st place (Purple) Ciel Carnedas Fell Card +9\] was engraved on the
scoreboard. Even Kaya, who was in second place right now, only had two
cards…

I know it was my own work, but that was some real good aggro.

“I’m done now,” Ciel said after she found the ninth Fell Card.

The place where I found the card was a spacious hall reminiscent of a
wedding hall. The overall atmosphere was elegant and full of dignity.

The walls were adorned with a beautiful gold and white design, with
green vines that dotted along the walls, and on those vines bloomed
brilliantly colored flowers that resembled passionflowers.

It was a place that hadn’t been maintained, and the signs of age were
evident, which gave it a distinct feel.

Ciel and I stood in front of the podium, while we faced each other.
Anyone who saw us would think that we were having a simple wedding. Of
course, I was currently dressed in a dusty school uniform that was far
from wedding attire.

“There’s one card left, right? This card is yours.”

“I’ll find the other one on my own.”

Perhaps it was her wounded pride. Well, it was understandable when one
considered the fact that the guy she deemed to be inferior to herself
showed an incredible mana perception that was incomparable to her own.

Of course, that was just Ciel’s speculation. I didn’t mention anything
about having found the Fell Cards using my mana perception.

I was in a position where I couldn’t come up with any other reason, so I
didn’t deny it.

“For now, take this.”

Ciel handed me a flimsy stack of cards.

The submission location was random. Even I didn’t know where my
submission location would appear, though I figured it would be best to
get the Fell Cards here as soon as possible and go.

I received the stack of cards and counted them.

***One, Two, Three, Four, Five. Perfect.***

Outside the window, I could hear the collision of mana grains. \[1st
Place (White) Isaac Fell Card +5\] appeared on the scoreboard engraved
in the sky.

Mana grains also flowed from my bracelet, and formed a map which marked
my submission location.

Luckily, it was the closest one to me. A distance I could reach in less
than twenty minutes if I ran.

“Let’s go.”

“Yeah.”

Ciel nodded, and her face turned serious as she hugged the pillow I’d
given her with both arms.

It must have been because she couldn’t predict what kind of mayhem would
unfold from now on.

<span id="0040_41_-_End-of-Semester_Evaluation_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 41: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (5)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (5)**༻

The two daughters of the Astrean family took different paths.

The eldest daughter followed in her father’s footsteps – the Sword
Saint, Gerald Astrean – and became a knight.

On the other hand, the second daughter admired her mother – a genius
wizard, Historia Astrean – and chose the path of a wizard.

However, even though their paths diverged, Gerald Astrean’s ironclad
rule remained the same.

*‘Be the best wherever you are’*. It would be strange if they weren’t
the best, he reasoned. They had both inherited the talents of a
swordsman and a wizard.

As a result, the sisters were admitted into Märchen Academy, the most
prestigious academy on the continent.

The eldest daughter had firmly held her top position in the Knight
Department, and she had even passed the Imperial Knights entrance exam.

The second daughter entered the Magic Department as the second seat of
the first-years.

She wasn’t the top seat. She wasn’t the best.

But she knew she had the talent, so she nodded her head and said, *‘I’ll
just have to work hard,’* and devoted herself to magic training and
study. She believed that the fruits of her blood, sweat, and tears would
surely make her the top seat.

And so, she tried hard.

But no matter how hard she tried, the gap with the top seat showed no
signs of being closed.

In a flower garden full of blue roses, Luce and Kaya stared at the
scoreboard for a while.

It was a situation where the existence they both cherished had overtaken
the top students and achieved first place.

Kaya’s eyes lit up as she exclaimed, *‘As expected of Sir Isaac!’* while
Luce’s mouth dropped open.

Isaac, he got 5 Fell Cards and took first place at once.

Ciel Carnedas, she dropped to second place after she had lost 5 Fell
Cards.

That didn’t mean she was eliminated, however. If she had been
eliminated, her name would have disappeared from the leaderboard.

The implications were clear. Isaac and Ciel Cardenas had worked
together.

Luce judged with a smile that was as faint as the moonlight in the
middle of the night. She whispered softly, “Isaac, you had a plan.”

The two lowered their heads with a sense of satisfaction.

But they had to return to reality. They had to fight the enemy in front
of them.

“Whew.”

Thanks to Isaac, Kaya’s spirit was lifted. She took a deep breath to
calm herself down, and coldly glared at Luce.

From now on, Kaya decided to only think about herself.

Although she was momentarily excited about Isaac’s situation, she
couldn’t get too worked up in front of such a formidable foe, as it
would only exacerbate the difficulty of the fight.

She calmly adjusted her posture to an appropriate level.

“Luce Eltania, I’ve always wanted to fight you someday.”

2nd place. Ever since she came to Märchen Academy, Kaya had never left
her position as the second seat.

She wanted to catch up with the top seat. The gap between them ate away
at Kaya’s self-esteem like a rat in a cupboard, which only served to
fuel her inferiority complex.

No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t get any closer to her, only
further away. She felt as if she were swimming in an endless sea.

Kaya lowered her eyes and spoke with deep sincerity, “From the very
beginning, I was determined to surpass you, the top seat, as the second
seat.”

Others praised her for being the second seat, but the only thing that
caught Kaya’s gaze was the back of Luce’s head.

“I will surpass you. That’s why I’ve been working so hard. So, this
fight is for me…!”

“……?”

Kaya’s resolute voice dissipated powerlessly the moment she saw Luce’s
confused expression at her words.

Luce calmly tilted her head, as if she had heard her voice for the very
first time.

An ominous thought flashed through Kaya’s mind.

Luce’s following indifferent response, which seemed to indicate that she
wasn’t interested, had swallowed Kaya whole.

“I didn’t know you were the second seat…”

The top seat, Luce Eltania, was an existence Kaya Astrean, the second
seat, wanted to catch up with. The existence that had always stood firm
in front of her, and guarded her place.

Kaya had been running diligently, while keeping the back of the top seat
in her sight.

For Luce, the top seat, the second seat or whatever was of little
interest.

Even during the mana evaluation, she didn’t listen to Professor
Fernando’s announcement of mana capacity rankings. She had never even
glanced at the report cards posted in Orphin Hall.

She knew she would be the strongest and get the highest grades anyway.
It didn’t matter one bit.

Even now, all Luce wanted to do was defeat Kaya and go see Isaac.

Kaya gripped her wand tightly and channeled her mana, her mouth tightly
clenched.

✦✧✦✧

The blue rose garden was drenched as if a sudden shower had poured down.

The majestic glow of the setting sun seemed to have faded. Her throat
was parched as she quietly sat in the flower bed and admired the view.

Her dark green hair and uniform, both thoroughly soaked, refused to dry.

In reality, only a short amount of time had passed. However, for Kaya,
who was sitting by the blue rose garden, it felt like an eternity.

***She lost.***

Kaya’s wind magic was far too weak to push away Luce’s heavy water
magic.

After exchanging several blows, Luce left indifferently. She believed
Kaya was unable to fight and walked away as if she had just stepped on a
bug.

Kaya couldn’t even stand up as her legs gave out. She could only blankly
stare at the distant sky.

It seemed that she had narrowly avoided elimination. If she had been
eliminated, a signal would have appeared on her bracelet, and an exam
proctor would have come to escort her away by now.

“Euh…”

It felt as if her ribs were broken. She felt a tingling sensation in her
intestines, as if something had ruptured.

“…Hik.”

Kaya wiped the edges of her eyes with her wet collar. She was glad that
Luce was a water element user.

✦✧✦✧

***I have to hurry up and pass the end-of-semester evaluation so that I
can prepare for the Thunderbird Subjugation.***

Ciel and I made our way to the submission location where I needed to go.

Ciel walked at a jaunty pace while she cradled the pillow I had given
her with both arms. I would have preferred to run, but running was like
rat poison to her, so I had to be grateful for her quick steps.

Maybe it was because I was now ranked first, but the number of students
who attacked me had increased compared to before.

All of them were easily knocked out with one shot of Ciel’s magic,
however…

“Clearly, since the Class D kid took first place, there will be many
envious people who can’t stand that thought, hurriedly rushing in
without knowing any better.”

All of them were dangerous opponents to me, but in front of Ciel, they
were just another punching bag.

“… Stop.”

「Flame Pillar (Fire Element, ★4)」

*Hwaaaaarr——!!*

Suddenly, a pillar of flame menacingly rose in front of us. I would have
been charred black if Ciel hadn’t reached out her arm to stop me.

The \[Pillar of Fire\] quickly disintegrated into powder, which
scattered into red light and disappeared. It seemed to be a spell to
stop us in our tracks, rather than to harm us.

Ciel’s eyes followed the source of the spell. I also turned my head in
the direction of Ciel’s gaze.

It was a time when the sky was slowly taking on a vivid sunset color. On
the roof of a nearby tall abandoned building, a female student was
perilously perched on the railing with her eyes peering in our
direction.

Her short pink hair that fell slightly below her shoulders was
fluttering in the wind. Under her school uniform skirt was the fair skin
of her smooth, long legs, revealing delicate curves.

In front of her outstretched right hand, was a bright red magic circle,
ready to shoot magic at any moment.

She was Keridna Whiteclark, one of the top honor students of Class A.

\[Keridna Whiteclark\] **Lv:** 90

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Wind

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Hoping to kill your spirit by denouncing you.\]

Keridna Whiteclark had a very high \[Elemental Efficiency\], and the
higher the \[Elemental Efficiency\], the less mana it took to cast a
single spell.

It also increased the range of magic and the success rate of joint
attacks. None of the Magic Department’s first-years could contend with
her in terms of \[Elemental Efficiency\].

As a result, Keridna was one of the most feared opponents in battle, as
she could create more variables than anyone else among the first-year
students.

Keridna had a menacing smile on her face. It was like a villain saying,
*‘You’re done now,’* and with a wicked smile on her face, she began to
speak.

“────!”

…But it was inaudible.

It sounded like she was shouting at the top of her lungs, but it kept
getting drowned out by the evening wind.

“Can you hear what she is saying?”

I asked Ciel and she shook her head.

“────!”

Keridna passionately shouted something as she made flashy gestures, like
she was performing in a play.

I suppose it would be polite to respond, but no matter how hard I
strained my ears, I couldn’t understand what she had actually said.

***I’m sorry, but I don’t want to pointlessly waste my time.***

As I thought that, Ciel and I turned our heads and started to walk away.
Keridna Whiteclark began to shout frantically with a bewildered look on
her face. I, of course, had a hard time hearing what she was talking
about.

And at that moment…

「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」

“……!!”

…A menacing whirlwind raged overhead.

After I had sensed it, I quickly stepped forward and threw my body to
the side, embracing Ciel.

*Whooooosh──!!*

As the whirlwind struck the ground, a fierce wind spread in all
directions.

I rolled on the floor as I hugged the small-sized Ciel.

“Are you okay?”

Ciel glared at me with her half-open eyes, hugging her pillow tightly.

“…Move.”

She replied sharply, as if annoyed, but her expression remained
unchanged. She acted as if she were unaffected by the earlier attack.

I helped Ciel to her feet, and we stood up together. Then, a vain blond
aristocrat caught my eye. He gazed down at us from the roof of a nearby
shed, a smug smile on his face.

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 77

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Wants to humiliate and eliminate you.\]

“Ha! So that’s how it is for a Grade-E commoner! Were you begging a
Class-A student? You can’t live without leeching off others! How
ridiculous!”

Tristan Humphrey laughed loudly*, ‘Hahahaha!*’, then coughed to clear
his throat.

However, I had no time to worry about him. I quickly tried to move
forward with Ciel.

Soon after, the earth shook, and another bolt of magic slammed into me
and Ciel.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

A solid rock wall powerfully erupted from the ground to entrap Ciel and
I. The rock walls reached high into the sky. It was a thick wall that
exuded powerful mana.

“Ciel.”

“I know.”

I interlocked my fingers and began to condense ice mana through the gap
in between my hands and at the same time, Ciel materialized three blue
magic circles towards the rock wall.

──「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」 ──「Hydro Cannon (Water Element,
★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaah───!*

*Boom, boom, boom, boom───!*

My \[Frost Explosion\] caused a crack in the rock wall while Ciel’s
magic circle shot out water with the power of a cannonball.

*Kwadadadadang──!*

The \[Rock Wall\] collapsed. Shards of rock and ice scattered into the
air and at the same time, a wind of moisture-laden dust blew in, and in
it, Ciel and I assumed our battle stances.

Eventually, the dust settled.

The landscape reflected in my eyes was a bleak situation.

Not only Tristan, but a group of about a dozen students, who I assumed
to be Tristan’s subordinates, surrounded us.

In addition to that, there were twin female students who came out of
nowhere, a long-haired male student who was giggling with a sinister
aura, and even a magic prodigy with a tiny physique. All of them were
top students in Class B.

Even Keridna Whiteclark, a Class A student, who was muttering something
on the roof, glared at us like a predator would at its prey.

And then.

“I like combat.”

In the dust that slowly settled, a husky female voice came from the
front.

The owner of that voice had a wooden bat studded with topaz-colored
magic stones slung over one of her shoulders.

Ciel could handle Keridna Whiteclark. However, if *‘that woman’ was*
added to the mix, our chances of winning would really disappear.

The dust had completely settled now.

The image of ‘*that woman*’, stood in our way. I could clearly see her
in my field of vision.

“So I’ve been waiting for this battlefield to ripen, and then I was
planning to smash everything to pieces,” said the orange-haired pretty
girl holding the wooden bat.

She wore a school uniform with tight-fitting pants that accentuated her
wide hips and legs. Her free hand was in her pocket, and her insolent
attitude made her look like a delinquent.

Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail. Her white shirt was
unbuttoned, which revealed her smooth abs and the black bra-like tank
top she wore underneath.

‘I wanted to finish it before it got to this point.’

I bit my lip. The situation had shaped up to be the worst-case scenario.

In the original ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ scenario without Luce’s
rampage, if I had to choose the most dangerous person in the
end-of-semester evaluation, it would undoubtedly be the orange-haired
female student that stood in front of me.

She took her time during the first part of the exam, and leisurely
enjoyed the meat and drinks she had prepared ahead of time. Then she
joined the battle during the second half of the end-of-semester
evaluation.

The difficulty level, which had already increased due to Ciel’s
intrusion in the mid-to-late half, skyrocketed to an insane level. This
was because that orange-haired woman had randomly eliminated students.

The reason was simple: *‘Combat is fun’.*

“What’s up with you? Isn’t it getting really fun now?! Aah?!”

The orange-haired girl exclaimed as she let out a giggle. She was
Lisetta Lionheart, a Class A delinquent.

She had established herself as the final barrier.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Lv:** 94

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Wonders what your identity is.\]

As a member of a renowned family of knights, House Lionheart, she had
been educated with an emphasis on etiquette and dignity.

However, after she entered the academy, she broke free from her family’s
suffocating traditions and began to live life according to her own
personality, in short, she became a reckless girl.

Lisetta Lionheart.

Cold sweat trickled down my cheeks.

Keridna Whiteclark and Lisetta Lionheart from Class A, as well as the
top students of Class B such as Tristan Humprey and his around a dozen
subordinates, and a slew of other Class B students, had all targeted us
at the same time.

These people probably didn’t even consider the possibility that their
actions right now could lead to the end of the world.

“Even if you take us down, everyone here will be your enemy, so what’s
the point?”

“My desire. To destroy everyone and everything.”

“…Come on, cut us some slack. This is so unfair.”

“I don’t take orders from those weaker than me. If you want to make me
submit, prove you’re stronger than me, fool.”

I tried testing Lisetta Lionheart, not expecting anything, and her
reaction was as predicted. Was she intentionally doing that?

“If you dominate me, I’ll do whatever you ask of me. Whether that be
stripping off my clothes and dancing on top of you, telling me to be
your lover, or fulfilling your obscene fantasies at night. I’ll do
*anything*.”

The male students around her started to blush. Her provocative words and
actions seemed to set their hearts ablaze, which stirred their manhood.

Lisetta’s ideal type was clear-cut. A male peer who was stronger than
her. If she met such a man, she was prepared to give her heart and body.
In fact, it was as if she was talking about her true desire.

“In the first place, Ciel Carnedas, I don’t think you’re the type to
team up with anyone?” Lisetta said, her golden eyes fixed on Ciel.

“What the hell is that man doing to help you?”

Ciel took a step in front of me, and hugged the pillow I’d given her
tightly. She extended her right arm towards Lisetta – an orange magic
circle materialized in front of her right hand.

“You are noisy. Fight me or shut up.”

Ciel’s intention to fight silenced the air.

Lisetta smirked, and lowered the wooden bat slung over her shoulder. She
tightly grasped the handle with both her hands.

It was no ordinary bat but a magic tool modified to increase the power
of rock magic. Just like Kaya’s wand, it was a weapon exclusively for
Lisetta.

“Yes, that reaction! I like it, Ciel Carnedas!”

Lisetta shouted with a thirst to fight, her eyes widened to cover an
even larger area of her whites. She was like a gladiator who let her
lust for battle spill out like a volcanic eruption.

Tristan Humphrey, his subordinates, and the top students of Class B also
deployed magic circles and prepared themselves for battle. The same was
true of Keridna Whiteclark, who had aimed at us from the building’s roof
earlier.

There were only students stronger than me, but I couldn’t stay still. I
moved to stand next to Ciel, hoping to help even just a little bit.

But she held out her arm to stop me.

“Don’t get in the way. I don’t think you’re going to help us at all,
seeing how you used such crude magic to break the \[Rock Wall\]
earlier.”

***Crude magic…?***

***If you had taken a hit from my \[Frost Explosion\], you wouldn’t be
saying that.***

“…To be honest, I’m still not convinced. Are you acting weak in order to
get out of this situation? Or are you some kind of freak with
exceptional mana perception?”

Surprisingly, neither answer was correct.

***It’s true that I am weak, and my mana perception is at a terrible
level, even worse than yours. Isaac’s body is just originally like
that.***

“…Whatever I do, it’s my decision.”

***Anyway, you’re not trying to run away, but you’re trying to protect
me in accordance with our deal.***

***What good am I if I can’t help you?***

“You’re an idiot.”

“An idiot… what…?”

“Let’s try to write a three-line acrostic poem with…”

I accidentally said that out loud, and quickly tried fixing my mistake.

Ciel glared at me. Nonetheless, it was a relief that there was no time
to attack me because the situation was desperate. Although it was a
little irritating not to rhyme with ‘Ba’.^1^T/N: 바보야 – Idiot, which
is what she called him at first. So, they would use each character from
that word 바 보 야, for the poem, where 바 is ‘Ba’ here.

***…Either way, I have no choice but to fight. To protect myself from
those who are aiming at me, and to survive, I must fight my way through
them.***

***To be honest, I’m terrified of failing. Even for Ciel, taking them
down is too much, and I’m still weak.***

But with a deep breath, I gathered my emotions and shook off my fears.
There was no point in being scared. I steeled myself, and remembered all
the battles I’d fought so far.

I took an old dagger from inside my school uniform and drew it from its
scabbard. In my right hand I held the *Sheath of Disaster*, and in my
left hand. I held a normal blade.

It was no different from usual.

I would leap over obstacles and slay the demons.

“……?”

…What the hell? I was determined to be brave, but somehow the atmosphere
was strange.

Lisetta’s face, which had been so fiery just a moment ago, was now
filled with wariness.

Keridna, who watched us from the top of the building, was troubled.

Even Tristan, his men, and the Class B honor students were tense.

None of their gazes lingered on me or Ciel.

“Isaac…?”

A voice as soft as moonlight came from behind me, and as soon as I heard
it, I understood the whole situation.

Ciel and I turned around, and our gazes were drawn to a graceful female
student who stood a decent distance from us. Her rose gold hair, as well
as the morpho butterfly-colored braids that hung down the sides of her
head, reflected the sunset light.

Her face, which usually gave me a gentle smile, was cast in a deep
shadow due to the backlight.

“……!”

The female student with rose-gold hair swallowed a gasp. Her eyes
widened as if in shock.

I could feel her blue oceanic eyes scanning me in detail.

Only then did I realize that my outward appearance was in disarray. I
must have appeared to have come here after tumbling around hard
somewhere. It was all Ciel’s fault.

The powerful mana flowing from Luce seemed to weigh heavily on the air.
The intense, murderous aura that emanated from her was enough to send
chills down my spine.

“Who made you so…?”

An icy-cold voice cut through the air.

Then, Ciel, who stood next to me, pointed in the direction of Lisetta
with a brazen face. It was surprisingly audacious.

Soon, Luce’s cold and cynical gaze pierced through Ciel and drove a
wedge into the enemies behind her. It was an unexpected turn of events,
even for me.

Chapter 42: - End-of-Semester Evaluation (6)
============================================

༺ **End-of-Semester Evaluation (6)**༻

To Luce Eltania, others were like a hedgehog whose entire body was
covered with sharp quills. If she got too close, the quills would prick
and sting.

The Candy House Witch^1^The ‘Witch in the Candy House’ from ‘Hansel and
Gretel’. Some may also refer to Candy House as Gingerbread House. was
dead.

The one who had taken in Luce – who had been abandoned by her parents
and had nowhere else to go. Someone who meant so much to Luce had died
right in front of her in a futile manner.

***Candy House Witch, you sacrificed your life for the people you wanted
to protect, and were recorded in history as the infamous Great Witch of
Heaven’s Wrath, a name still cursed by people to this very day.***

History wasn’t just a relic of the past. It was also a work of art that
was molded by the hands of the people who lived in the present.

As such, the ending was too grueling for Luce to endure, and a deep
sense of distrust washed over her. A deep-seated disgust and hatred for
humans had taken root and sprouted.

It happened when she was only 10 years old.

Luce had forgotten everything she had seen that day, but she vividly
remembered the pain of that time whenever someone spoke to her.

So, she lived like a mute, and avoided others.

Eventually, she developed a knack for hiding memories she didn’t want to
recall deep inside her mind.

However, the painful memories lingered like an echo, and anyone’s
approach still felt like a needle was piercing her heart.

And then, for the first time, she made a friend.

It was very unusual for Luce, who normally felt disgusted and hateful
whenever someone spoke to her.

They ate alone together, they exchanged small talk and silly jokes, and
even studied together. She taught him things he struggled with, helped
him train, encouraged him, and…

They hadn’t even been friends for a month, yet the time she spent with
him gave Luce a sense of fulfillment that couldn’t be compared to any
she had experienced prior.

He was the only person she didn’t hate.

After she had witnessed the Candy House Witch’s death at the age of ten,
Luce had closed herself off from others. But to her, this friend felt
like an incredibly precious existence, he felt like the sunrise that
illuminated the darkness of dawn. And unlike everyone else, this friend
made her feel neither disgust nor hatred.

“…”

Under the sky tinged with the color of sunset, Luce’s eyes caught a
glimpse of Isaac. A scorched school uniform that held traces of fire
magic. In addition, he was covered with dust and dirt, it was as if he
had rolled around somewhere.

Through the tears in his uniform, blood stains were visible. She
wondered who was responsible for such injuries.

His rolled-up sleeve revealed the large bruises on his forearm. She was
curious as to who had beaten him so severely.

Even a single droplet on the surface of a calm body of water could
create circular ripples that spread out several times over; the
appearance of Isaac, on the other hand, was like dropping a boulder into
calm waters. This caused a turbulent flow within Luce’s heart.

“…Luce?”

***It’s a pleasant sound. That’s why it hurts me so much when you call
my name.***

Right now, she knew that this situation was part of an exam. It was only
natural to get hurt. Luce understood that in her head.

However, no matter how much she believed that, if Isaac was being
targeted by dozens of enemies, and they were all trying to hurt him…

Luce felt overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness as her anger soared and
became unbearable.

*Puahhhhh───!!*

In an instant, her water mana converted into the water element and
scattered a clear blue light that swirled overhead. It was grand enough
to encompass the whole area.

Her mana control was so excellent that not even a single droplet of
water splashed around her. This meant that she could use even a single
droplet of water to attack.

At the same time, five blue magic circles about 2m in diameter
materialized around her – each with a 5-star rating or higher. They were
all ready to activate, so she could unleash their spells all at once.

The enemies that had targeted Isaac and Ciel all swallowed their saliva
and became wary of Luce.

They were in no position to act hastily. Everyone here was within the
range of Luce’s magic. She was in a position where she could eliminate
anyone at any time.

“R-run away…! We will never win against the top seat…!”

“If you run away, I will kill you.”

Tristan hurriedly ordered his men to flee, but Lisetta’s murderous voice
cut him off.

“I can’t stand it when a coward tries to flee before even fighting.
Shouldn’t you at least cut something if you’ve drawn your sword?”

Tristan and his men stared at Lisetta with terrified faces.

“Besides, if I steal the Fell Cards, you’ll all be my enemies! Wouldn’t
it be more fun for me if there were more of you to fight against, huh?!”

Something was off about Lisetta. At least Tristan thought so.

Lisetta glared at the top seat with a smirk. From the start, she had no
intention of passing this test quickly. She was just excited about the
prospect of how many enemies she could fight if she got the Fell Cards
in such a chaotic situation.

In such a chaotic situation… for someone who loved intense battles like
her, there was no way she could not be excited.

Her entire body shuddered. The always stoic top seat was enraged. She
couldn’t believe she was getting nervous!

Lisetta giggled and gripped the bat tightly with both hands. Soon, a
light brown magic circle materialized in front of her.

“…”

The person who sat on the roof, Keridna Whiteclark, also had no
intention of running away. She was simply annoyed with the top seat.

Ever since she joined Class A, Keridna had been kind to her Class A
classmates. It was clear that they were different from the rest of the
students, and she intended to use them as potential connections to
solidify her social foundation.

However, Luce had never even acknowledged Keridna’s greetings.

Luce Eltania always had her brow furrowed and looked at Keridna as if
she were looking at garbage. Luce never said anything to her, she only
expressed her displeasure.

She couldn’t argue with the top seat, but now she had the opportunity to
unleash her rage on that arrogant face.

Although her mind was confused for a moment by the top seat’s sudden
appearance, she was composed now.

Keridna broke out into a cold sweat and with a forced smile, she
unleashed her light red magic circle.

“…Isaac.”

Luce turned her gaze towards Isaac. A gentle smile hung over her face,
it was a gentle smile that didn’t match the eerie swirls and magic
circles that formed overhead in the slightest.

“Go quickly.”

So that Isaac could pass the exam and be safe…

…Luce was going to help him escape.

“Thank you, Luce.”

After he judged the situation, Isaac simply nodded his head and began
running in the direction of Lisetta.

“That Grade E commoner!”

Soon after Tristan had shouted, a light green whirlwind was sent towards
Isaac.

The moment Luce tried to protect Isaac with a water barrier \[Water
Wall\].

「Firestorm (Fire Element, ★5)」 + 「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」

= 「Fire Dragon (Fire+Wind Element)」

*Roarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr──────!*

The raging whirlwind turned away from Isaac and began to soar through
the air like an oriental dragon while wrapped in flames. Keridna’s
\[Firestorm\] was directed at Tristan’s \[Whirlwind\], which resulted in
a synergized attack.

It wasn’t a predetermined plan, but Keridna had anticipated what Tristan
would do and used her fire magic to synergize with it. Obviously, it was
not an easy feat to accomplish.

Keridna waved the wand she held like a baton. The whirlwind that was
spiraled in flames roamed the skies at her command. At each passing
moment, the flames became even more magnificent as it ate away at
Keridna’s mana.

Then, Lisetta shouted.

“Gahhhhhh!!!”

「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Ddddddddddddd───!!*

*Kuuuuuuuuuu───!!*

Lisetta swung her bat sideways at the magic circle, triggering the magic
and causing boulders of topaz to ferociously blaze through the air.

The magical blunt weapon, ‘Rock Bat’. The bat, which increased the power
of rock magic, increased the power of \[Rock Avalanche\] dramatically.
It was a weapon that made the use of mana more difficult, but that
wasn’t a problem for Lisetta, who had practiced with *Rock Bat* for many
years.

The magic boulder, densely packed with rock mana, headed straight
towards Isaac.

Isaac already held the dagger and the *Sheath of Disaster* with his
index and middle fingers, while his remaining fingers were interlocked
to condense ice mana. He was willing to use the *Sheath of Disaster* to
unleash two consecutive \[Frost Explosion\]’s in order to counter
Lisetta’s magic.

*Roarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr──────!*

At that moment, Keridna swung her wand downwards, and as a result, the
\[Fire Dragon\] that had grown to an impossibly large size plummeted
towards Isaac, Luce, and Ciel. A long whirlwind with torrents of
spiraled flames threatened to engulf them.

Tristan’s men and the Class B top students also launched counterattacks
with various elemental spells.

「Water Flow Barrier (Water Element, ★6)」

Then, a clear blue shield of water formed around Issac like the blue
sky. It was a shield that nullified Luce’s water magic.

At the same time, a magnificent blue magic circle instantly materialized
on the ground.

Afterwards, a humpback whale leaped out from the magic circle.

「Flying Whale (Water Element, ★6)」

*Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ──────!!!!!*

*Kuwa-aaaaaaaaaa ──────!!!*

The giant whale devoured all of the enemy’s magic. More accurately, It
was a terrifyingly fierce spectacle of condensed tidal current that took
the form of a whale. It surged with overwhelming force.

If they were swept into the whale’s body, they would be crushed by the
intense water pressure and hurled around inside the whale’s body at
breakneck speed.

\[Flying Whale\] was triggered under Isaac’s feet.

Thanks to \[Water Flow Barrier\], he was shielded from Luce’s attack. It
was a magic that negated the caster’s own magic.

The water-made whale destroyed half of the building that came into
contact with its body.

The wreckage of the building was swept away by the whale’s torrent.

The building Tristan and his men took shelter in collapsed. The
water-made whale seemed to have swallowed them whole and even drowned
out their screams.

Soon after, \[Flying Whale\] and \[Fire Dragon\] clashed. However, the
\[Fire Dragon\] was uselessly devoured by the whale’s body, only to
explode into a burst of hot steam.

Lisetta’s \[Rock Avalanche\] was swept away by the torrent and swirled
around inside the whale’s body. It was not much different from the fate
of the half-destroyed buildings.

***Truly overwhelming.*** In front of Luce, the first-year students’
magic was meaningless.

“It’s scary, really…”

Isaac unleashed the spell for \[Frost Explosion\] in admiration and
continued to run.

The moment \[Flying Whale\] turned into blue powder and dispersed, Isaac
caught sight of Lisetta, who had deployed a magic circle aimed right at
him.

“I won’t miss!!”

With her bat raised, Lisetta smashed the magic circle.

「Rockfall (Rock Element, ★4)」

Isaac noticed that a shadow had been cast all around him. When he lifted
his head, he saw a large topaz-coloured rock menacingly fall from the
sky. It appeared to be from a light brown magic circle that was carved
into the sky above.

Ciel and Luce tried to block the attack by deploying a \[Water Wall\]…

…When suddenly, an unexpected gust of wind came crashing down onto the
\[Rockfall\].

「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」

A light green whirlwind of great power, incomparable to that of
Tristan’s magic, sliced through the air.

It swallowed the \[Rockfall\] that was headed towards Isaac in an
instant.

That \[Whirlwind\] boasted a high enough mana density to blow Lisetta’s
\[Rockfall\] away.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

An unnatural wind began to flow around the area. The wind gained
momentum in a matter of seconds as it ferociously ruffled the hair and
uniforms of the nearby students.

And then, a girl descended from the sky, her light green pigtails
fluttering around.

*Whoooooooooooo──*

She landed lightly on the ground, with wind at her feet.

Kaya Astrean stepped in between Isaac and Lisetta.

“Kaya…?”

\* \* \*

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 96

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to help you.\]

The moment I saw Kaya’s back, I couldn’t help but stop in my tracks. It
was because I could see her clutch her rib cage in pain.

“Hahahaha, even the second seat is participating! Who the hell is this
extra that you bitches are making such a fuss over, ang?!!”

Lisetta excitedly shouted as she looked from the top seat to the second,
and third.

Her voice, however, did not seem to have reached Kaya.

“Go ahead, Sir Isaac. I don’t know what you have in mind this time, but…
I will always be on your side no matter what.”

Kaya’s low voice had a faint tremor, as if she had just been crying.

It bothered me, but now wasn’t the time to think about it. Time was
running out. I thanked her and started to run towards the submission
location once again.

And then.

“You…?”

“Luce Eltania!”

Kaya furiously shouted at the top of her lungs. It was the
rose-gold-haired top seat who reacted to her.

Kaya’s gaze snapped towards Luce. An angry side profile caught my eye.

Luce had an apathetic expression on her face as she looked at Kaya. She
appeared to have judged that because Kaya protected me, she was not an
enemy.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Feels a strong inferiority complex to
Luce Eltania.\]

If there was someone who could put Kaya in such a state, the only person
who came to mind was Luce. She appeared to have narrowly avoided
elimination, but her battle with Luce seemed to have stimulated
something deep inside of her.

Lisetta and Keridna were stunned, as this was the first time they had
ever seen the diligent Kaya raise her voice.

“Kaya Astrean! My name is Kaya Astrean!! I am the one who has been
chasing you to the brink of death, I’ve always been right behind you!!
But you!! You don’t even remember me…!”

Kaya’s sincerity echoed throughout her tearful voice.

“I hate you!”

The hand holding her wand started to tremble.

The inferiority complex she’d been harboring towards the top seat had
been building up and finally erupted. Kaya was clearly shaken by her
fight with Luce.

That inferiority complex of hers wouldn’t get any better in the future.
The gap between Luce and Kaya would widen over time. The only thing that
awaited Kaya was a deep sense of self-doubt.

“I… I can’t help but think that I can only receive this kind of
treatment from you, and it makes me feel pathetic…! That I’m… I’m… so…
weak… in your eyes!”

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

I created a wall of ice around Kaya, so that the other students wouldn’t
see her cry.

By the time I regained my senses, my feet had already moved towards
Kaya.

I pulled Kaya into a hug from behind and took out a wand from the magic
pouch in my arms, softly placing it in her hand. A wand made of
‘Armana’, an 8-star colossal tree that guarded the Great Forest.

It was the only wand that synergized with plant mana, and it was Kaya’s
final weapon that would boost her abilities to new heights.

***This is my gift, from me to you.***

“I thought I told you before.”

Besides her tears, Kaya’s tremors had ceased, as if time had stood
still.

Over the course of my countless playthroughs of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, I had grown attached to the characters.

Kaya Astrean, in particular, was one of the official heroines. It goes
without saying that I had a lot of affection for her.

Maybe that was why… the sight of Kaya’s tears made me feel sick to my
stomach. I couldn’t help but reach out to her.

“Your true worth will be shown in the future.”

“Sir… Isaac…?”

Kaya had previously mistaken me for a super strong person. She even
admired me.

In reality, I was just a weak man, but my current false self held
tremendous influence over Kaya.

I wanted to use that to give her the best comfort I could offer. I hoped
she would be able to draw strength from it.

So I whispered in her ear in a calm voice.

“Don’t forget. You’re someone I recognize.”

With those words, I pulled away from Kaya, released the \[Ice Wall\],
and started to run again.

The students looked back and forth between Kaya and I with confused
expressions. They seemed to be curious about what kind of short
conversation had taken place inside the \[Ice Wall\].

It was Kaya who was the most flustered. Her tears had long since dried
up, and her eyes were fixed on the Armana Wand I had given her.

Soon, Kaya’s face was flushed red, and steam began to rise from her
head.

…I had momentarily forgotten that Kaya was weak to men.

“Running away again, you coward!!”

Lisetta’s boulder tried to fly towards me once more.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

Kaya’s wind, now stronger than ever, shot out dozens of meters like a
sharp sword, easily slicing through Lisetta’s boulder.

Lisetta’s pupils dilated.

It was a boulder that had been imbued with the power of Rock Bat. The
sight of such magic being easily destroyed by wind magic shocked Lisetta
to her core.

“…?”

Kaya herself appeared to be surprised, and rightfully so. The mere act
of holding the Wand of Armana had greatly boosted her elemental magic
and combat power.

***With this, my debt to you is settled, Kaya.***

I turned my back on the battlefield, where all kinds of elemental magic
and screams rang out, and ran towards the submission location.

The time for the *Thunderbird Subjugation* was nearly upon us.

Chapter 43: - Thunderbird Subjugation (1)
=========================================

༺ **Thunderbird Subjugation (1)**༻

Isaac was a bit of a celebrity within the Magic Department. In a bad
way, of course.

He was in Class D with Grade E mana. In the class placement evaluation,
he took last place with a score that would have been difficult to
achieve even if he deliberately tried, and he was ranked at the bottom
of the bottom among the first-years of the Magic Department.

He was, without a doubt, the weakest student of the Magic Department.

But now, things were different. If you stopped any student and asked
them if Isaac was the weakest first-year, they would shake their heads.

During the duel evaluation, he used 5-star magic, albeit at a low level.
Among the first-year students of the Magic Department, there were only a
handful of students who could use 5-star magic. Isaac, who was thought
to be the weakest, had done it.

It was an incredible growth rate.

Even so, it didn’t prove that Isaac was special. If anything, Ian
Fairytale, who was also evaluated as having Grade E mana during the mana
evaluation, was special. His growth rate was much faster, and he even
had a constitution that allowed him to use the light element.

In addition, some students were already at a level where they could use
5-star magic at a high level.

This naturally overshadowed the fruits of Isaac’s hard work, as people’s
attention was drawn to those who were more impressive.

However…

‘That man… Not only was he involved with the top seat and senior
Dorothy, but also the second and third seats…?’

Eva Heilov couldn’t believe her eyes.

She was watching a large-scale battle while she secretly hid behind a
tree in \[Stealth\] mode. From the looks of it, it seemed that Luce
Eltania was very upset over Isaac’s injury.

During the battle, even Kaya Astrean, the second seat, joined in and
took Isaac’s side.

And to Eva’s surprise, even Ciel Cardenas, who had helped Isaac find his
Fell Cards, was on Isaac’s side.

‘Isaac, who the hell are you…?’

Eva wondered in fear. The thought that all the strongest students of the
Magic Department were favoring Isaac was terrifying. What kind of
fearsome man was he?

“Kyaaak!”

Suddenly, Luce’s water magic sliced through the trees around Eva. It was
something that had been misfired in the middle of the large battle.

Eva trembled, covering her head with both hands, like when someone was
caught in a crossfire between two sides.

\* \* \*

“Isaac. Pass.”

The submission location was a small passageway whose entrance was
adjacent to the barrier for the exam. I was greeted by a young female
professor in charge of Class C who was on standby there.

I handed the 5 Fell Cards to the female professor as I caught my breath.
She checked them all, nodded, and unlocked my bracelet.

When she inserted something that looked like a key into it, it clicked
and unlocked.

“I didn’t expect you to beat out all those Class A students and get
first place. *Hoho*, you must have had some tricks up your sleeve. You
seem like a guy who’s good at taking the easy way out.”

I had already anticipated that I would be doubted over how someone like
me could come in first place, and I had already thought about it a lot.
But the female professor’s meek attitude still made me discouraged.

“If you walk out of here and go straight ahead, you’ll see a carriage.
If you ride it, you can go back to your dormitory. Great job.”

“Thank you.”

I lowered my head and bowed, then walked out of the passage.

***My suffering doesn’t end here.***

I was barely at the starting line.

The sun was still shining in the sky. As soon as the setting sun
disappeared over the horizon, the Thunderbird^1^The Thunderbird is a
legendary creature, in particular, North American indigenous peoples’
history and culture. It is considered a supernatural being of power and
strength. would be summoned.

Until then, I have to go around the outskirts, just outside the boundary
of the end-of-semester evaluation. I headed towards the building called
Carly Hall, which sat high on a hill.

I took off at full speed, using the calf muscles I had worked so hard
on.

*❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird Subjugation」*

Just as the sun was setting, Vera the Summoner rode on her familiar and
flew towards the exam location like a speeding bullet.

As soon as the demon appeared, she immediately stole Thunderbird Galia
from Luce, which caused her to lose all of her mana and faint.

Afterwards, Vera stormed into the exam location to kill the main
character, Ian Fairytale. Because of this, the academy was forced to
declare a state of emergency.

Subsequently, the old Märchen Academy was surrounded by the barrier of
the mighty Thunderbird. As a result, the academy’s administration was
unable to help. Anyone who approached would be electrocuted by the
high-voltage current, and it would be difficult to break through the
barrier.

Meanwhile, Vera the Summoner decided to go to ‘Carly Hall’ with
Thunderbird Galia and Luce in order to observe the situation.

The inside of the Thunderbird’s barrier was infested with the
Thunderbird’s minions called ‘Lightning Harpies’. These mobs would give
exp when you defeated them.

Luce’s unconscious body was protected by the Thunderbird’s lightning
shield, which made her the safest person in the *Thunderbird
Subjugation.*

Confused by the unexpected disaster, the exam proctors, professors, and
the students with strength remaining tried to locate the rest of the
students, and carry out a rescue operation.

This process was carried out quickly and without any casualties. The
bracelets worn on the students’ wrists made it easy to locate them, and
the Lightning Harpies were no match for the exam proctors and
professors.

By the way, those who passed the test before the appearance of the
Thunderbird were safe, since the Thunderbird’s barrier was only set up
to the entrance of the exam site. Even if you had stayed at the
entrance, you wouldn’t have to worry, since the professors would
evacuate you to a safe place immediately.

Ultimately.

The story of Act 3 Scene 4 was about the remaining students, professors,
and exam proctors joining forces to defeat Vera and the Thunderbird. The
leaders would inevitably be Ian and Dorothy, who are the only ones who
could deliver an effective blow to the Thunderbird.

‘So, what I need to do is…’

Go to Carly Hall in advance and hide, and wait for the optimal time to
kill Vera the Summoner.

There were two important points in this mission.

First. That I shouldn’t kill Vera the Summoner in advance.

The Thunderbird was consumed by destructive instincts due to the curse
of the 8-star magic beast, Evil Dragon Orchis. Because of that, they
couldn’t control themselves, and Luce had to pour out her lightning mana
every second to suppress the Thunderbird.

Vera’s domination magic, on the other hand, could even consume the curse
of the Evil Dragon to gain complete control. As a result, if Vera was
defeated, the Thunderbird would return to normal. It was also important
to note that Luce regained her original powers, which was crucial for
future scenarios.

Second, Vera must be alone. Just as the Thunderbird Subjugation party
was slaying the Lightning Harpies and about to reach Carly Hall, the
Thunderbird stops them. This meant Vera would be by herself.

‘That’s when I come into play.’

This was Plan A, the most likely way for our *SSS-Class Master Fainter
Protagonist* to not die.

There was no need to worry about anyone dying in the process of
defeating the Lightning Harpies as long as Dorothy was there. The
problem was Thunderbird Galia.

As the subjugation party dealt with the Thunderbird, it would unleash
the 7-star lightning spell \[Thunderstorm Annihilation\] when its HP
dropped to 20%. It was a spell that poured out massive amounts of
lightning, insta-killing anyone who wasn’t Dorothy.

In order to stop \[Thunderstorm Annihilation\], all the purple magic
stones on the Thunderbird’s body must be struck by a single light
elemental sword, which was easier said than done. That was why I have
repeatedly stated that the Thunderbird Subjugation was extremely
difficult.

In other words, there was no way the protagonist would be able to stop
\[Thunderstorm Annihilation\].

Therefore, it would be safer for me to participate in the Thunderbird
Subjugation battle, even at the risk of my identity being revealed.

Plan A, which was to quickly take down Vera the Summoner before Galia’s
HP dropped to 20% was the safest way. Both for preventing bad endings
and for the future.

As a secondary note, defeating familiars wouldn’t give experience
points.

However, if I killed Vera, the subjugation party that fought against
Thunderbird Galia would be treated as if they had fought Vera and would
receive cooperative experience points.

Ian, in particular, must be as powerful as he needs to be to progress
the story. ***Let’s hope he gains good party exp.***

“Gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp…!”

My breathing became heavy, but I couldn’t stop. Because the sky was
slowly darkening.

\* \* \*

The outcome of the End-of-Semester Evaluation battle was obvious from
the start. With the top, second, and third seats of the Magic Department
on the same team, no one at the exam site stood a chance against them.

When the dust settled, only Luce, Kaya, and Ciel were left standing
amidst the fierce battlefield. Their enemies had all been knocked out,
left sprawled on the ground as the exam proctors gradually gathered them
with stretchers.

“Sir Isaac…”

The wand in Kaya’s hand was the one Isaac had given her earlier. Its
body, made of beautiful grayish-brown wood, was studded with magic
stones that gave off a brilliant rust color.

The wand’s mana sensitivity was far different from her usual wand. It
felt as if clogged mana circuits had been unblocked, which allowed her
to channel even more mana.

“Your share.”

Luce quietly approached Kaya and handed her two Fell Cards. Given that
they had taken all the students’ Fell Cards in the large-scale battle,
they must have some leftovers.

As she received the cards, Kaya’s mind was filled with a slew of
emotions. The anguish and humiliation she’d felt earlier when she
realized she was nothing to Luce, as well as the thrill and relief she’d
felt when she heard Isaac’s whispers, were all entangled in a complex
web of thoughts.

But Kaya shook her head and pushed aside all these musings.

She had lost, and Luce had won, it was as simple as that. Whether the
winner remembered the loser or not was up to her own discretion.

Moreover, she was someone who was acknowledged by Sir Isaac. There was
no reason for her to feel down.

“Thank you, Luce Eltania.”

Kaya flashed a gentle smile and took the cards from Luce.

Luce narrowed her eyes.

She claimed she was the second seat. Even when she ran into the spell in
the blue rose garden, and when she first appeared here, she had an
expression full of anger, but now she looked strangely relaxed.

What did she and Isaac talk about in that brief moment inside of the
\[Ice Wall\] that caused her attitude to change so suddenly?

Luce’s eyes turned to Kaya’s hand.

Kaya’s wand had changed, she had noticed it a while ago. It had to be a
gift from Isaac.

‘Was she also Isaac’s friend…?’

At that moment, Luce realized something she had overlooked.

For her, Isaac was her first friend. But she couldn’t have been Isaac’s
first friend. He must have built up countless human relationships.

It wouldn’t be surprising if the girl with the light green twin tails in
front of her was one of them.

“…”

She felt her heart ache. It was a fact that subtly irritated her.

She was already dissatisfied with the amount of time she spent with
Isaac, and if he had many friends as well…. wouldn’t the already
insufficient amount of time become even more scarce?

As Luce came to such a conclusion, she began to feel a deep repulsion
towards Kaya.

She knew it was her own selfishness and childish thinking, but she
wanted to monopolize Isaac’s time. He was her only friend. And being
with him was really enjoyable.

“Tsk.”

Luce clicked her tongue as she handed Kaya the cards, then quickly
turned around and left the scene.

As Luce walked away, Kaya stared blankly at her back.

‘Did she just get annoyed? Why?’

She honestly couldn’t figure out what the top seat was thinking.

──It was then that the demon appeared with her back to the setting sun.

\[Good morning, everyone!!!\]

The gazes of the students and the test proctors immediately turned to
the three-meter tall woman.

The gray-skinned demon, Vera the Summoner. A creepy smile tugged at the
corners of her lips.

\* \* \*

My whole body was drenched in sweat. The school uniform I was wearing
felt heavy.

However, I was able to run at full speed for quite a long time, perhaps
thanks to the development of my stamina.

Throughout the run, I kept an eye on the scoreboard in the sky. It was
difficult to make an accurate judgment, but it seemed that about
thirteen people had passed the exam. This was all while the first,
second, and third seats were in the midst of a fierce battle.

My destination, Carly Hall, was located at the top of a high hill.

The red palace-like exterior still exuded a beautiful grandeur, along
with the traces of the passage of time. Along with Bartos Hall, it was a
building that symbolized Märchen Academy.

A hill covered with colorful flowers appeared before my eyes. Without
resting, I ran up the hill.

But as I reached the middle of the hill while running.

*Kuooooohhh────!!*

*Kuwaaaaaa────!!*

“…!”

A deafening screech rang out. I stopped in my tracks and immediately
turned my head back.

The setting sun was disappearing beyond the horizon as twilight slowly
crept down.

**───────── \[Kiaaaaaaahhhh───!!!!!\]**

*Krrrrr──────!!*

*Clang-clang-clang─────!!!*

The loud cry of a bird of prey. The screech of the Thunderbird rang
throughout heaven and earth, and thunder rose from all directions.

Dozens of purple lightning bolts streaked across the sky, each carving
its own shape into the ultramarine blue sky.

In an instant, dark clouds covered the sky.

From a location where you could capture the panoramic view of the old
Märchen Academy with a single glance, a black Thunderbird entwined with
purple lightning and darkness mana soared into the sky.

A massive creature appeared, and despite the distance between us, it
felt as if it was right in front of me.

It was the 8-star magic beast that could destroy a country, ‘Thunderbird
– Galia’.

\[Thunderbird – Galia\] **Lv:** 175

**Race:** (Demon)

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** Highest

Chapter 44: - Thunderbird Subjugation (2)
=========================================

༺ **Thunderbird Subjugation (2)**༻

Thunderbird Galia flashed a red glare from its eyes while wrapping
purple lighting mana around its massive wings.

It was trying to cast a barrier. There was no doubt that the Thunderbird
had exchanged spells with Dorothy just moments ago. Dorothy must have
strategically retreated with the students.

In an instant, a thunderstorm condensed around Galia.

Then, when the large amount of lightning mana had gathered, it formed a
dense mass that was incredibly small.

──────── \[───────!!!!!\]

Lightning mana erupted with the roar of the Thunderbird, and swept
across the old Märchen Academy grounds in the blink of an eye.

「Thunder God’s Barrier (Lightning Element, ★7 )」

*Kaaaaaahhhhh──────!!!*

*Pajijijijijijik──────!!*

“Uwak!”

A violent gust of wind blew me away, which caused me to roll down the
hill. For a brief moment, I felt a tingling sensation spread throughout
my entire body.

Some buildings were smashed to pieces, and trees were uprooted and
toppled.

Lightning strikes flashed countless times. The lightning mana spread out
by the Thunderbird had transformed into a wide barrier.

With a jolt, a powerful purple barrier was formed from a large amount of
lightning mana. This generated a large amount of high-voltage currents.

\[Thunder God’s Barrier\].

The stage was set for the final part of the first semester of the first
year of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird
Subjugation」.

*Booom────!!*

*Booom────!!*

*Booom────!!*

At the same time, countless lightning bolts struck multiple places
across the grounds of the old Märchen Academy, and the Thunderbird’s
minions, the ‘Lightning Harpies’, emerged from them.

A particularly intense lightning bolt struck the side of Carly Hall, and
a large number of Lighting Harpies were concentrated there – this was
because Vera the Summoner had marked Carly Hall.

“Argh…!”

***How many times have I rolled today? Seriously.***

I grumbled and quickly rose from the ground, resuming my run up the
hill.

The \[Thunder God’s Barrier\] was impenetrable. This was due to the
effect of \[Nest\], a unique trait of Thunderbird Galia, which caused a
large amount of lightning mana to form a dense and solid barrier.

If I had to estimate the level of the spell itself, I would say it was
around level 190.

So even if all of the academy’s staff, including Dorothy, fired spells
at it all at once, it wouldn’t produce any meaningful results. They
would come to realize this later when they tested their spells against
the barrier together.

**───\[Kiaaaaaahhhh─────!!\]**

The entrance to the palace-like Carly Hall was shattered, and Lightning
Harpies busted out. Lightning Harpies were winged humanoid creatures
whose entire bodies were composed of lightning mana.

\[Lightning Harpy\] **Lv:** 85

**Race:** (Demon)

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** Medium

**Psychology:** \[Wants to kill humans.\]

I arrived at Carly Hall just in time.

‘Thank you for opening the door, my sweet EXP!’

\[The demons have been recognized as enemies.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\] 「Frostfire (Ice
Element, ★4)」

*Hwaaaaaaaaak───────!!*

My entire body became as light as a feather. My exhausted body went
beyond being recovered and started to overflow with power. I felt as if
I could shatter a building with a single punch. The flow of the mana
within my mana circuit accelerated and the quality of my mana
fundamentally changed.

The unique trait \[Hunter\] had activated.

I slaughtered the Lightning Harpies with a blast of cold blue flames of
unparalleled power as I continued briskly moving my feet.

After I entered Carly Hall, I found myself in a wide central corridor. A
swarm of Lightning Harpies glared at me in unison.

The top floor of this building was where Vera the Summoner would bring
Luce.

Therefore, that was my destination as well.

Kiaaaaaaahhh!!!─────!!

“Yeah, mobs.”

I ran up the central stairs three steps at a time and burnt the
Lightning Harpies with \[Frostfire\].

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 58!\] \[You have gained an
additional 2 stat points!\]

The Lightning Harpies were a good source of EXP. *I’m sorry Ian, but the
Carly Hall free EXP is mine.^1^T/N: Originally the word was honey pot,
which is used in a way to mean ‘this is so easy’ or ‘this is so free’.*

“Phew…”

I finally made it to the top floor, which was lined with statues of
wizards and knights. Although they showed signs of aging, their designs
were still magnificent.

At the end of a red-carpeted room stood a grand altar.

With its high ceilings, the view from the top floor of Carly Hall was
magnificent, the scenery was even comparable to that of a breathtaking
cathedral.

I wiped the beads of sweat that trickled down my forehead and cast a
glance out the window.

The Thunderbird flapped its wings in a spectacle of overwhelming power.
It slowly made its way towards my location, accompanied by Luce and Vera
the Summoner.

They would soon destroy the top floor’s roof and come in. Luckily
enough, they wouldn’t go out of their way to look for the traces of the
Lightning Harpies I killed.

I fought cautiously because I didn’t want them to find any traces of
magic outside Carly Hall.

“Eden.”

As light brown mana gathered in front of me, it took the form of Eden,
my small golem familiar.

\[Kyuuu!\]

“Run away.”

\[Kyuu…?\]

Vera the Summoner could steal her opponent’s Familiar at will. However,
I could avoid the disaster of Eden being taken away from me by getting
rid of him ahead of time.

Eden tilted his head in confusion, perhaps wondering about my
intentions. After I urged him to quickly leave Carly Hall, Eden nodded
his head with a puzzled expression and trudged out.

This simple action ensured that Vera wouldn’t be able to steal my
Familiar, a fate that had befallen many because they were unaware of
this tactic.

Now, I just had to hide according to my plan.

*Tap, tap, tap─*

Fortunately, I knew the perfect place to hide. I started knocking on
several places behind the walls of the altar.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, once the Thunderbird Subjugation was over,
one would be able to enter a secret location within Carly Hall. My plan
was to hide in that secret location.

The game depicted it as something that could be found when one knocked
on a certain place along the wall.

***I must be close to it by now…***

*Tap, tap, tap─*

*Thud, thud.*

‘It’s here.’

It sounded hollow on the inside. I checked the pattern on the wall and
found the location of the handle.

I put my right hand near the handle and faintly channeled my mana
through it.

Then, it slowly absorbed mana from my hand to the inside of the wall. It
felt like being on the shore of a calm lake.

And just like that, I was inside the wall.

The first thing I noticed inside the inner room were the luminescent
stones that lined the walls, emitting a faint light.

My gaze was immediately drawn towards a cramped and run-down study. It
was filled with bookshelves stacked high with books. It was a cramped,
stuffy space.

At the far end of the room stood a miniature-sized desk with a dusty
book on top of it.

It was nothing special, just a book with a setting from ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱. It contained hints related to the Archwizards of each element.
There was nothing worth reading. To begin with, I didn’t even have
enough time to look.

\[A demon has been detected nearby.\]

*Huiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii─*

\[Demon Detection\] had activated. Vera the Summoner was nearby.

I felt an intense aura from beyond the wall.

\[Vera the Summoner\] **Lv:** 125

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Lightning

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Rejoicing at the thought of having obtained the
strongest familiar.\]

I put my ear against the wall to understand the situation.

*─────Kwaaaaang──!!*

I heard the ceiling collapse. The outer walls and ceiling had been
shattered to accommodate the Thunderbird’s gigantic body.

By now, the Thunderbird Subjugation party should have been formed with
Ian Fairytale, a light element wielder who could deliver a devastating
blow to the Thunderbird and the strongest powerhouse of Märchen Academy,
Dorothy Heartnova, at its core.

For reference, the Thunderbird Subjugation party wasn’t easy to create.
The main reason for that was because the ‘Let’s wait for the academy’s
administration’ camp and the ‘Let’s go on the offensive’ camp were at
odds with one another.

As a result, the first-year students stepped forward to fight, in a
scene straight out of a shounen manga, and so the Thunderbird
Subjugation team was formed. I remember feeling a rush of excitement as
I watched that scene.

‘If there’s a variable, it’s the honor students.’

Originally, it was normal for the honor students to have passed the
end-of-semester evaluation before the Thunderbird Subjugation took
place.

For example, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. After Kaya got her 3rd Fell
Card, she managed to get a feel for mana perception, which allowed her
to easily find the 2 other Fell Cards.

Since she passed her exam like that, she didn’t play much of a role in
the Thunderbird Subjugation. The same went for other Class A students
and the Class B honor students.

But this time, it was different.

Due to Luce’s rampage and me being the focus of a fierce battle, the
Class A students and the top ranked honor students from Class B couldn’t
pass the exam before the Thunderbird appeared.

It was a fact that could be inferred by the scoreboard as one climbed up
the hill.

As a result, it was highly likely that they were organised as a
full-scale subjugation party. This was because the injured students
joined the subjugation party after being healed by the shelter’s healing
wizards. However, it should be noted that only those who wanted to join
the subjugation team actually participated.

At the very least, Class A’s Kaya and Lisetta would participate
unconditionally. Kaya had a sense of justice to protect people, and
Lisetta had a courageous desire to fight against the Lightning Harpies
and the Thunderbird.

‘I guess you could say this is a favorable variable for me.’

It was safe to say that the subjugation party’s stability had slightly
increased. The support from the helpers would be even stronger than in
the original scenario.

The mission of the Thunderbird Subjugation party was simple. Defeat the
Lightning Harpies and storm Carly Hall.

When the Thunderbird appeared, Dorothy focused on protecting people,
while Ian focused on striking the Thunderbird with a sword attack
enveloped with a light spell.

Lastly, go to Carly Hall and defeat Vera the Summoner. After that, the
mission would be over.

They argued amongst themselves and said that the plan was absurd. At
that moment, Mateo exclaimed, “There is no other way…” and I witnessed
the students’ resolve grow as they said their lines one by one. This was
also one of my favourite scenes.

Of course, only the main lines of the plan were easy to understand, but
the subjugation party still moved systematically after pre-determining
their formation and route. They must have worked together to implement
the strategy in a timely manner in order to minimize casualties.

‘Dorothy is there too, so don’t you dare recklessly charge in and faint,
Ian.’

***I’ll quickly get rid of the crazy bitch and put an end to this
situation.***

***…I should start preparing soon.***

I took out the ‘Magic Cloak of Disguise – Berserker’ from my magic bag
and began to put it on. It was just in case I was ever in a situation
where my identity could be revealed.

\* \* \*

\[Kyahoooooooooooooooo!!\]

On the top floor of Carly Hall, beyond the wall where Isaac was hiding.
Even though the sky was not visible due to the Thunderbird’s barrier, it
was a gloomy evening.

Vera the Summoner, a gray-skinned demon with a height of 3m, twirled
around in circles with her arms outstretched to her sides. Despite the
sloppiness of her dress, her movements were reminiscent of an actress on
a stage.

\[Ah, the best, the best, ah\~. To have the best Familiar in my hands,
I, Vera the Summoner, am very lucky. Ahhh, it’s so cute, cute,
cute!!!!!\]

The ceiling and one of the outer walls were blown in half as the
Thunderbird’s huge body filled the top floor of Carly Hall.

Vera screamed with affection as she stroked Galia. Her eyes were
bloodshot with bulging veins, her voice was raspy, and blood spurted
from her mouth.

\[Kyaaaahhhhh, so cute, so cute! My familiar is so cute, I’m going
crazy…\]

Afterwards, Vera the Summoner scratched her frizzy brown hair like a dog
and hit the horn on her forehead.

She scratched and rubbed the Thunderbird’s cheek with her nails and
palms, which were covered with scraped skin and blood.

The darkness mana that coursed through Thunderbird Galia’s body made it
unable to resist Vera, and it merely shivered. Vera’s absolute
domination familiar-limited magic was so powerful that not even the
powerful Thunderbird could resist.

\[This black bird belongs to me, Vera. My new son\~. It’s such a waste
for someone like you ahhh\~\]

Vera the Summoner hummed her own impromptu song as she gazed up at
Thunderbird Galia’s original master floating above the altar.

A female student with rose gold hair was restrained in a standing
position within a powerful lightning shield made of the Thunderbird’s
mana, she was like a stuffed doll.

She couldn’t move. All of her mana was drained by the Thunderbird, and
all her strength left her body.

She didn’t even have the strength to open her eyes properly, and she
laid limp like a corpse.

\[It’s a wasteeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!\]

Vera the Summoner screamed with her fists clenched, then bared her sharp
teeth and giggled.

\[Heheheheheheheheheh!!! Oh no, the humans are on their way! They’re
coming to save you! They’re coming to save you, to save you, to save
you! But what can they do? My familiar, my black bird, will kill all of
your friends, keeeeekkkk!\]

Within the lightning shield, no answer came out of Luce’s mouth. She
drifted along the far sides of consciousness and reality.

\[Ah, here they come, here they come—!!\]

Vera the Summoner shouted as she looked out of the window.

The subjugation party was charging towards Carly Hall, while enveloped
in a translucent protective shield made of colorful starlight – it was a
group of professors, proctors, and students in their school uniforms.

They had already begun climbing the hill that led to Carly Hall.

\[They’re here, they’re here!! Even the *Child of Light*! They’re
already marching towards the underworld on their own!!\]

Vera, who had been laughing manically while splattering blood, suddenly
stopped and glanced at Thunderbird Galia. There was a change in the
atmosphere, as if she had a sudden change of heart.

Vera’s waist bent grotesquely to the side, and then she commanded
solemnly.

\[Kill them all.\]

Suddenly, the darkness mana that enveloped the Thunderbird surged even
thicker.

The Thunderbird screamed in agony and flashed his red eyes. He spread
his massive wings and soared above the already collapsed ceiling.

──────── \[────Kiyaahhhhhhhhhhhh───!!!!!\]

*Booooom boom boom boom─────!!!*

The lightning barrier responded to the Thunderbird’s roar. With a single
flap of his wings, menacing purple thunderbolts struck in several
directions.

The Thunderbird Subjugation party stopped in their tracks and gasped at
the sight of its imposing presence. A murderous tension settled heavily
in the air.

With a bolt of lightning, the Thunderbird arrived in front of the
subjugation party.

The battle had begun.

\[Hehehehehehe! Oh, everyone’s going to die, they’re going to die, die,
die!\]

Vera the Summoner laughed with an excited voice, stretched her arms out
to the sides, and began to spin around again.

\[Oh, you foolish creatures, you’ve made a stupid choice by trying to
save that ugly woman! Kiyahhhhhhhhh!\]

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaahhhhhhh─────!!*

While Vera the Summoner frantically screamed, she felt a sense of danger
from behind and quickly threw her body to the side.

However, her left arm had already been completely blown off from a brief
blast of ice.

Her frozen arm brought her excruciating pain, causing her to let out a
ear-piercing scream.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

At the same time, the \[Ice Wall\] draped over the shattered outer wall.

Vera instinctively felt danger and quickly bent her knees, then leapt
over the broken outer wall with incredible speed.

Before the \[Ice Wall\] could be fully erected, she barely landed on top
of the building.

\[Owaaaahh…!! What are youuu?!!\]

The ice mass created by the \[Frost Explosion\] and the \[Ice Wall\]
that failed to encapsulate Vera turned into light blue powder that
scattered and disappeared.

A monster appeared in front of Vera’s eyes as it stood before the altar.
It had an unruly appearance with a navy blue hood tightly pulled over
its head. The razor-sharp teeth that were tightly packed in its mouth
were more menacing than those of any beast, and its skin was as pitch
black as ink.

Above the altar was a female student with rose gold hair, protected by a
lightning shield. The monster turned its back on the altar and glared at
Vera the Summoner as if to protect the student.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

The black monster was emitting a pale, chilly aura from its entire body.

His large, round red eyes glowed with a murderous intent.

────────── \[Gahahaahahahaha!!!\]

The monster’s roar shook Carly Hall.

Magic Cloak of Disguise – Berserker. To others, it looked and sounded
like that, regardless of the will of the one who wore it.

Heavy mana flowed like the wind and brushed against Vera’s skin.

When Vera realised what was happening, she shut her loud mouth.

The mana she felt from it surpassed her very own.

\[Hmm.\]

Vera smiled. She had thought of something fun.

\* \* \*

*Chaeeeeeeng─────!!*

*Kuwaaaaaaaaaa─────!!*

──────── \[Kiiiaaaaaahhhhh!!!\]

A multicolored beam of starlight pierced through the Thunderbird’s
shoulder. The light exerted a gravitational force on the parts it
touched, tearing off the flesh and pulling the bones, before exerting a
repulsive force that crushed the Thunderbird’s shoulder.

The power of starlight magic mercilessly tore apart its opponent with
irregular physical force.

The Thunderbird let out a scream and unleashed a barrage of lightning.
The purple magic circle carved in the sky rained down countless
lightning strikes towards the subjugation party.

It was a wide-range attack that could cause fatal injuries with just a
graze.

The Proctor, Dorothy Heartnova, hastily deployed a Starlight Shield to
protect the subjugation party. As soon as the Thunderbirds’s lightning
bolt touched the shield, it was distorted and neutralized.

“Ah, that electric chicken!”

Dorothy was frustrated by her inability to launch a powerful attack at
the Thunderbird. She could have used high-powered spells to her heart’s
content if there was no one in the barrier, but she now had to
prioritize protection.

In the end, Dorothy had no choice but to quickly use Starlight Shield to
protect the subjugation party.

The Thunderbird subjugation party was engaged in a fierce battle against
Thunderbird Galia.

Their goal was to *“win while preserving everyone’s lives”.*

They were able to set such an absurd goal even with an 8-star magic
beast as their enemy because there were two beings who could deal
effective damage to the Thunderbird, and one of them could even create a
powerful Starlight Shield.

However.

“When did he pass out again?! Someone wake him up!”

“Iann!!”

Amy Holloway, the healing wizard of the subjugation party, cried out in
desperation.

Ian Fairytale, a key force capable of using light magic that could
counter the Thunderbird.

At some point, he had passed out with his back leaning against a pile of
rubble.

Chapter 45: - Thunderbird Subjugation (3)
=========================================

**༺ Thunderbird Subjugation (3) ༻**

「Thunderbolt (Lightning Element, ★4)」

*Kwagwang──!!*

I tried to chase after Vera the Summoner when suddenly, a lightning bolt
struck right in front of me. It made me instinctively jump back.

\[Hehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\]

Vera looked at me with bloodshot eyes and let out an eerie laugh.
Despite the fact that she must have realized that she was much weaker
than me.

This was because the true power of Vera the Summoner lied in her ability
to control familiars.

Her strength or weakness wasn’t determined by her own strength, but by
the strength of the familiars she controlled.

Darkness mana rose like thick clouds, spreading out far and wide.

The darkness mana covered the sky like a dense fog, and countless
familiars revealed themselves from within it.

Beyond the collapsed ceiling.

An army of various animal-like familars, their own elemental mana imbued
with darkness mana, filled the sky.

──────── \[Kyahahahahahahahahak──!!!!\]

An evil laughter echoed throughout.

A colossal familiar, large enough to even overwhelm the army, revealed
itself within the massive pool of spherical darkness mana.

A muscular body covered in red armor. Its three pairs of wings were
riddled with bizarre eyeballs, and its face which resembled that of a
sea turtle bore a grotesque smile.

It was Hakil, a 7-star familiar that had become a demon.

\[Hakil\] **Lv:** 140

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to tear your limbs off.\]

\[Hehehehehehehehehehe!!! You cute little things, have you come to
protect your mommy? Neeeee\~\]

Vera the Summoner climbed onto a winged pterodactyl familiar, infused
with darkness mana and light green wind, and flew upwards.

She asked questions and answered them herself as she posed with
exaggerated gestures, as if she was performing in a play.

The winged pterodactyl familiar flapped its wings and spat out blood
from its mouth with a squeaky sound.

\[Splendid, splendid! Our lovely little ones! Let’s subdue that bastard,
chew on their entrails, and carefully separate their limbs! You got all
that? Neeee\~\]

Upon Vera’s command, the horde of familiars roared at me. It was a
sorrowful roar, filled with grief.

The army of familiars, now deeply corrupted by darkness mana, had become
magic beasts of darkness that could never revert back to their original
state, even if Vera were to die. Their resentment spilled out through
their cries.

Hakil laughed wickedly and stretched his arms towards the sky. A huge
purple magic circle trailed just out of reach of the Thunderbird’s
barrier.

At that moment, numerous magic circles of various shapes and colors
dazzled in midair. They were only aimed at me with the sole purpose of
taking me down. It would have been a breathtakingly beautiful sight if
it wasn’t a spell meant to kill me.

*Kwaang──!*

The ground was ripped apart. With a single stomp, cracks appeared on the
top floor of Carly Hall.

I channeled ice mana into my hands and took a battle stance.

Amidst the large-scale magic circles that covered my field of vision.

A lone light blue magic circle emitted light from within the
half-destroyed building.

────────── \[Kyahahahahahahahahaha──!!!!\]

Alongside Hakil’s hearty laughter.

The magic circles of the army of familiars simultaneously unleashed
their spells.

*Whirrrrrrrrrr───────!!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaa───────!!!!*

*Kwagagagagag───────!!!*

*Drrrrrrrrrr────── !!!!*

Dozens of lightning bolts branched out. A storm of fire and ice rushed
towards me, ice spears cut through the air, and rocks attempted to crush
me.

The oncoming elemental spells rained down on me, with nowhere to hide
from it.

Then, all those attacks suddenly stopped, as if time itself had frozen
for a moment.

「Frost Wave (Ice Element, ★6)」

*Sweeeeeee────!!!!*

*Chararararararak─────!!!*

With a single powerful swing of my arm, the magic circle I created
unleashed a fierce wave of cold in an instant.

The pale blue cold gale and thick snow swallowed all the elemental
attacks and spread out in all directions, solidly freezing the army of
familiars.

After they met their futile end, the familiars began to fall vertically.

Their bodies, frozen to the core, shattered helplessly into pieces as
they hit the ground, the sound of glass shattering echoed.

\[Ha-haaaaa…?\]

Vera, riding her pterodactyl familiar from far away, had a horrified
expression on her face.

The 7-star familiar, Hakil, appeared to be unaffected by the \[Frost
Wave\] I had cast from a distance. He seemed to have high elemental
resistance.

I bent my knees and gave strength to my legs. Then, I kicked off the
ground and leaped towards Hakil with all my might.

*Kuuuuuuung───!!*

My body fiercely cut through the air with the sound of a cannon firing.

For a brief moment, only the sound of my hood flapping vigorously echoed
through my ears.

In an instant, I reached Hakil and grabbed him by the nape of his neck.

───────── \[Kyaaaaaack!!!!\]

───────── \[Choooooooke!!!!\]

Hakil’s scream intersected with my Berserker’s roar.

In order to shake me off, Hakil writhed his body, and engraved purple
magic circles all around us.

His magic circles followed his left hand, he then aimed at me.

「Thunderclap (Lightning Element, ★5)」

*Fzzzzzzzz───!!*

*Kwakakakag────!!!!!*

The magic circles aimed at me simultaneously fired spherical lightning
bolts.

With a thunderous roar, dozens of purple currents branched out, which
threatened to electrocute my body.

They tried to fry me with the extreme heat they generated.

Despite being struck by the powerful and destructive \[Thunderclap\].

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★2)」

The basic elemental spell, \[Ice Barrier\], was enough to protect my
body.

Ice created with an ice spell is unable to conduct electricity when
struck by a lightning spell. Thus, one must solely rely on brute force
to penetrate ice magic with lightning magic.

On top of that, I was wearing the ‘Elemental Bracelet’. To prepare for
Act 3, Scene 4 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had increased my
lightning elemental resistance.

Furthermore, my basic elemental resistance for lightning was especially
high. Not to mention, I was 18 levels higher than Hakil.

His attack felt like a slight static shock at most.

“It’s my turn now.” (Grrrrrrrooooo─!)

I channeled ice mana into my right hand and condensed it. Soon, a light
blue magic circle materialized in front of me.

Hakil struggled violently, trying to shake me off, but the more he
resisted, the tighter I clenched his throat with the intention to tear
it out.

Just like that, I unleashed the condensed ice mana at him.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa──────────────!!!*

────── \[Kyaaaaaaack!!!!\]

An explosion of ice erupted.

The explosion of mana shredded Hakil’s insides, and the ice surged in an
instant, freezing his battered body.

I dispersed the ice, and a massive amount of light blue powder scattered
into the air.

Alhough Hakil’s mangled body leaked purple blood, he still screamed and
resisted.

Once more.

I condensed ice mana into my right hand again. The magic circle for
\[Frost Explosion\] appeared before me.

I unleashed the mana towards Hakil.

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa──────────────!!!*

────────── \[Kyaaaaaaack───!!!!\]

The light blue ice rampaged and completely obliterated Hakil’s body.

A huge ice formation extended from his body, and cut through the air.
Hakil struggled to maintain his balance and started falling straight
down.

I dispersed the ice and fiercely threw my right fist towards him.

*Boom───!!!*

My fist, much smaller compared to Hakil, buried itself into his sea
turtle-like head, and distorted his face.

The eerie sound of breaking armor and a skull being crushed was heard.

The air pressure spread out, and the sound of the punch resounded
loudly. The light blue powder from the ice dissipated, and circular
shock waves formed in the air.

By then, Hakil was already falling to the ground at a terrifying rate.

*Whooooosh───!!*

*Kwaaaaang───!!!*

Hakil’s massive body fell with a violent crash.

Plunged into the ground, he destroyed half of Carly Hall.

Dust swirled like a storm, but it couldn’t hide Hakil’s enormous body.

He laid there with half his head caved in, covered in blood. He could no
longer muster the strength to futilely resist me.

\[My children…!! Aaaaaaaaa…, Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!! My babies, my
babiesaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!\]

Vera cried out in anguish. She was heartbroken at the sight of her
familiars dying so gruesomely. Her mental anguish stemmed from her
possessiveness.

Now, there was nothing left to protect her.

As my body slowly fell under the influence of gravity.

I wrapped my hands in an icy flame and imbued it with \[Black Ice\]
before I directed it at Vera.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Winter Hellfire (Ice Element)」

*Haaaaaaaaaaaaak──────!!!*

The dark blue icy flame spread out, and covered an area large enough to
engulf the entire academy grounds.

It dispersed on such a large scale that Vera couldn’t avoid it.

Soon, between the gaps of the icy flame, I saw Vera and her pterodactyl
familiar fall to the ground while engulfed in flames.

I extinguished the flame and let my body fall to the ground,
surrendering myself to gravity.

*Thud─────!*

I landed on the top floor of Carly Hall, now barely recognizable as a
building. In front of me, Vera and her pterodactyl familiar writhed on
the ground like trampled earthworms.

Their entire bodies were frozen stiff due to the deep chill that
penetrated their very bones. They trembled as if they were victims who
wandered through a snowy mountain ravaged by a blizzard, and then
collapsed.

Vera the Summoner was vulnerable without her familiars.

\[My babies, my babies… Ah, aaaaaaaah…! Dead, deaaaaaaad, sob,
deaaaaaad… Dead, dead…\]

Vera frantically clawed at the ground and bitterly wept like a parent
who had lost her child.

Now it was over. I approached Vera to finish her off.

──At that moment.

A dense shield of lightning enveloped the demon.

─────────────── \[Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa───!!\]

“……!!!”

The screech of a bird of prey.

My heart sank. I hurriedly deployed a thick\[Ice Wall\].

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」 「Chain Lightning (Lightning Element,
★5)」

*Fzzzzzzzzt────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaang─────!!!!*

“Ugh!” (Gereuk!)

A flash of light.

Thick lightning struck me like a chain, it twisted and turned in order
to ambush me.

The \[Chain Lightning\] destroyed the \[Ice Wall\] with sheer
destructive power and completely engulfed my body.

The intense current coursed through my entire body.

I lost consciousness for a moment as my insides burned with pain.

One second. That was how long it took for me to regain consciousness.

I smelled burnt flesh. It was my own. Smoke billowed like mist from my
scorched skin.

“Ah, crazy.”

My hood and part of my mask had been burnt off by the lightning. As soon
as I realized that my Berserker disguise had been compromised, I took
off the suffocating hood.

I should have been in unbearable pain, but thanks to the effect of
\[Hunter\], my body had transcended humanity and I only felt as if I had
entered a sauna.

Thanks to the \[Ice Wall\] that served as a barrier, it broke the
momentum of the lightning.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★1)」

I released a faint cold air to cool my body.

I caught a glimpse of the black Thunderbird, Galia, draped in darkness
mana and purple lightning mana, flying toward me.

*Chararara, chararara────!!!*

*─────Urrrrrrr─────Bang! Bang! Bang!─────!!!!!!*

A cluster of colorful stars emitted light and protected the subjugation
party from the dozens of lightning bolts that struck down from under the
purple \[Thunder God’s Barrier\]. The Thunderbird’s lightning spell was
meant to prevent Dorothy from finding the opportunity to perform such an
attack.

In the distance, I could see the subjugation party being protected by a
shining barrier. The Thunderbird’s magic could attack the subjugation
party from anywhere. Dorothy couldn’t recklessly chase the Thunderbird.

Her best option was to protect the subjugation party with a barrier
while she chased the Thunderbird down the hill.

But now, the Thunderbird was spreading its massive wings at me, blocking
the sky.

\[ Thunderbird-Galia \] **Lv:** 175

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** Highest

**Psychology:** \[ I will kill you. Kill you. **You.** I don’t want to
hurt anyone else. \]

\[Ahhhh, my cute… cute baby bird… Have you come to protect mommy…?\]

Vera twisted her neck grotesquely as she looked at Thunderbird Galia.
The flesh of her throat was torn and blood oozed from it.

The Thunderbird’s condition wasn’t great either. Its body was battered
and torn, and purple blood leaked from its entire body.

If I were to estimate its HP… around 20%? Its health was more depleted
than I expected. It must be due to the excellent support from the honor
students who joined the subjugation party, which helped Dorothy and Ian.

From Dorothy’s perspective, it must have been more convenient to reduce
the Thunderbird’s HP compared to the original scenario.

I didn’t know how well Ian performed, but I could see traces of light
mana here and there. It seemed that he managed to land some attacks.
Then, he must have passed out.

─────────────\[Kiaaaaaaaaaaa───!!\]

The Thunderbird screeched at me, it opened its beak full of neatly
arranged sharp teeth.

A giant purple magic circle was engraved around the Thunderbird. The
moment I saw it, I sensed my impending doom.

An insta-kill pattern that was used once the Thunderbird was cornered,
the 7-star lightning spell \[Thunderstorm Annihilation\]. The reason it
was an instant-kill was purely due to its immense ‘power.’

To block that spell, one must use a light elemental sword attack to
strike down all the purple magic stones that would protrude from the
Thunderbird’s body as soon as the magic circle manifested.

In other words… I couldn’t stop that spell.

I could feel the high-density mana that Hakil couldn’t even begin to
compare to.

It was the worst-case scenario. Truly, truly… the worst.

“…….”

Plan B, Plan C, Plan D… All the plans I had prepared to counter various
variables that would prevent a bad ending had been thrown out the
window.

In my focus to ensure Ian would survive the Thunderbird’s instant-kill
pattern, I had failed to consider the possibility of the Thunderbird
actually coming after me.

Failure. I failed.

An overwhelming amount of mana, unlike any demon I had ever faced
before, weighed down on me.

The magic circle’s majesty overwhelmed me.

*────Uuuuuu.*

Despite the situation being seemingly hopeless, my fiercely pounding
heart began to gradually calm down. Even as the Thunderbird screeched
and its earthshaking thunder roared, I carefully assessed the situation
despite \[Thunderstorm Annihilation\] trying to engulf me in terror.

Then I suddenly remembered a setting I had forgotten about.

The secondary effect of the passive \[Ice Sovereign\]. It was a setting
that had nothing to do with the story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, so I
had forgotten about it.

It was an effect that gave me a heart as cold as ice in the face of an
utterly hopeless situation.

It was the \[Frozen Soul\] effect contained within \[Ice Sovereign\].

I tried not to become used to failure.

During the days when I studied in a 3-pyeong one-room apartment in
Sillim-dong for 5 years, I piled up law books like a mountain in
preparation for the bar exam.

What scared me the most was getting used to this lifestyle.

Even though I failed the bar exam every year, I tried not to get used to
failure. I tried to think of that cramped space that confined me as just
a temporary accommodation.

So, while I studied under heavy pressure every day, I played ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱ as a reward for finishing my daily studies.

I tried to distract myself from the repeated failures and despair I
faced each and every year.

They say that if a person wore a psychological mask, that mask would
become their face.

Maybe the influence of those days played a part in my ability to resist
despair, even in the face of such a hopeless situation.

Well… it was a boring story.

「Ice Sovereign (Ice Element, ★9)」

“Cough…!”

Blood regurgitated and poured out of my mouth. It was because I had
unleashed the full power of \[Ice Sovereign\].

I felt as if every single cell in my body was being pricked by needles,
but it was more than bearable compared to when \[Hunter\] was
deactivated.

The saturation of my skin increased. My silver hair bristled, and a
gentle pale blue cold air gently flowed from my body.

Instinctively, I judged that I could only endure for up to 10 seconds.

***If it’s 10 seconds…***

‘It’s not just enough, it’s more than enough…!’

I judged that I had a chance of winning.

No, I wanted to believe in that sliver of hope. Otherwise, my feet
wouldn’t be able to move.

I kicked off the ground and leapt towards the Thunderbird like a spring.
Eight light blue magic circles followed me from behind, and in front of
the dark blue mana condensed in my right hand, the magic circle of
\[Black Ice Explosion\] was engraved.

───────────────\[Kiaaaaaaaaa─!!\]

In the blink of an eye.

My magic circle and the Thunderbird’s emitted a brilliant light,
unleashing their respective spells.

「Thunderstorm Annihilation (Lightning Element, ★7)」 「Abyssal Glacier
(Ice Element, ★7)」

*Tsupapapapapat─────────!!!!!*

*Kwagagagagagang─────────!!!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa─────────!!!!!*

A bright light engulfed everything in my sight.

As colossal bolts of lightning roared, they engraved their presence in
all directions without any gaps.

The eerie blue light of the \[Abyssal Glacier\] materialized, it caught
up with the speed of lightning and even froze the lightning bolts that
should have disappeared in an instant.

A cold gale accompanied by snow mercilessly lashed my skin with Carly
Hall at its focal point.

The pale blue chill flowed from my body due to the effect of \[Ice
Sovereign\]. It broke the momentum of the lightning strike. However, I
couldn’t block the sensation of currents coursing through my body.

And amidst the unstoppable collision, I slammed the dark blue ice mana I
had condensed in my right hand into the Thunderbird.

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

Again, and again, and again.

Without rest, I condensed the dark blue mana in both hands and wildly
swung my arms. I relentlessly fired \[Black Ice Explosion\] at the
Thunderbird.

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa───────!!!*

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaa────…*

My ears rang. I couldn’t hear properly.

Even so, I couldn’t think of anything other than casting spells until
the Thunderbird fell.

I ignored the pain that engulfed my entire body, I roared out like a
beast as if my throat was about to burst.

I condensed ice mana in both my hands and exploded it again and again.

I blasted \[Black Ice Explosion\] towards the Thunderbird.

Every time I unleashed \[Black Ice Explosion\], dark blue ice crystals
spread through the area and crumpled into dust, only to repeat this
cycle over and over again.

The subsequent explosions shattered a huge tree of frozen lightning that
had grown to encompass the area.

Dark blue masses of ice erupted. The ice of the afterlife scattered in
all directions.

I couldn’t think of anything else. I instinctively used defrost to
eliminate the ice created by \[Abyssal Glacier\].

A cold wind rushed in. The eerie blue mana ran rampant as the ice of the
afterlife disappeared.

At that moment,

What caught my eyes was the black Thunderbird, twisted and trapped
within the enormous piece of ice.

Vera the Summoner, who had been lying beside the ice, had half her body
blown off. The rest of her body was no different from a severely injured
person that was frozen and frostbitten.

It seemed to have happened when my ice mana exploded, condensed, and
exploded again.

She looked at me with a distorted face before turning into ash-like dust
and scattering.

When I finally regained my senses, I was amidst a snowstorm and cold
gale.

I just stood there.

Standing.

125)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 60!\]

Chapter 46: - Thunderbird Subjugation (4)
=========================================

**༺ Thunderbird Subjugation (4) ༻**

It felt like I was nestled in a cozy cocoon.

The intense pain that had enveloped my entire body had softened. As I
blinked a few times, my blurry vision cleared, and the surrounding
scenery was revealed.

Then, my eyes widened.

It was a bright world. That was the only way I could describe it.

The sun that hung in the sky emanated a gentle sensation that did not
dazzle the eyes.

Surrounding me were rows of trees that emitted a pale yellow light.
Beyond the horizon, there was nothing but an unfamiliar light.

“What is this place…?”

I was invited to an unknown world. It was like the \[Fictional Hell\]
that Leafa the Illusive had used.

However, the difference between this bright world and \[Fictional Hell\]
was that I had never seen this place in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. It
was uncharted territory.

Despite my bewildered state, I tried to make sense of the situation.

\[Are you surprised?\]

“……!!”

A deep voice rang in my head. I quickly turned my head in the direction
of the voice.

There stood a massive black bird that appeared out of place in the
surrounding scenery, it folded its wings and looked down at me. It was
‘Thunderbird Galia’.

My heart sank for a brief moment, but when I realized that it wasn’t in
a combat stance, I dropped my guard.

“What’s going on?”

\[It seems that we are in the ‘Midheaven Realm’. It appears that my
former master invited us here.\]

The Midheaven Realm. A place where souls who were near death, or who had
died but had not yet passed on, were invited in order to sort out their
thoughts and eventually find solace.

It also served as a relay point for the souls who yearn to meet other
souls in the afterlife. This allowed them to spend the rest of eternity
together.

It was a setting in the ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ guidebook. It was
known as a setting prepared for the characters who had unfortunately
died.

In the game’s story, however, there was no reason for Ian to come to
this world. The game ended with him becoming a renowned Magic Knight who
had established a happy family with the chosen heroine.

‘So, here I am…’

As far as I knew, the Midheaven Realm was located on the boundary
between this world and the afterlife. In this world, time passed
indefinitely, and thus no time passed in reality.

There was nothing to do here. Not even magic worked here.

It seemed that the one who had invited me into this world was the
previous master of the Thunderbird, the ‘Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath’.
A tragic witch from Luce’s past who embraced death under false
accusations.

“Where is your former master?”

The Thunderbird raised its head and pointed its beak towards the sun,
which emanated a gentle light. Its rays softly warmed my entire body.

\[The scent I longed for is coming from over there.\]

Did that mean that the sun was the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath?

Although I somewhat understood the situation, I couldn’t help but feel a
little confused.

Moreover, the \[To Gretel\] achievement was one of the legendary
achievements that were unlocked when one cleared a major scenario, but
there were no separate rewards or new events. It was merely a trophy of
sorts.

Who could have ever imagined that it would turn out like this?

\[I want to know your name.\]

The voice of the Thunderbird echoed in my head. It felt like it
resonated within my head.

“…Isaac.”

\[I am ‘Galia’… After suffering under that curse for years… Thank you
for saving me, child. I truly mean this from the bottom of my heart…
Thank you.\]

The deep yet gentle voice of the Thunderbird contained a subtle sob. I
could only watch his figure in silence

\[Adadapubu!\]

Suddenly, the voice of an energetic boy came from my feet.

As I lowered my head, I saw a small familar staring at me intently. It
was a raccoon familiar with lightning mana wrapped around its tail.

A status window did not appear. Perhaps it was because there was no
physical body.

But, what is this…?

“……!”

Suddenly, numerous magic beasts with elemental mana wrapped around their
bodies surrounded me. They appeared in front of me in the blink of an
eye.

I was startled and hastily looked around.

These familiars were…

“The ones I fought earlier…?”

These were the familiars that had been completely corrupted by the
darkness mana and met a gruesome end by my magic.

However, there were no longer any traces of darkness mana on their
bodies.

\[Thank you, pubu!\]

“Huh?”

The purple raccoon familiar shouted at my feet before tightly hugging my
leg.

Then, the familiars that had surrounded me started to approach me.

They gently rubbed their cheeks against my body, cuddled me, or licked
my cheeks and the back of my hands with their tongues.

I felt utterly bewildered.

\[Thank you, meow!\]

\[Kuooooh─! Thank you! Thank you so much!\]

\[Thank you for freeing me from that demon!\]

\[Thank you, thank you…\]

\[Gratitude to the Great One!\]

The voices of countless familiars gently echoed in my head like waves.

The bitter emotions they had harbored while being controlled by Vera the
Summoner were seeping into me.

With each word they uttered, an erratic, lukewarm wave seemed to
continuously engulf my heart, giving me a solemn feeling.

\[Kyahahaha! You’re strong, friend! You took a good hit!\]

Hakil, the giant red magic beast, approached me with a hearty laugh. His
turtle head, muscular body, and the eyes on his three pairs of wings
were still the same.

The familars stopped their affectionate gestures and looked at Hakil in
unison.

Hakil stopped in front of me, looked down at me gently, and bent one
knee to sit down.

The eyes on Hakil’s wings were all closed. His wings were slightly
folded as if to show his respect towards me.

\[You see, I always wanted to explore the vast world with my master.\]

Hakil murmured with his eyes lowered.

\[But, after being controlled by that demon… I ended up killing my
master with my own hands. That day, I lost everything.\]

A grumbling voice faintly echoed in my mind.

\[Living under that demon was truly horrible… Even though we were once
enemies, thank you for saving me… Really, thank you… I will never forget
this favor…\]

Hakil couldn’t hold back the tears and covered his eyes with his large
hands.

After Hakil, the other familiars began to share their own stories. I
listened in silence.

\[I met that demon while eating meat with my master, meow… Now, I can
never forget the smell of my master’s blood, meow…\]

\[My master always fell asleep with me in their arms. I loved being in
their embrace… But I killed them with my own hands. As they were dying,
they told me it was okay. They thanked me for traveling with them…\]

\[My master picked me up when I was abandoned. I still vividly remember
the sensation of piercing their heart…\]

\[Adadapubu…\]

\[Jerry, I was so angry being forcibly controlled by that woman! I was
so mad! It was so hard! I cried every day!\]

I couldn’t save them. They had been so deeply corrupted by the darkness
mana that they couldn’t be saved, even if Vera the Summoner had died.

Even if they had been freed from Vera, they would have lived a cursed
existence, unable to suppress their murderous urges. They would have
continued to kill people.

That’s right. I didn’t deserve their gratitude. I had simply killed the
familars here without hesitation to prevent a bad ending.

Yet they thought I had saved them.

They had longed for death, for an end to their suffering.

“Is that so…”

Despite the numerous voices that echoed in my head, I understood each
and every one of the familiars’ stories.

So, I felt relieved.

For a while, the familiars shared the numerous stories they had
accumulated over their life, laughing and crying as they spoke.

I nodded my head, stroked their heads, and patted their backs.

***How much time had passed?***

On the horizon, one or two human figures emerged in the vast expanse of
light. Their numbers quickly multiplied, reaching dozens in no time.

As if coming to greet us, the individuals turned their gaze towards us.

The intensity of the light made it difficult to make out their exact
appearance, yet it seemed that all the familiars recognized them.

\[…?\]

The familiars froze in shock, as if time itself had stopped. Hakil’s
eyes also widened in disbelief.

This place served as a relay for souls in the afterlife. It was obvious
who the people in the Midheaven Realm had brought along with them.

Soon, tears began welling up in the eyes of the familiars.

They ran or flew towards those people.

In an instant.

The familiars cried as they hugged their masters. They shared how much
they had missed them and how sad they had been.

The masters tightly hugged their familiars, stroked their heads, and
listened to their cries with a gentle smile.

\[It’s been a while, Dyke.\]

Hakil stood in front of his master, a muscular man, and greeted him.

As his master chuckled and extended his fist, Hakil hesitated for a
moment.

\[…\]

Hakil bumped fists with the muscular man. He seemed to be deep in
thought as he recalled the time he had spent with his master.

Soon after, the familiars and their respective masters started walking
together, towards the vast world of light, into the afterlife.

The familiars looked back at me and shouted their farewells.

\[Thank you! Really, thank you!\]

\[Thank you, human!\]

\[I won’t forget this favor!\]

\[Adadapubu!\]

\[I’m really grateful, meow!\]

\[Kuooh! This mark of flame! I will remember you forever!\]

\[I’ll keep the grace of your noble deed in this body of fire even in
the afterlife…!\]

\[Take care! Thank you! Thank you! Really, really, thank you…!\]

The vivid light enveloped the familiars as they returned to their
masters.

They disappeared beyond the horizon with excitement.

I silently watched the scene and felt an indescribable emotion.

Now, they would be together for an eternity. That would be long enough
to forget the pain they had experienced.

They would embark on new adventures that they couldn’t complete in this
world.

The figures of the familiars disappeared from my sight.

I closed my eyes for a moment, then quietly processed my emotions.

\[I can feel it.\]

The voice of the Thunderbird rang in my head.

\[My former master seems to be very grateful.\]

Though the sun was merely warm and gentle to me, it seemed to feel
different to the Thunderbird.

\[Even when I lost my reason, I could still feel Gretel’s heart. So I
knew that you became her friend. I wanted to say thank you, child. It
seems my former master is also grateful to you for the same reason.\]

“…”

Gretel. The former name of Luce.

I was deep in thought. I calmly raised my head and stared at the Great
Witch of Heaven’s Wrath, who had been watching over the boundary between
this world and the next.

In 「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird Subjugation」 of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, there remained one final mission—

—To catch Luce, who was helplessly falling through the sky, her mana
completely depleted. This journey would end with just that task.

But then I realized why I was in the Midheaven Realm.

I needed some time to organize my thoughts.

“…I’m about to die, right? And so are you.”

I asked as I turned my head towards the Thunderbird.

The Thunderbird bowed its head.

\[It seemed like you were deliberately hiding your identity, so I
intended to protect your secret, but it seems there’s no need to do that
now.\]

A roundabout answer. It wasn’t difficult to grasp what those words
meant.

Ha, I knew this would happen. How could I have survived unscathed after
fighting against the level 175 Thunderbird Galia?

It was a futile ending. I did all that to prevent a bad ending…

However, there was no rush of emotions, no flicker of intensity. It felt
as if even the most fleeting emotions passed by without leaving a trace.

Being able to stay calm even in the face of death must be due to the
effect of \[Ice Sovereign\].

Someone once said, ‘If the world were to end tomorrow, I would still
plant an apple tree today.’ That’s exactly how I felt at this moment.

“Send me back.”

***Since it’s come to this, there’s one last thing I need to do.***

“Luce is about to fall. There’s no one else to catch her but me.”

***If I’m destined to die anyways, I might as well save someone I deeply
cherish.***

***I adore Luce. As long as ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ is my reality, I
can’t bear to see her get hurt.***

***So, at the very least, I want to save Luce before I go.***

And then it happened.

\[The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath expresses her gratitude to you!\]
\[The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath gazes into your fate and offers you
with the gift she deems most necessary for you!\]

A new system window appeared.

“Ugh!”

Suddenly, I felt a searing pain on my left wrist.

Startled, I looked at my wrist. A black, magic circle-shaped seal was
being engraved on it.

Once it was completely engraved, the pain immediately stopped.

“What is this…?”

\[Congratulations! You have acquired the \[8-star Familiar Contract
Circle\]!\]

My mouth was wide open.

Magic beasts from 1-star to 4-star could be summoned with a Familiar
Summoning Circle, and if their wills align, a contract could be formed.

From 5-star to 7-star, they couldn’t be summoned by a Familiar Summoning
Circle, but if they meet and their wills align, a contract could be
formed.

On the other hand, an 8-star couldn’t form a familiar contract at will,
even if they had a good relationship or understood each other well. A
special seal was required. That seal, the ‘8-star Familiar Contract
Circle’, could only be obtained in the very late stages of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱.

The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath had bestowed that upon me.

What kind of fate did she see to give this to someone who was about to
die?

Just as I was about to ask the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath, I lost my
voice.

The light emitting from the witch began to envelop my entire body.

***─ To Gretel.***

Suddenly, a young girl in a worn-out navy blue dress appeared before my
eyes. Her rose-gold hair was particularly beautiful.

She was laughing at an old witch who wore a black witch’s hat with a
hooked nose.

A curious 10-year-old girl. She held the witch’s hand and set off on an
adventure.

Time passed, and the girl in a school uniform was smiling brightly at
the academy’s graduation ceremony with the witch.

Time passed again, and the woman who became a wizard boasted about her
achievements to the witch.

Time had passed once again, and the lady who became a Tower Master held
the witch’s hand and embarked on a new adventure.

Her beaming smile was no different from the innocent laughter of the
10-year-old girl. The witch was so content with this scene that she
laughed happily.

The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath. The events that would have unfolded
had she not died of tragedy.

The fate envisioned by the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath, a reality that
never came to be.

They were fragments of a lost future, a calm solace in the sea of
memories.

***─ I will always love you.***

Taking in that sight for the last time, I quietly closed my eyes.

Chapter 47: - Thunderbird Subjugation (5)
=========================================

**༺ Thunderbird Subjugation (5) ༻**

It was a famous story.

Hansel and Gretel were born to a poor family in the woods. Their
parents, who could no longer care for them, abandoned the young pair of
siblings in the woods.

The young girl, Gretel, cleverly dropped several stones along the way,
which helped her and Hansel find their way back home.

However, they were abandoned once again.

They didn’t have any stones prepared the next time, so they left
breadcrumbs to mark their path.

Unfortunately, the breadcrumbs were eaten by the forest birds, leaving
them unable to find their way home.

Hunger struck. The young siblings wandered through the woods in search
of food.

Unexpectedly, they discovered a house made of sweets and started
hurriedly eating their fill, only to encounter the hooked-nose witch who
lived inside.

The witch took in the abandoned Hansel and Gretel.

She cared for them wholeheartedly, but her true intentions were─

The First Episode of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Behind the Scenes –
Hansel and Gretel」.

In the game, the original story of the fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel,
took a twisted turn.

One day, Hansel started to fatten up. The witch checked his condition by
grabbing his wrist every day.

Out of nowhere, Hansel’s body began to swell abnormally.

Not just Hansel, but children from other places had also begun to
experience grotesque swelling.

It was the activation of the Evil Dragon’s Sacrificial Seal.

Hansel’s and Gretel’s parents had allowed a high-ranking noble to
sequentially engrave the Evil Dragon’s Sacrificial Seal on their
children, in exchange for a piece of meat.

The seal was engraved on parts of the eye and brain.

When the witch first discovered Hansel and Gretel, it was already too
late to save Hansel.

Fortunately, it was just in time to save Gretel. The witch managed to
replace the parts of her eye and brain where the seal had been engraved,
preventing her from becoming the Evil Dragon’s sacrifice.

This was the setting for Gretel’s sudden improvement in eyesight and her
ability to remember everything she saw. It was all thanks to the Candy
House Witch’s research, who burned her very own body.

The witch knew that the Evil Dragon Orchis would appear and had tried to
save the children in advance. She made her house from sweets to attract
the children who had been victimized by the Evil Dragon.

Eventually, the sky turned red.

A massive black dragon, composed of countless decaying human corpses,
burst through the clouds.

It was the Evil Dragon Orchis, a catastrophe capable of destroying
nations.

The witch summoned her 8-star familiar, Thunderbird Galia, to confront
the Evil Dragon and ultimately emerged victorious…

Unfortunately, the Curse of the Evil Dragon befell the Thunderbird.

The Candy House Witch was falsely accused of using children as
sacrifices to summon the Evil Dragon and was executed by the empire in
front of her house.

Gretel tearfully hugged the witch in front of the numerous military
forces. The witch entrusted Gretel with the Thunderbird and took her
last breath.

Gretel’s heart shattered at that moment.

Eventually, the truth was revealed, and the high-ranking noble who was
the real culprit behind the summoning of the Evil Dragon Orchis was
captured by the royal family and promptly executed. However, the country
engraved the Witch of the Candy House, who should have been recognized
as a hero, as an evil woman in history.

There was no better scapegoat than the Candy House Witch, who wasn’t
entangled in any political disputes.

She was initially accused of killing many children. Although it was a
false accusation, the cruel experimental area that used her own body as
a test subject became a fitting piece of evidence for the charge.

Thus, the Candy House Witch was labeled as the “Great Witch of Heaven’s
Wrath” by attributing all sorts of grotesque evil deeds to her, which
made her an enemy of the people.

Only the Eltania family, who had received grace from the Candy House
Witch, denied her infamy as the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath.

They took in Gretel as their own per the witch’s request.

And gave the child, who was struggling with her past, a new name – Luce
Eltania.

The barrier enveloped in purple lightning turned into shining powder and
scattered into the sky.

On the altar at the top floor of Carly Hall, which was so severely
damaged that it no longer resembled a building.

Luce’s body started falling as the barrier of the Thunderbird was
released.

*Thump─*

A man caught her.

Luce couldn’t muster any strength. Her mana was completely drained by
the Thunderbird, and even her energy seemed to be depleted.

Luce slowly opened her eyes, but her vision was so blurry that she
couldn’t make anything out.

However, she could tell that a man was holding her in a princess carry.

‘Who…?’

No words came out of her mouth. Her mouth didn’t move.

With her blurry vision, Luce could barely discern the color of the man’s
clothes and the outline of his shoulders.

Navy blue clothes, and broad shoulders. She felt the faint chill of ice
mana.

‘Greung… It must be you.’

There was no one else that came to mind as a navy blue clad ice element
user who could have broken through the Thunderbird and the demons.

His physique looked different from what Luce knew, as if his disguise
had been blown.

***But this physique… feels oddly familiar.***

*─ ‘Don’t elementalize your mana; instead, let it flow freely for the
time being. And remember this sensation.’*

*─ ‘…I’m going to release it now.’*

*─ ‘Not yet!’*

*─ ‘Puhahaha! Ahahahahahaha! Hahahahaha! Oh, that’s so funny…! My
stomach hurts…’*

When she had been practicing elemental flower crafts.

The memory of holding the hand of her silver-blue haired friend popped
up.

Greung’s touch on her arms and legs overlapped with that memory.

She wasn’t certain because the fabric of the clothes was in the way.
However, the size of the hand she felt was too similar to that man’s.

Luce’s pupils were shaking slightly.

‘I…saac…?’

Drained of all her mana, Luce had no strength left.

Soon, her stamina reached its limit.

Her consciousness faded into the far distance.

\* \* \*

\[Guu, guuu, guuk…!\]

As soon as I left the Midheaven Realm, I could feel how limited my body
truly was.

With the last of my strength, I caught Luce as she fell from the altar.
I hastily erased the traces of my magic with defrost, and knew that I
would soon be unable to move.

I laid the unconscious Luce on the ground as the blue powder scattered.
Then, I summoned Eden and had her lean against the altar.

I then ordered Eden to take me and run away. It was entirely possible.

Eden was able to grow in size by adding rocks to his body.

Eden, now a size that fitted his golem race, ran with me in his arms.

He urgently shouted at me with a thickened voice.

The side effects of the \[Ice Sovereign\] and the battle against the
Thunderbird rendered my body unable to properly function. The pain was
excruciating, it was as if I was struck by a hammer all over my body,
tormenting me relentlessly.

However, I didn’t even have the strength to wriggle or cry out in pain.

“Eden… let me down… here…”

I didn’t know where I was. My vision had become blurry, and I couldn’t
see anything.

I was sure we had come quite far. My senses told me that we were behind
Carly Hall, at the bottom of the hill.

Perhaps just before entering the forest. It seemed like we were on the
outskirts of the old Märchen Academy grounds.

The area was filled with the vibrant scent of trees and grass.
Fortunately, it seemed like we had arrived at an inconspicuous spot.

Eden laid me down on the grass. His voice was full of choking sobs. I
couldn’t help but feel sorry.

When I could still see ahead, the last sight I had captured shimmered
like a mirage.

Was it the beauty of the landscape? Perhaps it was because of the
Thunderbird’s barrier being lifted and the disappearance of the
Lightning Harpies. Or maybe it was the purple powder being engraved in
the night sky like starlight.

As I drifted through the memories of that landscape, I desperately clung
to my fading mind and reminded myself why I had fled.

The Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath.

She had looked into my fate and given me an 8-star contract circle as a
gift, saying it was what I needed most.

In other words, I wouldn’t die.

That’s why I had fled, trying not to be noticed by the subjugation
party.

Suddenly, I recalled everything that had happened since I came to this
world. I possessed Isaac, realized the protagonist’s skills were
terrible, and diligently tried to prevent a bad ending during the first
semester.

As I looked back on the past.

It seemed like a futile way to meet my end, dying like this.

An extra of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Isaac.

I was not the protagonist of this world, Ian Fairytale was. All the
hardships in this world existed to make him a hero.

***What difference does that make?***

No matter what, in my position, I was the protagonist.

Even if my life seemed bleak, unsuccessful, and full of failure, I
firmly believed that I was the protagonist of my own story.

Even if Isaac was an extra when I played the game as Ian.

***If I live in this reality as Isaac, then I am the protagonist.***

Ian Fairytale. No matter what trials and tribulations came in ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱, he overcame them. So I, too, had been trying to
overcome all the trials and tribulations that had come my way, following
his example.

***So, will I die meaninglessly? Will I give up so easily?***

My specialty was gritting my teeth and relentlessly pursuing my goals. I
would never give up.

“…”

Only the sound of air escaping from my lungs seeped through my lips.

I was running out of strength. Slowly, my eyes closed. The anticipation
of being freed from this terrible agony once I closed my eyes welled up
within me.

My head was spinning. Still, I would never extinguish my will to never
give up.

In my hazy vision.

Slowly, a pitch-black darkness descended.

「Tree of Radiance (Plant Element, ★7)」

A gentle energy enveloped me. It felt as if new life was coursing
through my body.

I opened my eyes. The sight of the barrier turning into a purple powder
that illuminated the night sky caught my eye. My vision had returned.

I turned my head to look towards Carly Hall above the hill.

A gigantic tree, emitting a soft green glow, had casted a faint light
over the old Märchen Academy grounds. Countless fireflies spread out in
all directions without any gaps.

The pain faded.

Slowly, I raised my upper body.

Eden sobbed, shrank back to his usual size, and snuggled into my arms.

\[Kyu…! Kyuuu…!\]

\[Eden\] **Psychology:** \[Feeling happy and relieved that you’ve come
back to life.\]

The radiant tree stretched above Carly Hall.

I knew what that tree was. It was Kaya Astrean’s plant magic, the \[Tree
of Radiance\], which appeared in the second year of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱. It indiscriminately healed all living creatures within a
certain radius.

‘Why is that already…?’

The soft green fireflies from the \[Tree of Radiance\] flew over and
infused vitality into the plants around me.

In the midst of those fireflies, I could guess the situation and its
developments.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 3, Chapter 3, End Of Semester
Evaluation」 immediately led to 「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird
Subjugation」.

In other words, the variables that occurred during the end of semester
evaluation carried over to the Thunderbird Subjugation.

What could have been a variable worth mentioning in this end of semester
evaluation?

The most significant events would have been Luce’s inexplicable
massacre, the great battle, and the gift I gave to Kaya.

Due to Luce, the top students’ search for Fell Cards was delayed. They
must have had difficulty with mana perception, exploration, and card
snatching because they were too focused on escaping from the monster,
Luce.

Moreover, because of the large-scale battle, the second and third seats,
as well as other A class students and the top B class students, had to
remain at the exam site until the appearance of Vera the Summoner.

As a result, most of the honor students joined the subjugation party, in
contrast to the game.

It was obvious that they would have helped Dorothy and Ian chip away at
the Thunderbird’s HP. That must have been why the Thunderbird’s HP was
reduced faster than I had expected.

If they hadn’t been there, I would have had to fight the Thunderbird
with at least 30-40% more HP.

I wouldn’t have been able to avoid instant death if I lost that battle.

The same went for Kaya.

In the Thunderbird Subjugation of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Kaya
couldn’t join the subjugation party. She quickly passed the exam once
her mana perception improved after she found her third Fell Card.

However, as Luce became a significant variable, Kaya ended up in the
exam site until the appearance of Vera.

Kaya also participated in the Thunderbird Subjugation and would have
felt a sense of anger as she watched the casualties accumulate. It was
inevitable due to her personality.

She would have longed to be of help, instead of only relying on Dorothy.

The gift I gave her, the Armana Wand, was Kaya’s final weapon. It was
impossible to obtain this weapon in the early parts of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱. It was purely a matter of money. However, I managed to acquire
it early.

As a result, the Armana Wand I gifted to Kaya would have significantly
increased her sensitivity to plant mana.

Kaya’s desire would have been realized in the form of a tree that
emitted a warm light.

‘It’s so beautiful, really…’

The \[Tree of Radiance\].

A spell that healed all living creatures within a certain radius. Its
healing range was quite wide. It was considered one of the most powerful
healing spells, as it could heal even fatal wounds in an instant.

Moreover, it was a plant spell. To use this element, one must receive
the help of Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy, and completely react to plant
mana. It would be difficult for an ordinary person, even if they tried
for a hundred years.

A gentle green light enveloped the grounds of the old Märchen Academy.
As I unexpectedly regained my health, I felt an overwhelming sense of
bewilderment.

The only thing I could do was laugh.

It felt as if that tree was the result of my journey throughout the
first semester of my freshman year.

An emotion that I couldn’t put into words welled up inside of me.

I quietly gazed at the Tree of Radiance.

The combination of the purple powder slowly scattered by the
disappearance of the Thunderbird’s barrier and the giant radiant tree
that stood alone in silence was incredibly beautiful.

I couldn’t take my eyes off it for a while.

“…”

However, I couldn’t just be lost in admiration. I needed to take off my
Magic Cloak of Disguise just in case.

“Hua!”

I took off my cloak and put it in my magic pouch. Although the Tree of
Radiance fully healed my wounds, my strength hadn’t recovered. Just the
act of taking off my cloak was quite difficult.

I thought I needed to bask in the light of the Tree of Radiance at least
until my strength had recovered enough to return to the dormitory. It
was like Isaac’s photosynthesis.

Eden came to my side and shook my arm. Such a cute little guy. I seated
Eden on my lap and hugged him.

That was when it happened.

“President, what are you doing here?”

A familiar voice echoed in my ears. For some reason, I felt an
inexplicable sensation rising in my chest.

When I turned my head towards the voice, I saw a female student wearing
a witch’s hat. She looked at me with a questioning gaze, her hands
resting on her knees.

Was it because I almost died for a moment?

I couldn’t help but smile as soon as I saw her welcoming face. I fought
back against the tears that welled up and managed to fill my face with
nothing but a smile.

I took a quick, deep breath to regain my composure.

I locked eyes with the beautiful female student with purple hair that
was reflected in my vision.

“Senior, you’re late. Aren’t you coming to my rescue too late?”

I jokingly said to Dorothy Heartnova, and deliberately showed a tired
expression.

“Seriously, a bunch of electric bird-like demonic creatures suddenly
appeared… I barely escaped, you know.”

“Your expression seems a little too relaxed for that.”

“It’s because I’m looking at you, senior.”

“Nihihi, just like how my fan should be!”

Dorothy sat down next to me with a “Ucha” and hugged her knees.

Then, she stared at the Tree of Radiance, scattering its glorious
jade-colored mana.

“Everything’s resolved. The giant electric chicken was healed by that
tree magic and is no longer our enemy. All the lightning demonic
creatures have disappeared. Your stalker friend is safe too. No one
died.”

“I was wondering what was going on, but it seems like it was a pretty
big deal…”

“Yeah, it was a huge deal\~ I’m completely exhausted. Trying to protect
people, doing this and that…”

Dorothy grumbled cheekily, then suddenly smiled and put her hand on her
chest.

“So give me, your big sis, a chance to be comforted by our president\~
Consider it an honor.”

Dorothy’s cheeky words were so cute that I inadvertently chuckled.

“You’ve worked hard, senior.”

“Oh yeah!”

“You’re really strong and cool, senior.”

“Uh-huh!”

“Although, you were too late to come and save me.”

“Uh, ah…”

Dorothy, with a flustered face, broke into a cold sweat.

“Well… It seems like our president had a hard time too.”

Dorothy sneakily glanced at me, and quickly changed the subject. I
responded with a cheeky attitude, just like she had moments ago.

“Yes, I had to take the exams, and then run away from the sudden
appearance of demonic creatures… It was just awful. I should’ve just
gone straight to the dorms. Instead, I got into this mess because I
wanted to tour the old building.”

As I felt more relaxed, a flood of lies gushed out of my mouth.

However, Dorothy’s eyes, which seemingly held the universe within them,
revealed a meaningful expression. It was as if she knew something I
didn’t.

***Is it just my imagination?***

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Psychology:** \[★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆\]

I still couldn’t read her mind with \[Psychology\]. So, I decided to
give up on trying to read her thoughts.

“Yep, you’ve worked hard.”

Dorothy replied with a gentle smile and a soothing voice.

There was a moment of silence.

“Senior.”

“Yes, president?”

“I ran quite a lot today, and my body doesn’t want to move anymore.
Could you help me get to the dorms?”

“Nihihi! Leave it to your big sis!”

Dorothy replied as she innocently laughed and placed her hand on her
chest again.

In the first semester of my freshman year, I managed to prevent all the
bad endings and survived.

I was more relieved than happy.

For a while, Dorothy and I decided to sit side by side and admire the
Tree of Radiance.

It wasn’t something you saw every day, so we thought we might as well
enjoy it while we still had the chance.

***At that moment, I was grateful that you, the one I love, was by my
side.***

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 3, Chapter 4, Thunderbird Subjugation」.

The curtain falls.

<span id="0047_48_-_Thunderbird_Subjugation_-_Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 48: - Thunderbird Subjugation - Interlude
=================================================

**༺ Thunderbird Subjugation – Interlude ༻**

It was when Isaac and the Thunderbird were engaged in a battle at Carly
Hall.

“It’s the black monster!”

As the Thunderbird subjugation party made their way to Carly Hall, they
immediately recognized the adversary of the Thunderbird and the army of
familiars.

An entity that appeared whenever demons emerged. If there was a being
powerful enough to cast ice magic on such a large scale, it could only
be the ‘Black Monster’.

Ciel, who had participated in the subjugation party, narrowed her eyes.
She suddenly thought of the silver-blue haired man.

Despite having a relatively small amount of mana, he possessed a mana
perception that was incomparable to her own.

Mana perception was proportional to the maximum amount of mana one had.

Ciel wondered how he could have such a frightening mana perception
despite being so weak, but a possibility that came to her mind tried to
resolve this contradiction.

“Could it be…”

What if the black monster was the silver-blue haired man who had been
groveling just a while ago?

A terrifying battle had taken place in Carly Hall.

Ciel had always thought she was talented and strong, but she felt that
if she had been caught in that battle, she would have faced an end that
was more futile than that of a mayfly^1^This is referring to how
Mayflies only live for up to 24 hours.

The end of an insect trampled by a passerby would have been more
spectacular.

Of course… this was just her suspicion. She might have mistakenly
labeled an innocent person as a powerful being.

‘Well, that would be ridiculous.’

Due to her disdain for running, Ciel supported the rear of the
subjugation party while walking up the hill.

Eventually, her familiar, which she had secretly sent into the sky, flew
back to her.

‘Zabet’, a purple bat familiar with the lightning element landed on her
shoulder. It flapped its wings with a surprised look on its face.

\[Ci-Ciel! You were right! It was him! The one who was with you
earlier!\]

Zabet had urgently descended after it confirmed the situation just
before the Thunderbird and Isaac had clashed. Although it had been swept
up in the violent storm that followed their clash, it wasn’t injured.

Ciel closed her eyes slightly as she looked at the fussing Zabet. It was
the moment when her suspicion turned into certainty.

It was said that every year, extraordinarily powerful individuals would
enroll into Märchen Academy. It seemed that this year’s freshmen were no
exception.

Furthermore, the fact that it was not Luce Eltania, but someone who
couldn’t even be compared to the powerful top seat.

Only now did Ciel realize it.

After the situation had ended. Above the old Märchen Academy.

\[Boo─, boo─.\]

A round, balloon-like creature was floating in the sky.

Its arms and legs were submerged into its swollen body, and its
grotesque, layered face was enough to disgust anyone.

Its yellowish-brown skin had a pattern that was like cracks on a dry
rice field.

All that came out of its mouth was the foolish ‘Boo’ sound.

From the end of semester evaluation to the Thunderbird Subjugation.

That powerless balloon demon watched all the scenes with its
\[Clairvoyance\] ability.

The closed eyelids slowly rose. The cold, bloodshot eyes looked down at
the ground.

Heinkel the Hoarder. Although he was powerless right now, he was one of
the worst calamities. He watched Isaac, who was admiring the \[Tree of
Radiance\], in silence.

\[Boo─, boo─.\]

Soon, Heinkel the Hoarder hid his tracks above the clouds.

\* \* \*

The academy’s staff had to go through all sorts of trouble after the
appearance of a demon and the Thunderbird Subjugation. It involved
on-site investigations, uncovering the truth, investigating the victims,
persuading investors who had a significant share in the academy’s
finances, analyzing the causes of the incident, ways to improve
security, etc… The academy was putting all its manpower into it.

This Thunderbird incident wasn’t just significant, it was too
significant. If it had gone wrong, it could have resulted in numerous
casualties.

Ultimately, when summer vacation arrived, the imperial knights who had
heard the news about the Märchen Academy would come. The situation would
continue to escalate, and the academy’s staff would rack their brains to
the point that it bled.

Luce attended the Truth Investigation Committee as the owner of
Thunderbird Galia. However, since it was clear that the demons had
forcibly summoned Thunderbird Galia against Luce’s will, there was no
reason to punish the innocent girl.

However, Thunderbird Galia was an 8-star magic beast. If the
nation-destroying magic beast caused havoc for any reason, the academy
couldn’t leave it alone. They needed to ensure that the familiar was
safe.

The problem was that Luce was currently in a state of mana exhaustion,
which made it difficult to even use the most basic of elemental spells,
let alone summoning her familiar.

No matter how much mana someone had, the speed at which mana recovered
would drastically drop when mana was depleted. No, even the expression
‘drastically’ was an understatement. It would take about a week for
Luce’s condition to return to normal.

In the end, the academy asked for Luce’s understanding and decided to
place her in quarantine until she recovered.

They also assigned someone to supervise Luce.

“Is this the room of the clueless junior who made me suffer\~?”

Charles Hall, a luxurious dormitory reserved for only the top-ranking
students of Märchen Academy.

Luce, dressed in a comfortable one-piece, sat on her bed with a blanket
over her head. It was only after a lavender-haired woman in a witch’s
hat entered the room that a thick, fog-like threatening aura began to
emanate from her.

Supervisor, Dorothy Heartnova. She had an atmosphere of being aloof
towards Luce’s childish gaze. As a result, the atmosphere between Luce
and Dorothy created a distinct contrast that clearly divided the room in
half.

After all, Dorothy was said to be a natural disaster. An existence that
couldn’t be bound by any law or rule. Luce’s murderous gaze was nothing
more than a passing ant to Dorothy.

Dorothy covered her eyes with a handkerchief and wandered around Luce’s
room like an adventurer exploring an area that had yet to be discovered.

Luce was annoyed by her behavior.

But since she was in a state of mana exhaustion, she had no means to
oppose Dorothy and just ground her teeth in silence.

“Nyahaha! This room perfectly reflects your personality! What’s with the
interior, there’s not a single cute corner!”

“…”

“There’s not even a single teddy bear! Are you poor? Do you want to
borrow one of mine?”

“…”

“Kyaaa, what’s this? It’s a cursed doll used in black magic! Our junior
has a shady hobby\~ Oh, can I try putting our junior’s hair in it when
I’m bored? That’s fine, right?”

“Get out if you came here to pick a fight.”

Luce, unable to bear it any longer, finally spoke up. They were the
first words she had spoken in the 10 minutes since Dorothy arrived. She
spoke her mind, regardless of whether the other person was her senior or
the strongest powerhouse of the academy.

But Dorothy, as if she knew it would happen, opened her crescent-shaped
eyes and approached Luce with a mischievous smile.

Dorothy sat on the edge of the bed and tilted her head at Luce. Luce
intentionally avoided eye contact with Dorothy.

“Junior, you noticed something strange, right?”

“…”

“You don’t have to suppress that electric chicken anymore.”

Luce frowned. Then she finally made eye contact with Dorothy.

Dorothy’s pupils always shined like a universe embroidered with
starlight. The star-shaped pupils were still there. They were as unreal
as ever.

She had made a contract with the star fairy, Stella. Her eyes were
uniquely altered under the fairy’s influence. Luce heard that story when
she was with Isaac.

At that time, Luce didn’t care about the details of the conversation,
she just enjoyed her time with Isaac and quietly listened.

It was clear that this unpleasant senior was a strong individual.

Luce didn’t think it was strange for Dorothy to find out she had been
pouring half of her total mana, which amounted to all of her lightning
mana, at all times to suppress the Thunderbird.

Luce only reacted to the fact that she no longer needed to suppress the
Thunderbird.

Luce, the master of Thunderbird Galia, had clearly felt that he had been
freed from the chains of various curses and returned to being a docile
familiar. Now it was unknown what her own condition would be once her
mana had recovered.

However, one thing was certain.

Luce would now be able to use her full power.

If nothing else, it further cemented herself as the strongest first-year
in the Magic Department.

“…Galia is free now.”

“I know, the electric chicken is a good boy.”

“Stop calling him an electric chicken. It makes Galia feel
insignificant.”

Luce’s attitude was still cold.

Nevertheless, aside from Isaac, Dorothy was the person who had talked to
Luce the most. Luce had a tendency to ignore what people said in the
first place.

It was probably because she saw Dorothy’s face often.

“Nihihi.”

Dorothy laughed innocently as she got off the bed and started heading
towards the doorway.

“That’s the end of this surveillance.”

“Already…? The academy said to watch me for three days…”

“It’s annoying!”

Dorothy’s short and concise answer convinced Luce in an instant.

“So, junior, you have to stay here quietly, okay?”

Dorothy flashed Luce a mischievous smile, opened the door and went out
into the hallway.

As Dorothy disappeared, the room fell silent. It was a dramatic shift in
atmosphere.

Finally, the nuisance was gone. Luce let out a deep sigh of relief.

*Plop.*

Luce laid down on the bed and quietly stared at the ceiling. Now that
she was alone, many thoughts began to fill her mind again.

Greung. He came to save her again. As expected, he was a man who had
concealed his identity with a Magic Cloak of Disguise, and it seemed
that the disguise had been undone as his cloak was damaged while
fighting the demons.

At that time, her vision was so blurred that she couldn’t make out his
appearance properly.

However, from the size of Greung’s hand that had touched her body and
the outline of his shoulders, Luce could only think of one man.

“Isaac…”

She wanted to hold Isaac’s hand right away and compare it to the size
and feel of Greung’s hand from her memory.

Of course, if she thought about it rationally, it was obvious that the
two people couldn’t be the same person.

Let’s assume that Isaac was a strong individual like Greung. Then how
could one explain Isaac’s mana capacity, magic skills, and the fact that
he trained so diligently every day?

‘But…’

Ice element. Hand size. Shoulder outline.

Luce, who could remember everything, wasn’t one to rely on intuition.
However, her intuition was screaming at her right now.

***I want to believe that Greung’s true identity is Isaac.***

Maybe she had felt this way since the class placement evaluation. The
intuition she had been continuously ignoring might have tried to
persuade Luce all along that Isaac was Greung.

Maybe that was why she felt so close to Isaac… she didn’t know.

“…”

Finally listening to her intuition, Luce quickly got off her bed and
headed towards the doorway.

She had been saved twice by that mysterious man. She couldn’t help but
be drawn to him.

Whenever she thought of him, the sound of her heart fiercely resonated,
piercing through the silence. Even for Luce, who had never built
relationships or interacted with people, it wasn’t that difficult to
recognize the nature of this unfamiliar emotion that she was
experiencing for the first time.

Her chest was throbbing. She felt like she was going crazy. Only by
finding out the identity of Greung could the turmoil inside her heart
subside.

Let’s quickly find out if Isaac was Greung. It was time to resolve the
conflict between reason and intuition, and calm the throbbing in her
chest.

Just as she was about to grab the doorknob…

*Charara─!*

“Ouch!”

Her hand stung, and she quickly stepped back. A brief cluster of stars
appeared and then faded into the doorknob.

A small note that was barely stuck under the doorknob fell to the floor
due to the shock from earlier. As she picked it up, a short sentence and
a drawn figure with a witch’s hat came into view.

\[Didn’t I tell you not to go out? Get some rest! I’ll bring you food!\]

A shadow appeared in the corner of Luce’s eyes. She clenched her fist
and ruthlessly crumpled the note.

Afterward, she tried to escape through the window, but it was to no
avail. Luce’s frustration grew even deeper.

Four days had passed since the end of the Thunderbird Subjugation and
Luce’s quarantine.

During this time, the academy’s staff gathered the students and
explained in detail what had happened during the end of semester
evaluation for the first-years of the Magic Department. They announced a
retest, however, bonus points would be rewarded to students who had
already passed the end of semester evaluation or had a Fell Card before
the incident took place.

Naturally, those who had already passed the evaluation objected, but
they reluctantly accepted the majority’s opinion that it was a dangerous
event that endangered the lives of the students. Well, that was the
power of the majority.

There was a retest in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ as well. It was
something I had already anticipated.

In any case, the first semester grades were determined by a combination
of the scores from the exams and the performance evaluations taken so
far. Because of this, it was a huge advantage to have bonus points while
retaking the same exam.

Of course, I was the one who received the most bonus points. However,
due to my surrender during the duel performance evaluation, it was
difficult to expect a good grade for the first semester.

And intuitively, I felt that the ice buff \[Black Ice\] imbued with
darkness mana did not go well with \[Ice Sovereign\].

In particular, it was difficult to use \[Black Ice\] on ice magic that
was 7-star or higher. It felt like forcibly connecting and operating
circuits that didn’t mesh well, it was simply inefficiency.

In other words, the cost-effectiveness of increasing the power of high
level magic wasn’t worth it.

Moreover, the mana consumption almost tripled. In other words, unless I
was in a short battle, it would be best to use \[Black Ice\] sparingly.

I invested 5 stat points in \[Physical Training Efficiency\] and 16
points in \[Learning Efficiency\] with the 21 new stat points I
acquired.

My elemental resistance increased by 10 for each element, thanks to
unlocking the achievement during the Thunderbird subjugation. The
minimum requirement to reach Hilde’s Frostscythe was an \[Ice Element
Resistance\] of 60 or more. With the Elemental Bracelet, I could now
surpass that threshold.

This was largely due to the early appearance of Leafa the Illusive, who
should have appeared in the second semester. I had planned to acquire it
before the end of the first year, but the condition to obtain it was met
before the second semester.

In other words, I plan to obtain Hilde’s Frostscythe, the ultimate ice
elemental weapon, during this vacation. Just by holding that legendary
weapon, the power of ice magic would be enhanced.

“Luce Eltania, are you ready?”

In broad daylight, on the beach.

The beach near Märchen Academy was so beautiful that it could be called
a closed tourist attraction. The fine white sand reflected the sunlight,
and the view of the emerald sea swaying was dazzling.

A female student was the only one dipping her feet in the water. Her
rose-gold hair fluttered in the sea breeze. It was Luce Eltania.

Under the watchful eyes of the academy’s staff, Luce nodded her head at
Professor Fernando’s question.

The academy had brought along high-ranking wizards and Dorothy
Heartnova, who was considered one of the strongest within the academy.
This was to ensure the safety of the 8-star familiar, Thunderbird Galia.
They needed to be prepared for any potential battles.

Currently, Luce had recovered enough mana to summon the Thunderbird. The
fact that she could summon an 8-star familiar in just four days after
being in a state of mana exhaustion meant that her mana recovery speed
was insanely fast.

And I, hidden behind a tree near the beach, secretly watched the scene
unfold.

Luce stretched her left arm out towards the sea.

Soon after, Professor Fernando instructed Luce to summon the Thunderbird
Galia.

The seal on Luce’s left wrist began to emit a purple light.

*Whooooosh── Kaboooom────!!!*

In an instant, dark clouds covered the sky, and purple thunder fiercely
roared.

From the purple lightning mana cluster that began to waver in the air
emerged the black Thunderbird. ‘Thunderbird Galia’ had revealed himself.

────────\[Squaaaaaaawk────!!\]

\[Thunderbird Galia\] **Lv:** 175

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[He is relieved that Luce Eltania seems to be fine.\]

Thunderbird Galia landed on the shallow water of the sea and locked eyes
with Luce.

While everyone held their breath, Luce seemed to be the only one who
showed anticipation.

Galia gently touched her cheek with the top of his large beak.

Then, Luce tenderly embraced Galia’s head.

“Why… did you come back only now… Why…?”

The normally blunt and cold Luce.

Had her head down and sobbed.

To Luce, Galia was the only being who shared memories of their time in
the candy house. Even though Hansel died and the Witch of the Candy
House also died, Galia had survived despite being cursed.

So, one of Luce’s dearest wishes was to restore Galia to his original
state.

That wish was now fulfilled, right here at this moment.

Galia lowered his eyes. After years of being engulfed by his destructive
instincts due to the Evil Dragon’s Curse, he must have felt extremely
sorry for the burden he had placed on Luce.

The academy staff silently watched Luce and the Thunderbird’s reunion.
Luce tightly hugged Galia for a while.

Someday, she would become a high-ranking Tower Master, wielding great
influence within the Empire and making history.

It was this moment, the realization of her dream to restore Galia, that
marked the beginning of that journey.

…

On a dark night, at Doris Hall, the dormitory for lower-ranked students.

I was drying my wet hair with a towel. I had just taken a shower after I
finished my daily training.

When I returned to my room, all sorts of idle thoughts that hadn’t
crossed my mind while training suddenly surfaced.

Among them, the most prevalent thought was undoubtedly about Kaya.

I wanted to convey my gratitude to her for using \[Tree of Radiance\],
even if indirectly.

However, Kaya seemed to be deliberately avoiding me as of late.

Well, it wasn’t in a bad way. According to \[Psychological Insight\],
she was always happy to see me.

She also blatantly blushed and looked embarrassed whenever she saw me.
It seemed like she had developed personal feelings for me as a man.

‘It’s probably because Kaya and I had experienced various things
together.’

I had a rough idea of when I dealt a fatal blow to Kaya’s heart. It must
have been when we went to the ant nest and during the end of semester
evaluation.

The day we went to defeat Garzia the Hermit, we had to sleep together,
which couldn’t be helped.

During the fierce battle at the end of semester evaluation, I handed
Kaya the Armana Wand from behind. I thought I had no choice since I was
desperate at the time…

It’s true that I was careless with someone who had no immunity to men. I
reflect on that.

Of course, if a girl as pretty as Kaya became my girlfriend, I’d be so
happy that I’d strip, do a grand jete^2^Grand Jete refers to a dance
move in ballet where the dancer does a leap in the air and kicks both
legs in opposite directions of each other, resulting in a sort of
mid-air split, a 360-degree headspin, and then show off an aerial
somersault while shouting “Hoo!” at the top of my lungs.

However, I was not in a situation where I could comfortably date
someone. At least not until I defeated the Evil God.

Moreover, there were various tangled threads of problems with Kaya that
needed to be resolved first.

In the first place, I wasn’t irresistibly attracted to Kaya. Deeply
dwelling on it now would only interfere with my training. So, I would
have to think about the Kaya issue later.

With that in mind, I got dressed.

「Water Generation (Water Element, ★1)」

*Splaaash──!*

“…?”

Suddenly, I heard the sound of water pouring from the window. It wasn’t
a sudden downpour. Someone had poured the water.

I walked over to the window and flung it wide open.

Outside the dormitory, under the moonlit night, a female student with
rose-gold hair and a tiny floating killer whale waved at me.

I never thought that Luce would come to see me personally…

Although it was summer, the night was still cool. I put on a thin coat
and left the dormitory.

On the roadside of Märchen Academy’s living quarters, a street composed
of glowing lamps illuminated Luce, who was standing on a macadam-style
street. She was wearing a one-piece dress with a cardigan.

As soon as Luce saw me, she unsummoned Bello and stood in a somewhat
humble posture. Her usual faint smile adorned her lips.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 150

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[She is happy to see you.\]

Luce Eltania’s level had skyrocketed. The status window had recalibrated
her power to be level 150.

Now that Galia had returned to his original state, she could fully
preserve her inherent lightning mana.

In other words, it would be more accurate to say that she had returned
to her original level. Luce was naturally very strong.

By the way, as a player leveled up, they received potential stats and
took less damage from lower level enemies.

However, other characters’ levels were simply based on their combat
abilities. The criteria for determining levels itself were inherently
different.

“It’s been a while, Luce. Is your quarantine over?”

Luce nodded her head.

“What’s going on?”

“I missed you, Isaac.”

For a moment, I took a deep breath. Sometimes, the words Luce casually
uttered dealt a fatal blow to my heart.

It wasn’t a statement made out of a desire to become lovers. Luce simply
had a style of fully opening her heart as soon as it opened a little, so
she was quite close to me. The only thing was that the barrier for entry
was extremely high.

Moreover, she had built walls in her relationship with others due to her
troubled past.

So, she had no grasp of how much psychological distance to maintain as a
friend, where to draw the line, and what things you shouldn’t say in a
friendship.

Therefore, I could understand and move past Luce’s unconscious flirting.

“Are you okay? I heard you went through a lot. I was worried, but I
couldn’t visit you because you were in quarantine.”

“…!”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[She is happy that you were worried
about her.\]

…It seemed like I needed to be more careful with my words as well.

“I-I’m okay. Isaac, I want to ask for a favor… Can you listen?”

Luce, who always started with dull remarks, seriously asked me for a
favor, which meant it was definitely an important request.

Luce must have gone through many significant emotional changes recently.
She had caused unintended harm to people due to the Thunderbird
Subjugation incident, and she had fulfilled her wish to return Galia to
his normal state. She must have been in the process of sorting out her
complicated feelings.

It was like that in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

“What favor?”

I was ready to help Luce with whatever she had to say.

***If I fulfill your request, I hope you can sort out your complicated
emotions and, as usual, give me dull remarks and talk about trivial
things.***

***So, I will do my best to fulfill whatever request you have.***

With that in mind, I paid close attention to what Luce would say next.

“…Can I hold your hand?”

*Chirp chirp─*

The sound of insects was loud. The silence was due to me being at a loss
for words.

Luce subtly extended her right hand. As if she wanted me to quickly hold
it. As I took in the sight of her slender and delicate hand, I couldn’t
even properly open my mouth.

I looked back at Luce, who avoided my gaze with her head lowered.

“I want to hold hands with Isaac.”

*On a summer night.*

*Her voice, as soft as the moonlight etched in the sky, tickled the
air.*

*I was reminded of how truly beautiful Luce’s voice was.*

*At that moment, my rationality faltered, and I couldn’t think of
anything.*

*All I could do was stare at Luce’s outstretched hand for a long time.*

*And there we stood, beneath the streetlight.*

*Oh so quietly, with our heads lowered.*

Chapter 49: - Hand
==================

༺ **Hand** ༻

The eastern region of Eltania County encompassed the stunning Allicar
Coast, which was considered one of the most beautiful places in all of
the Empire.

If one sat on the rooftop of the Eltania family mansion, one could take
in the entire view of Allicar Coast, which sparkled like jewels in the
sunlight.

At night, one could admire the coastal scenery that shimmered like
auroras; this was all thanks to the influx of blue bioluminescent
plankton.

However, when Luce was young, she didn’t favor the beauty of the day nor
the allure of the night, but the twilight that dwelled in between.

*When the edge of the setting sun gently kisses the horizon.*

*Even the sun, which illuminates the world equally, seems to fade away
so futilely.*

*And moreover, what of my brother Hansel, or the Witch of the Candy
House? Human life is truly fleeting.*

Luce’s eyes were lifeless. The thought of whether she could truly open
her heart to anyone ever again was too much for the young girl to bear.

But if there ever came a day when she opened her heart to someone again.

*At that time,*

*Don’t regret being unable to cherish that precious person more.*

*Don’t regret being unable to protect them.*

Luce used to mutter to herself as she gazed at the majestic light of the
setting sun.

\* \* \*

I regained my composure.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[She suspects that you are Greung.\]

\[Psychological Insight\] reveals a person’s current mental state. The
reason Luce asked to hold my hand was displayed in the status window.

Only then did I learn the reason Luce had come all this way.

When the Thunderbird Subjugation was over, I had caught Luce and held
her in a princess carry. At that time, my hand had touched her arms and
legs.

Luce was clearly intent on comparing Greung’s hand to mine.

‘Were you conscious then?’

At the time, I wasn’t fully conscious and my vision was blurry, so I
failed to notice. Luce wasn’t unconscious… It was a moment when my seven
years of experience playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was for naught.

The important thing was that I was still in the ‘suspicious’ phase. It
was evident that Luce had regained consciousness but wasn’t able to
clearly observe my appearance.

I could tell by the way she eagerly tried to hold my hand to discern
whether I was Greung or not.

Moreover, it seemed that Galia was doing an excellent job at keeping my
secret like he said he would in Midheaven Realm. It was a bit worrying,
but luckily, that guy had some tact.

“Why do you want to hold my hand all of a sudden?”

“Just…”

“Luce, you should only hold hands with the person you like, not a friend
of the opposite sex…”

I spoke in an old-fashioned tone to dissipate the subtle atmosphere that
Luce had created.

Did you know about Socrates’ famous method of refutation^1^Socrates’
famous method of refutation (also referred to as Elenchus) was a method
that Socrates himself developed to put someone’s social skills “to the
test”. He would use this dialectal method to reveal someone’s social
skills or lack thereof.? When I usually pointed out something like this,
Luce would argue with me by asking ‘Why?’, ‘Why?’, ‘Why?’.

For this reason, I usually refrained from pointing things out, but this
time it couldn’t be helped. I needed to adopt a conservative mindset to
overcome this crisis.

“We’ve already held hands before…”

The moment I heard that line, I realized I didn’t need to explain to
Luce why male and female friends shouldn’t hold hands.

She seemed to know what it meant for a man and a woman to hold hands.

“Don’t you have someone you like?”

I cut off Luce’s words.

“…I think I do.”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[She feels excited while thinking
about Greung.\]

It was over. Greung was confirmed to be on Luce’s lover’s route. Now, if
it was revealed that I was Greung, I would be seriously screwed.

Moreover, Luce’s lover’s route was activated on the condition that the
player saved her during the class placement evaluation.

I had perfectly nailed Luce’s lover route on myself by saving her during
the Thunderbird subjugation.

Luce was the kind of character who would suffer a fatal blow to her
heart if she was saved, even if it was just once. Since I had saved her
twice now… once her crush’s identity was revealed, her heart would race
like a runaway train.

But thanks to Luce sincerely revealing her true feelings, the situation
was now in my favor.

“Is it me?”

“It’s not you… maybe…”

I deliberately continued talking as if I hadn’t heard Luce whisper
‘maybe’,

“If it’s not me, then… Well, anyways, it’s something to celebrate, but
then why do you want to hold hands with me so badly? And what was that
‘just’ about?”

I calmly pressed Luce. It was an inevitable situation.

If the fact that I was Greung was revealed, Extra Bad Ending No.13 would
suddenly come crashing down like the Grim Reaper.

I couldn’t just end my friendship with Luce either. It was already too
late for that.

***Let’s try and think about it. If I hastily deny or try to overturn
the fact that I’m not Greung, it would only arouse Luce’s suspicion.***

Luce had a brain that could remember everything. In other words, if she
saw any inconsistencies in my behavior, she would undoubtedly
investigate, and I would inevitably be caught as Greung.

So, what should I do? Avoidance would be best.

The key was to keep Luce in a state of ambiguous doubt, wondering
whether Isaac and Greung were the same person or not.

As long as she didn’t gain complete certainty, I could just prevent
Luce’s heart from firmly directing her feelings towards me.

Slowly, very slowly. Let’s gradually accumulate enough evidence through
inductive reasoning to convince her that I wasn’t Greung.

At least until I defeated the Evil God Nephid.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, if one followed Luce’s lover’s route and
defeated the Evil God Nephid, there was an ending scene where Luce and
the protagonist would have a happy family life.

Putting the happy family life with Luce aside. The important thing was
that by the time one defeated the Evil God Nephid, the risk of facing
Extra Bad Ending No. 13 would disappear.

“It isn’t okay to play with the feelings of others…”

As I rubbed the back of my neck and spoke in a disappointed tone, Luce
raised her head and showed a troubled expression.

“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…”

There was a faint whimper in Luce’s voice.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[She is worried about being hated by
you.\]

I felt guilty.

***I’m sorry for pushing you away, but my situation isn’t easy…***

“No, I was too harsh. I’m sorry.”

“…”

“But since we’re already here, let’s stay a little longer and chat by
the lake over there…”

I thought I had successfully changed the subject. I also quickly came up
with a plan to distract Luce with various stories.

So, as I was about to move my feet and gradually execute that plan.

The moment I turned around and started to move my feet, I felt a weight
in my right hand.

The smooth touch of her skin ran through my fingers.

Surprised, I stopped and looked back.

Luce was holding my hand.

“…I didn’t plan on asking for permission. I just thought that it would
be better to hold your hand… even if it meant being hated a little.”

Luce said so in a lonely tone and dug her delicate and slender fingers
into the spaces between my fingers.

“You have calluses^2^calluses-a rough, thickened area of skin that
appears because of repeated irritation or pressure to an area of skin.”

The air grew heavy.

Luce raised her head.

Only the sound of insects was loud. The light from the street composed
of glowing lamps engulfed the moonlight and brightly shined upon us.

Under that bright light, Luce looked at me, her eyes shadowed by her
bangs, and asked.

“You… are Greung, right?”

Extra Bad Ending No.13 「Bird Cage」.

That ending occurred when Luce’s affection gauge for the protagonist
broke a certain threshold.

Luce, unable to control her emotions, confined the protagonist after she
kidnapped him and took care of him with utmost devotion.

She fed him every day, washed him, embraced him, and showered him with
kisses.

She whispered her hidden feelings in a tender voice.

─’I love you, ■■■.’

─’I like you. I love you, I really love you…’

As time flowed relentlessly within Luce’s love, the Evil God Nephid was
resurrected, bringing about the destruction of the world.

I was someone who had saved Luce twice despite knowing about her hidden
and dark tendencies.

With that in mind, I had to do whatever it took to avoid being caught as
the true identity of Greung.

My relationship with Luce was one of friendship.

Even if there were slightly strange vibes due to Luce’s unfamiliarity
with boundaries, it was just right for us to be able to say with
certainty, ‘We’re friends.’

“What’s that?”

“I asked, are you Greung…?”

“How do you do that?”

“…?”

I immediately went into acting mode and played dumb.

During my school days, I had aspired to be an actor and had tried a wide
range of plays. I took pride in my acting skills and considered them to
be top-notch.

Luce seemed puzzled by my expression, as if she didn’t understand why I
didn’t know anything.

“The black monster. You already know what I’m talking about.”

“That…? Why do you call that ‘Greung’?”

“Because he told me so… Are you really not Greung?”

“Idiot.”

Luce was taken aback, and shook her head. It seemed that the expression
‘idiot’, which she had never heard before, had provoked her.

“How can I be that monster? Would I be struggling every day if I was?”

I was just Isaac, who trained hard every day. She wouldn’t be oblivious
to this fact.

***…Is it just my imagination that I feel a bit sad?***

“…”

Luce stared at me with a meaningful gaze.

However, there was no way she could find even a trace of imperfection in
my acting.

My facial expressions and gestures were all perfect.

“I see…”

“Sorry for the misunderstanding.”

Luce lowered her eyes. It seemed like she had conceded.

I wasn’t sure how accurately she had felt the touch of my hand during
the Thunderbird Subjugation.

But judging from the fact that she couldn’t be sure I was Greung even
after reacting to the calluses, it was safe to say that she didn’t feel
a distinct touch.

Besides, there was no need to seriously convince her, I just needed to
remind her of the difference in mana and skill between Greung and me.

Luce would also consider that judgment to be reasonable. She wasn’t an
idiot who would jump to the conclusion that I had reached the realm of
an Archwizard.

However, this alone wasn’t enough to completely dispel her suspicion.
Luce had developed feelings for Greung, so doubts lingered like embers
of a flame. At the slightest clue, her suspicion would flare up fiercely
once again.

I could never let my guard down.

“But it’s quite novel to like such a monster. I wonder if I should say
that’s just like you Luce… I’m curious about what happened. Why don’t
you tell me about it from over there…”

“Isaac.” Luce said while suddenly interrupting me.

“Uh, yes?”

***What now?***

For some reason, Luce looked like a shy girl, blushing and hanging her
head.

As I watched her fidget with her fingers, I had an ominous feeling.

‘Keep calm.’

There was no difference from before. No matter what challenges I had to
face, I would calmly overcome them.

Soon, Luce’s oceanic eyes looked straight into mine.

“Could you, by any chance, teach me how to be in a relationship?”

***This…***

***…seems like it will be quite a tough battle.***

Chapter 50: - Summer Vacation Ceremony
======================================

**༺ Summer Vacation Ceremony ༻**

“We shall now proceed with the summer vacation ceremony for the first
year students of the Magic Department.”

The end-of-semester retest consisted of several elemental magic tests.
It was very small compared to the traditional end-of-semester
evaluation’s scale, but it was also the most intuitive.

Thus, the first semester came to a close. The total grade for the first
semester was the sum of all grades from the exams and performance
evaluations taken thus far.

I was ranked 230th out of 300 students. Well, it was expected. I had
received very low scores for my Grade E mana at the start of the
semester, and I had no choice but to surrender during the duel.

But I still had my sights set on being the top seat. Grades were an
important indicator of how much stronger I had become, after all.

Under the blue sky, large groups of fluffy clouds leisurely drifted
across the scenery. Amidst the chirping of birds, the first-year
students of the Magic Department belatedly held their summer vacation
ceremony.

In the square, students were seated in chairs that were neatly arranged
beforehand.

Headmistress Elena, a beautiful woman in her 70s who retained the
appearance of her 20s due to the effects of her passive \[Immortality\],
gave a speech.

As the top seat of the first semester of the first year, Luce Eltania
came forward as the student representative and read the declaration.

While doing so, she discreetly glanced my way and let out a gentle smile
whenever she had a chance.

However, the male students around me blushed as if they had seen
something pleasant, and sent envious and jealous gazes my way. I had
grown used to it by now.

‘What to do…?’

My worries surfaced again, all because of a recent dilemma I had taken
on.

I asked her how she found out about Greung, and after listening to the
story I already knew, I gave her some clichéd relationship advice. I was
sweating internally, trying my best to hide the fact that I was Greung.

Well, Luce’s story aside.

I had a lot of things to do over the break.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was a widely recognized god-tier game. Due to
its vast content and story, as well as the various interactions between
objects and huge open-world map that felt like one big world, it had
been loved by many users for a long time.

‘Once I go outside, there’ll be plenty of content.’

During the break, I heard from Amy that Ian Fairytale planned to enjoy
content like the guild quests outside the academy.

The Evil God wouldn’t be able to track Ian after he leaves the academy.
That was why the demons couldn’t be informed about the ‘Child of Light’s
whereabouts. Other light element wielders like the Saintess weren’t
attacked by demons for similar reasons.

In the first place, an astronomical amount of mana was consumed to send
it into the abyss and awaken the demons one by one. The Evil God must be
struggling with that one task alone.

***So, I hope Ian enjoys his summer vacation to the fullest.***

‘I’ll just go look for Hilde’s Frostscythe.’

Thanks to obtaining the Elemental Bracelet, my plans were pushed
forward. I could now search for the ultimate ice elemental weapon,
Hilde’s Frostscythe.

If things went well, I might be able to get my hands on my second
ultimate elemental weapon before I even became a second-year student.

‘Awesome.’

I could already feel the pressure from the intense “Floating Island”
scenario easing.

The ‘Floating Island’ scenario was a chapter that caused many users to
feel regret because of Dorothy’s death.

Although she was already cursed to die within a year, she ended up dying
even sooner because the demons had accelerated her curse.

It was a very heartbreaking chapter for me, as Dorothy was my favorite
character.

‘I won’t let Dorothy die.’

Of course, Dorothy would also be a great help in preventing bad endings
in the future.

In the first place, Dorothy was my favorite character. That reason alone
was enough to save her.

Achieving my goals through gritted teeth and sheer determination was my
specialty, after all. Whether it was the ‘Floating Island’ chapter or
anything else, I would definitely save my favorite character.

In order to do that, I would have to train hard during this break.

…

On the way back from the end-of-semester ceremony.

Most students were busily preparing to return to their hometowns right
away. Since the first-year students of the Magic Department had their
break delayed by nine days, they must have been feeling impatient and
discontent.

***Come to think of it, there won’t be many students around during the
break. I can have the training ground all to myself. Hell yeah!***

Quite a few students would be leaving tomorrow, so I had to do my
training as usual today.

Starting tomorrow, it would be better to go to the training ground.

“…….”

Was it because I had just finished a hectic semester and was now
welcoming the break? I suddenly felt a sense of unfamiliarity.

I stopped and looked down at my right hand. The now familiar hand shape
entered my sight.

Isaac. I had taken over this weak man with silver-blue hair, red eyes,
and an otaku-like appearance. I didn’t know where Isaac’s hometown was,
who his family was, or what kind of upbringing he had.

***Is it proper etiquette to somehow find out Isaac’s personal
information and visit his family at least once?***

‘Now that I think about it…’

As I thought about it, a question surfaced in my mind.

‘Isaac, why did you enroll here?’

I knew why Ian had enrolled at Märchen Academy. It was to graduate from
the best academy and become a prestigious magic knight.

Ian’s E-rank mana was due to an upbringing that couldn’t properly awaken
his talents. Nevertheless, he had thoroughly honed his swordsmanship
skills in order to become a knight.

But what about Isaac, who also had E-rank mana?

‘If becoming a wizrd was his goal, why did he only focus on academics
instead of magic training?’

At the beginning of the first semester, during the mana evaluation,
Professor Fernando said that Isaac had received excellent grades in the
theoretical field.

***But why?***

Overcoming E-rank mana wasn’t that difficult. Even if he had no talent,
he would have somehow surpassed the E rank if he had diligently trained
his magic. Was he really aiming to be just a scholar? If so, wasn’t the
distribution of effort too extreme?

Isaac must have passed the academy’s entrance exam with only theoretical
skills. It felt like he deliberately focused on the ‘part he could do
best’.

It was as if… he hadn’t come to Märchen Academy to ‘become a successful
wizard’, but had ‘some reason to enter Märchen Academy’. There was a
strange possibility.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Isaac was an undeniable extra. In other
words, it’s not because he was a hidden mastermind or an important
figure who could influence the scenario.

‘Something seems to be on the tip of my tongue… Ah.’

Suddenly, a silver-haired female student came to mind. One of the NPCs
with no story importance, she was a character with a mental disorder
that seemed a bit sociopathic.

It somehow felt like Isaac was related to that NPC. However, the
silver-haired girl was just one of the passing NPCs, so I could not
clearly recall the dialogue.

Was it just my imagination? I didn’t know. I could be overthinking it
because I’m feeling sensitive.

While mulling over my thoughts, I headed to the Butterfly Garden.

“Sir Isaac!”

On the deserted garden path, a sudden gust of green wind brushed past my
skin.

Along with a familiar voice, a female student wrapped in wind magic
landed in front of me.

Her light green twin-tails fluttered in the wind.

Ranked second in total points for the first semester, the second seat,
Kaya Astrean.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 97

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[She is happy to see your face.\]

“Kaya?”

I hadn’t expected her to suddenly come to me because she had recently
been avoiding me.

She had acquired the plant element. Well, that was only natural.

Now that I thought about it, she didn’t even ask me about the Armana
Wand. I had already prepared an answer to that.

“I-I-I came to say thank you!”

She was so nervous that her voice trembled like an earthquake.

“Because of the wand?”

“Yes, yes…!”

Although it was quite late, I never expected to receive any gratitude.
If anything, I should be the one thanking her.

“Don’t worry about it. It was something you needed, so I gave it to
you.”

“Do you… care about me?”

I didn’t bother to answer. It was true that I cared.

Kaya blushed, taking my silence as a positive response.

“Actually…! I’ll be returning to my family soon. So, I won’t be able to
see you during the break, and I came to say goodbye…!”

“How did you find me?”

“Well, I saw you while I was flying in the sky.”

Kaya was dressed in elegant brown clothes. She must have wanted to meet
me before leaving the academy.

“So, what I wanted to say is…!”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[She is in trouble because her mind
has gone blank.\]

In short, she came to see my face and express her gratitude before
leaving.

I was delighted. I was genuinely grateful to Kaya.

***Because of you, I’m here now.***

“So, what I was trying to say…!”

Kaya stared at my face with wide open eyes.

Here, in the corner of the Butterfly Garden, the street was lined with
mahogany. Befitting its name, the flower beds scattered around and the
butterflies dancing in the garden were quite refreshing.

Kaya’s ladylike demeanor blended well with the scenery. She looked
lovely.

The corners of my mouth unconsciously rose. She was the person I owed
the most in the first semester, the one who saved my life with the
\[Tree of Radiance\], after all.

Eventually, I realized that my expression was the first genuine smile I
had ever shown Kaya. I suddenly noticed that I hadn’t smiled at her
much.

“Have a great break, Kaya.”

I approached Kaya and patted her shoulder.

As I was about to head to my usual training spot in the corner of the
butterfly garden.

*Chuu.*

An unexpected attack hit me. Something soft touched my right cheek for a
moment, making a cute sound as it passed by.

Startled, I tried to maintain my composure and looked to the side.

“I-I…”

Kaya was trembling, her face turning an even deeper shade of red. Her
complexion had completely changed.

Steam was rising endlessly above her head, her eyes spinning round and
round.

It seemed she had belatedly realized what she had done while failing to
suppress her instincts.

“I’ve committed a grave sin───!!!”

Dadadadada─!

Kaya ran away as fast as she could. It was a sprint in high heels.

She wrapped wind magic around her feet and fiercely cut through the air.
Her figure somewhat resembled a bullet.

For a while, I stood still, gazing at the spot Kaya had left while
touching the cheek she kissed.

I didn’t expect the shy girl to be so bold.

“…”

I must have been… really surprised.

\* \* \*

Inside the luxurious carriage of the Carnedas family that was departing
from the academy.

“Lady Ciel, is there something bothering you?”

The carriage was crossing the great bridge and passing near the Kalis
Mountain Range.

Emma, the armor-clad exclusive escort knight of the Carnedas family,
asked Ciel with a doubtful expression. They were riding in the same
carriage.

Ciel would usually have been napping at this time of day. However, for
some reason, she was lost in deep thought, propping her chin on her hand
and staring intently out of the window.

What had she experienced at the academy? A Ciel who didn’t nap was no
different from an unknown person to Emma.

“Just…”

Ciel replied in her usual weak voice.

“I’m just realizing how vast the world is.”

“…?”

Emma couldn’t understand Ciel’s response. She wasn’t usually fond of the
concept of ‘appreciation’.

Had the academy life full of youth and the scent of flowers changed
Ciel?

Or… had she become so deeply troubled that even her naptime had been
affected?

Feeling an unnecessary tension, Emma repeatedly swallowed her dry
saliva.

Ciel’s mind was on Isaac.

The boy with silver-blue hair had deceived Ciel about his mana capacity
and pretended to be weak. However, wizards were not existences that
could act weak just because they wanted to.

Because of mana perception, one could sense the wizard’s mana circuit
and roughly estimate their amount of mana when they use magic.

That was why Ciel quickly realized that Isaac was weak.

However, during the final exam, he pinpointed the locations of Fell
Cards. He demonstrated an enormous mana perception ability that didn’t
match his mana capacity.

It was truly a contradiction.

But during the Thunderbird Subjugation, the contradiction was resolved
when Isaac was revealed as a powerful being.

And the fact that such a powerful being could hide their mana meant that
they had reached the realm of an archwizard at such a young age – an
unbelievable conclusion.

Historically, there has never been such a prodigy. In other words, if it
became known that a person of Ciel’s age like Isaac had reached the
realm of an archwizard.

‘The world would be turned upside down.’

Putting aside the royal family, the world itself would have its eyes on
Isaac. Everything in the world would compete to win his heart.

‘But that guy is hiding his identity…’

It had been concluded that the black monster that caused a stir at the
academy was a demon who had betrayed its own kind.

It was because he appeared at the right time and place whenever a demon
appeared.

And because he used ice magic wrapped in darkness mana, which only
demons could use.

In the first place, he didn’t even look human from the outside.

As such, Ciel had no objections to the idea that the black monster was a
unique type of demon.

However, after learning that Isaac was the monster, she could finally
think of the possibility of a ‘Magic Cloak of Disguise’.

The enemy of an enemy is a friend, as they say. Even so, the academy
side was not letting their guard down against the black monster.

***Before all of that, why did Isaac hide his mana?***

Although she didn’t know the reason, it was certain that Isaac was
secretly struggling to protect the people of the academy.

In that case, it would be much better to work with the academy side to
stop the demons.

But for some reason, Isaac wasn’t doing that.

‘Is it because of an informant?’

During the dueling evaluation, Professor Fernando found out from the
demons that there was an ‘informant’ within the academy. It was a fact
that could be learned by looking at the investigation records posted by
the Truth Investigation Committee on the Orphin Hall bulletin board.

In other words, that informant was involved in the academy’s
administration.

If Isaac was in a position where he would be in trouble if he got caught
by that person, the situation before and after fit like puzzle pieces.

Behind the scenes, unknown to the academy students, including Ciel.

A dangerous confrontation between Isaac and the informant was unfolding.

Ciel didn’t want to get involved in such a complicated and dangerous
situation. However, the Märchen Academy diploma was necessary for her to
live comfortably, so dropping out wasn’t even an option. Other students
must have had similar thoughts.

‘Then… I should have that class D guy protect me. But I shouldn’t
carelessly provoke him.’

As a result, all incidents were resolved by protecting the secret that
‘Isaac is actually strong’.

And according to the information received from the Carnedas family’s
informant.

Now that the Imperial Knights were getting involved in Märchen Academy,
if the informant was revealed at this time…

‘Will my academy life be worry-free?’

An informant siding with the demons and causing harm to people.

Isaac, who was defeating demons and protecting people.

It was clear without a doubt which side to take.

Chapter 51: - Prologue (1)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (1) ༻**

In the afternoon of the school’s vacation ceremony, thick raindrops
started to pour down heavily. The clouds that I had initially mistaken
for cumulus turned out to be nimbostratus clouds.

In the end, I had to cut my training short and make my way back to Doris
Hall.

After being washed by the rain, I decided to sort out my plans for the
future and put them into action. Since summer vacation had arrived, I
thought it was a good idea to solidify my plans.

I took a seat at my desk, spread out a sheet of paper, dipped my quill
in ink, and began writing them down.

‘First, there’s the matter of next semester’s tuition fees.’

Each semester’s tuition fee was 50,000 gel. I had the option to use
external funds converted to gel, which were limited to tuition purposes,
or I could pay directly with gel.

I had earned a significant amount of gel by selling the zephrim I had
obtained in large quantities from the Tantak underground cave.

However, I made a significant expenditure when I bought the Armana Wand,
so my current amount of gel was a bit short compared to the tuition
fees.

Considering the cost of living during the vacation, I needed to dedicate
some time to earning more gel.

I was aware of a part-time job that increased \[Elemental Efficiency\].
If I took that job during the vacation and combined the gel I earned
with the ones I already had, I should be able to cover my tuition fees.
The fact that it also helped with my training would be an added bonus.

‘For my vacation schedule…’

Excluding the part-time job hours, my vacation schedule would be filled
with continuous training. Enjoying external academy content can help me
grow, but repetitive training is still the most efficient way.

If it weren’t for my status window, I would have been Isaac, the weakest
student, lagging far behind everyone else in terms of growth speed. I
needed to become stronger with maximum efficiency.

‘So, it will be a continuous cycle of a boring part-time job and
training. Then, what’s left is the…’

Hilde’s Frostscythe, which could be considered the major highlight of
this summer vacation.

During the break, I would have a chance to get my hands on the legendary
weapon I wanted within my first year.

In order to obtain Hilde’s Frostscythe, I must pass a trial consisting
of mental challenges. It would take place in a non-reality setting, so I
simply needed to overcome whatever obstacles came my way.

Since the content of the trial varied from person to person, the trial
that I experienced as Ian in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ would be quite
different from the one that I would encounter as Isaac.

‘I’m not sure if my game knowledge will be helpful.’

I would have to stay within the cold aura emitted by the Frostscythe
until the trial was over.

That was why the minimum requirement for obtaining the Frostscythe was
to raise \[Ice Resistance\] to at least 60, as it represented ‘the
minimum threshold to withstand the cold until the trial is over’.

In other words, if I couldn’t pass the trial before my body reached its
limits, I would die.

‘…Isn’t that dangerous?’

As the time to obtain the Frostscythe drew near, the realization that I
could potentially die from this endeavor hit me hard. It felt even more
significant because I had already experienced how death was not a
distant possibility while fighting with the Thunderbird.

Besides, I was good at hunting demons, but when it came to trials, I was
just an ordinary Isaac…

“Still… If I get this, I’ll be able to power up.”

Risking my life had enough merit. I didn’t know how to handle weapons,
but simply holding Hilde’s Frostscythe would amplify the power of ice
magic. I could use it like a wizard uses a staff.

In other words, if I activated \[Ice Sovereign\] and held Hilde’s
Frostscythe, it would result in the birth of the strongest Isaac. The
Isaac Coin would soar all the way to Mars.

Of course, I couldn’t properly handle the \[Ice Sovereign\] skill yet.
As the ultimate ice element passive skill, it would be strange if I
could already use it well.

Additionally, Hilde’s Frostscythe had side effects. The more the weapon
was used, the more it eroded the user’s body with its cold aura.
However, this will gradually become less of a problem as I grow
stronger.

Well, it wasn’t like \[Ice Sovereign\], which he couldn’t handle at all.
So that was something.

“I should prepare some cold protection gear.”

Surprisingly, all the ultimate elemental weapons were located in Märchen
Academy.

‘In the future, when the Evil God of the Apocalypse is resurrected, and
the end of the world approaches, a brave hero will emerge to stop the
Evil God.’

This was a glimpse of the future seen by the archwizards of each
element, collectively known as the ‘Primordial Elemental Kings.’
Naturally, the hero referred to in the prophecy was none other than the
protagonist Ian Fairytale, the Child of Light.

The Primordial Elemental Kings had decided to help the hero from the
distant future. However, the future was uncertain, so they could not
determine which element the hero would use to stop the Evil God.

As a result, they decided to leave behind the ultimate weapons for each
element. They chose Märchen Academy, where the hero would awaken his
true potential.

‘That setting is introduced in the second semester of the second year.’

In other words, Ian would obtain the ultimate weapons of each element
during the second semester of his second year. Well, everything else was
fine. I just hoped that he would cooperate well with Ciel later and
obtain the Luminous Sword safely when the time came.

Now, my task was clear. I had to find the hidden pieces scattered
throughout ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, namely the ‘Traces of the Ice
Sovereign’. There were a total of four such items.

After finding all four ‘Traces of the Ice Sovereign’ and placing my hand
on a certain magic circle in the Ayla Forest,

If I declared, ‘I will face the Trial of Frost’, I would automatically
be transported to the trial location.

‘As for the preparations…’

I made a list of things to prepare, such as clothes, cold protection
gear, and fire element hand warmers. To endure the trial, I first needed
to keep my body warm.

As I wrote, my left hand that held the parchment caught my eye.

A black seal etched into my wrist, the ‘8-star Familiar Contract
Circle’.

I lifted my left hand to examine the seal closely. It had the same shape
as the 8-star Familiar Contract Circle I was familiar with. However,
nothing was inscribed in it, only displaying a dull black color.

At first glance, it appeared to be just an ordinary tattoo – it didn’t
disappear, nor did I feel anything from it.

After seeing my fate, the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath had bestowed
upon me this contract circle as the most essential gift.

If the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath had foretold my involvement with an
8-star magic beast, then there could be no other creature but that one.

‘Frost Dragon Hilde…’

The Frost Dragon guarding the Frostscythe.

An 8-star ice magic beast, ‘Frost Dragon-Hilde’.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, all the creatures guarding the ultimate
weapons were 8-star magic beasts.

In the later stages of the game, obtaining an 8-star Familiar Contract
Circle allowed you to form a contract with an 8-star magic beast that
matched your element.

There were two conditions that must be met. First, you must have
obtained the ultimate weapon. Second, you must defeat the 8-star magic
beast and prove that you are stronger.

In order to make ‘Frost Dragon Hilde’ mine, I must not only pass the
trial and obtain the Frostscythe, but also defeat them.

However, unlike demons, it was a pure magic beast. This meant that, I
had to face it with the body of an ordinary Isaac, with the \[Hunter\]
trait deactivated.

‘It’s impossible.’

There was no way I could win. I had almost died fighting the 8-star
familiar Thunderbird Galia, with \[Hunter\] trait activated. And that
was when its health was already significantly reduced.

How could I, as ordinary Isaac, defeat a full-health 8-star magic beast,
Frost Dragon Hilde? No matter how I thought about it, it seemed like an
impossible feat.

However… I couldn’t think of any other 8-star magic beasts besides the
Frost Dragon.

‘What did that witch see in my fate?’

Could it be that she just gave me something random that was within her
reach?

…I decided to put those thoughts aside and go search for the four
‘Traces of the Ice Sovereign’ items.

With a vague recollection of where they were, I was filled with
excitement at the prospect of spending the entire day scouring the
academy for them.

I placed the quill pen down on the parchment where I had written my
plans, stood up from the desk chair, and changed into comfortable navy
blue sportswear along with a raincoat.

After that, I left the room.

\* \* \*

For a thousand years, snow had been falling and dancing in the air, even
in midsummer, defying the climate of the Whiteclark Duchy which covered
the northern region.

The reason behind it was the swirling ice mana that enveloped the Eiffel
Mountain Range, which stood at 9,000 meters.

An ice elemental archwizard called Primordial Ice Elemental King, Ice
Sovereign, and Witch with the Scythe, had battled against ancient demons
to protect the northern region. At that time, the summoned majestic form
of the archwizard’s 8-star magic beast, ‘Frost Dragon Hilde’, became the
symbol of the Whiteclark family, the ‘White Dragon Emblem’.

Keridna Whiteclark, a pink-haired female student belonging to Class A at
Märchen Academy, returned to her mansion and greeted her parents.

In a hurry, she entered her room and locked the door.

When the maids outside the door offered to prepare a bath, she was
blatantly embarrassed, stuttering, “Uh, um…!”

“Hehehehehe…”

After the maid left, Keridna was dripping cold sweat and started
laughing like a villain. It was a habit she had developed in her
childhood, believing it made her look cool.

“That commoner got served. He dared to ignore me.”

It was during the vacation ceremony before she left the academy to
return home.

Keridna took advantage of the crowded scene to brush past Isaac, the
silver-blue haired male student from Class D, and planted a spell on
him.

The Whiteclark bloodline ability, \[Sight Synchronization\]. It was a
unique magic exclusive to the direct bloodline of the Whiteclark family,
similar to Amy Holloway’s \[Heart Color Discernment\] magic.

By casting the spell on a specific person, one could see and store in
their memory the scenes that appeared in the target’s field of view,
regardless of the distance between them.

Since the mana consumption increased with distance, continuously
observing the target’s field of vision was challenging. Keridna’s sister
had advised her to intermittently check the target’s sight instead.

Keridna’s sister, Aichel Whiteclark, contributed to the power struggles
of the Whiteclark family by monitoring the vision of about 20 key
figures, excluding royalty, using this ability. Although the
consequences of being caught could be severe, potentially leading to the
downfall of the Whiteclark family, no incidents had occurred so far.

She was a bold sister.

And she seemed to be hiding something.

Anyway, \[Sight Synchronization\] had never been discovered by others.
Its unique characteristic of not emitting mana made it undetectable.
Detecting the \[Sight Synchronization\] spell was only possible when
targeting someone from the Whiteclark family who utilized the spell.

Ultimately, \[Sight Synchronization\] was a major factor in the
Whiteclark family’s rise to power as a ducal family and their success in
power struggles.

Keridna had used this kind of magic for personal purposes. She
absolutely couldn’t be caught, as her parents would be furious if they
found out.

“What’s so special about that commoner that everyone’s making a fuss
about?”

The silver-blue haired Class D commoner. During this break, she would
uncover all of his secrets.

Keridna valued connections. As soon as she joined Class A, she tried to
be friendly with her fellow students. It was evident that a good network
would greatly benefit her in the future.

Although her performance during this first semester was somewhat
lackluster.

By taking a peek into the life of the mysterious Class D commoner who
was associated with the top students—top seat Luce Eltania, second seat
Kaya Astrean, and third seat Ciel Carnedas—

She might find valuable hints to create new connections.

‘No, I didn’t use \[Sight Synchronization\] for personal purposes. It
was all to solidify my social status. Ultimately, it was for the
Whiteclark family!’

Keridna expanded her thoughts in this manner, justifying her actions to
herself.

Outside the window, the view was enveloped in darkness. In the
Whiteclark duchy, it snowed for 340 days a year, and today, Keridna saw
a gently falling snowscape.

What could the mysterious Class D male student be doing now?

Keridna sat down at her spacious desk, closed her eyes, and focused.

A damp space. Falling water. Isaac’s sight was dim.

***Is he… taking a shower?***

Suddenly, Isaac’s upper body was reflected in the mirror. His body was…
better than she had expected.

‘Something, something…’

She felt like the sight healed her eyes. Was the commoner’s body really
this good? It was surprising.

“Hu, uh, um…”

Gradually, the fact that she was peeking into someone’s private life in
real-time started causing her to feel guilty and depraved. It was an act
that deserved moral condemnation.

Then, as Isaac’s gaze started moving downwards.

Keridna was taken aback, quickly opened her eyes, cutting off the
\[Sight Synchronization\] magic. She didn’t have the courage to see what
came next.

“Heavens, this is what the spell does…?”

Keridna panted. It was her first time using this bloodline magic.

To have felt such a psychological burden from just briefly looking into
someone’s vision… She thought she would die of embarrassment.

Her sister, who usually monitored 20 nobles, must have witnessed all
kinds of things.

‘Sister, what kind of battles have you been through…?’

Keridna never imagined that she would feel this kind of admiration for
her sister, Aichel Whiteclark.

*Flinch.* Keridna quickly looked around the room, making sure that there
was no one around.

It was because Aichel frequently appeared out of nowhere, she needed to
be extra cautious.

“Should I continue looking? …No.”

Keridna shook her head. The other person was in the shower. Even when
using \[Sight Synchronization\], there were ethical and moral boundaries
that had to be respected.

Despite having already invaded Isaac’s privacy, Keridna attempted to
alleviate her guilt with such thoughts.

Did the Whiteclark family turn a blind eye to such guilt in order to
maintain their power?

It was an unexpectedly thought-provoking night.

\* \* \*

The traces of the Ice Sovereign were faintly glowing blue magic stones,
divided into four pieces.

It took a full three days to find them all. It was a humbling
experience, making me realize how ambitious it was to think that they
could be found in just a day.

The first piece was found in a cave on the Neishin Coast.

The second piece was found inside a tree in Josena Forest, which took an
entire day to locate, from morning to night, because I had the vaguest
memory of it.

The third piece was found inside a book in the ancient books section of
the library. Since I knew the title of the book, it didn’t take long.

The last, fourth piece was found in Changgung Park, a park on a mountain
with a panoramic view of the Märchen Academy.

Each time an item was found, a system window appeared saying something
like \[Congratulations! You have found \[First Trace of the Ice
Sovereign\]!\] There was no doubt that these were the traces of the Ice
Sovereign.

At one point, when Luce asked, “Isaac, what are you doing?” I casually
brushed her off by saying I was exercising. She had decided to stay at
the academy during the break.

*─ ‘Isaac, are you going home for the holidays?’*

*─ ‘No, what about you?’*

*─ ‘I was thinking of not going since you’re not going.’*

*─ ‘…???’*

She said there was no reason to leave, as the person she cared for was
at the academy, not at the Eltania mansion.

It was a headache-inducing explanation.

In the evening.

As soon as I found the fourth magic stone, I headed straight to Ayla
Forest. It was a forest that appeared after crossing Josena Forest,
which was right in front of the Märchen Academy’s main entrance, and
following a long valley.

The trees entwined with ice mana, emitting a bluish-green hue, added a
sense of mystery to the forest. It was because of them that Ayla Forest
was called the ‘Ice Forest’.

As I made my way through the forest, a vast plain reminiscent of an icy
tundra spread out before me. A sky-blue grass field faintly emitting ice
mana. A subtle chill started enveloping my skin.

In the middle of the plain, there was an inconspicuous magic circle.
Even though the grass made it unnoticeable, it was clearly a magic
circle.

“I’ve finally arrived.”

This was the location of the trial. Beyond this magic circle, Frost
Dragon Hilde and the Frostscythe left by the Archwizard Ice Sovereign
must be sealed.

I remembered the setting where the Primordial Elemental Kings caused
mana to be undetectable from the outside. That was why, until now, no
one had discovered that the 8-star familiar and the ultimate weapon were
hidden here.

Even if an archwizard-level person were to come, the situation would be
the same.

I took out the four pieces of the ‘Traces of the Ice Sovereign’ magic
stones and dropped them onto the magic circle.

Then, I began wearing all kinds of cold-weather clothing from my magic
pouch.

Everything was covered except for my eyes. Due to the numerous layers of
clothes, my figure had become so thick that it made extreme obesity seem
insignificant.

‘Walking is uncomfortable.’

Still, as long as I could walk, it was enough.

I took a deep breath.

Bending one knee was difficult, so I just laid down and placed my thick,
gloved hand on the magic circle.

Even if I looked ridiculous, considering the fact that I was about to
undergo a trial to obtain the ultimate ice elemental weapon, there was
nothing I could do about it.

And finally, the last step.

“I will face the Trial of Frost.”

My vision was instantly filled with a bluish hue. A powerful light that
started emanating from the magic circle enveloped me.

Suddenly feeling a floating sensation, I closed my eyes.

**T/N:** Changed Demonic Beast -&gt; Magic Beast. This is to
differentiate between magic beasts and demonic creatures, whereas
demonic creatures are closer to demons, but magic beasts are not.

<span id="0051_52_-_Prologue_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 52: - Prologue (2)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (2) ༻**

When I opened my eyes, I found myself lying on a shimmering surface.
Beneath me was a magic circle emitting a calm, pale blue light.

In front of me was a panoramic view of an icy cavern. It was the trial
chamber.

A place where you could enter at will, but not leave.

The Frost Dragon’s permission was required to get out of the chamber. It
was the only one authorized to enter and exit this space.

‘As expected, it’s magnificent…’

Seeing it in reality was completely different from seeing it in the
game. The vast cavern had a breathtaking landscape, one that could
easily be mistaken for a palace of ice.

My eyes darted around, and I gulped as I caught sight of a huge
passageway.

Beyond it, a beautifully shaped iceberg laid in wait.

Trapped inside was a white dragon, frozen in time.

I stood up and staggered towards the white dragon, finding it difficult
to walk while bundled up in my winter clothes.

Once through the passage, the sheer size of the iceberg overwhelmed me.

The ice surrounding the cave was illuminated by pale blue ice mana,
causing the white dragon’s jade scales to glow even more brilliantly.

Pale blue mana faintly emanated from within the iceberg. The mana seemed
to circulate through the ice, allowing it to maintain itself regardless
of the white dragon’s will.

The dragon was a symbol and legend of northern Zelver.

It was an eight-star magic beast, the Frost Dragon Hilde that was once
the familiar of the Ice Sovereign.

\[Frost Dragon Hilde\] **Lv:** 180

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[It is happy to see you.\]

Inside the mass of ice, the two eyes of the Frost Dragon opened –
awakening after a thousand years of slumber.

The sparkling pupils that resembled emeralds were directed at me,
vertically slit like those of a reptile.

\[O human, have you come to face the Trial of Frost?\]

The Frost Dragon’s archaic voice echoed in my head, sounding like an
adult woman.

Indeed… The sight of the Frost Dragon in reality was awe-inspiring,
comparable in size to a small mountain. With a single step, it could
effortlessly crush someone like me, ending my life as easily as a bug.

I became tense. Letting out a lungful of air, I nodded.

“Yes.”

\[You have proven yourself worthy by coming here. I will open the door
to your trials\].

*Whaaaah────!!*

The giant ice gate behind the Frost Dragon opened its jaws, releasing an
intense pale blue light. At the end of the pathway formed by the light,
a distant darkness took its place.

From within the passage, a cold wind started blowing. Despite my tightly
bundled winter clothing and my elemental bracelet tuned to ice
resistance, the cold pricked my skin.

From now on, I had to pass through this windswept passage.

\[Cruel visions will test your spirit, while harsh cold will consume
your flesh. Prove that you are qualified to overcome these trials and
become the wielder of the Frostscythe\].

***Ah, it’s been a while since I’ve heard such epic lines.***

Putting aside the anxiety, it brought back memories of the time I
obtained the ultimate weapon during the second semester of the second
year as a magical knight in Märchen Academy. It made my heart swell.

Anyways, the game of life and death had begun. If I could overcome the
trials before freezing to death, the Frostscythe would be mine.

***The trials are vicious.***

Plausible events were woven into an ordeal to eat away at the spirit of
the challenger.

In the game, Ian encountered a time from his past when he endured
torment and disdain. He did, however, have unwavering fortitude. Such
trials could be easily overcome, all you needed to do was witness the
story and defeat a few enemies.

***I don’t know what trials await me. Will I be lost in this body,
entangled in Isaac’s past?***

‘No matter the trials, there’s no difference from the things I’ve faced
so far.’

***I just have to overcome them.***

Especially when it came to mental strength, I was confident. Even when
trapped in this feeble body, my mental fortitude remained far superior
to my other stats.

***In any case, today will be the day that Isaac Coin traces a steep
upward curve.***

I moved past the Frost Dragon and entered the pale blue passageway.

Unexpectedly, the light faded quickly, revealing a dusky landscape. It
was a dark night, and the only thing I could see was a raging blizzard
reminiscent of a rainstorm.

A passageway of unknown width stretched out ahead of me. At its end, a
faint beam of light directed me like a lighthouse beacon. The
Frostscythe must be over there.

“It’s cold…!”

「Ice Shield (Ice Element, ★2)」

I started running at a full sprint, wrapping my cloak around me to block
the frigid wind. The cold was unbearable.

Even my eyeballs seemed to freeze. I closed my eyes for three seconds as
I ran, very briefly opened them to make sure that I was on track, closed
them again for three seconds, and so on.

The closer I got to the beam of light, the more violent the blizzard
became. The bitter cold was digging into my skin through my winter coat
and chilling me to the bone.

Then,

**─────Face the Trial of Frost.**

The voice of the woman called the Ice Sovereign echoed in my head and I
lost my consciousness.

\* \* \*

Frost Dragon Hilde was lost in thought as she sifted through her
memories.

The red-eyed man who had just entered the trial, bundled up tightly to
protect against the cold, was a sight to behold.

Facing the Frost Dragon herself, he showed no surprise or fear. It was
as if he knew that she would be here.

Furthermore, despite appearing weak on the surface, an intense aura
emanated from him, reminiscent of the long-lost emerald light that the
Frost Dragon had yearned for.

The Ice Sovereign. The aura of the ancient archwizard who had once
commanded the Frost Dragon as a familiar was flowing from the
weak-looking man.

To be precise, it was Isaac’s nine-star passive skill \[Ice Sovereign\],
but the Frost Dragon was unaware of that fact.

\[A thousand years, how futile\].

The image of a cold-hearted archwizard who had always lived in solitude
about a thousand years ago flashed before her eyes. For the
highest-ranked magic beast, the Frost Dragon, a thousand years was
nothing.

For all those years, she had been drifting in her dreams. In them, she
could conquer the world alongside the Ice Sovereign.

And now, after a thousand years, the soul of the longed-for archwizard
had begun its next incarnation.

There was nothing strange about it. It was simply fate.

\[Have you finally been reborn, Ice Sovereign?\].

He was undoubtedly the reincarnation of the Ice Sovereign.

For a thousand years, the Frost Dragon had kept the Frostscythe’s mana
from invading Märchen Academy.

But now, a new wielder of the Frostscythe had appeared.

And he was the reincarnation of the Ice Sovereign.

It seemed that the time had come to stop living confined within her
dreams.

● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●

“We shall now proceed with the summer vacation ceremony for the first
year students of the Magic Department.”

The end-of-semester re-evaluation consisted of several elemental magic
tests. It was very modest compared to the traditional end-of-semester
evaluation’s scale, but it was also the most intuitive.

Thus, the first semester came to a close. The scores from all previous
evaluations would be combined to determine the overall score for the
semester.

I came in 230th place out of 300. That was to be expected. Anything
other than last place.

The road ahead was long, but I was still aiming for the top seat. Grades
served as an important indicator of how much I had improved.

Under the blue sky, a large cluster of fluffy clouds was drifting
lazily…

…?

“…What?”

An intense disorientation washed over me. I snapped out of it, realizing
I was experiencing a repeat of a time period I had already been through.

I glanced around quickly. Rows and rows of first-year magic students sat
in chairs arranged in an orderly fashion in the central plaza of Märchen
Academy.

The summer vacation ceremony was in full swing. If it was the vacation
ceremony, it would have been only a few days ago….

“Is this… the trial?”

I assumed the trial would reveal something I didn’t know about Isaac’s
troubled past. I might’ve been able to use this opportunity to learn
more about his background.

But this was… very different from what I had expected.

Nothing happened during the summer vacation ceremony. It was carried out
peacefully and ended peacefully as well. If there was anything special
about that day, it was Kaya’s unexpectedly bold behavior.

In fact, it was so peaceful that it became unnerving.

As the ceremony progressed, Luce began reading the proclamation from the
podium. I opened her status window.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 150

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[ekd\]\_\$&())&\^&(\#\$ㅁ앹\#\$@%%ㅐ야god()(&&&!@\]

The mental state was in disarray.

The \[Psychological Insight\] skill could not be wrong; it was a
testament to the fact that this world was flawed.

Sure enough, Luce was still giving me a gentle smile. But now was not
the time to admire her lovely smile.

I started pondering, trying to wrap my head around this confusing
situation.

***What is happening today…?***

‘For now… I should try acting like I did back then.’

I decided to jog my memory and repeat my exact actions from that day.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the trials had pushed Ian to the brink,
seemingly intent on breaking his spirit. This one would be no exception.
It would be a desperate attempt to eat away at my sanity.

After the summer vacation ceremony ended, I slowly started walking
towards a corner of the Butterfly Garden.

“Sir Isaac!”

“Kaya?”

“I-I-I came to say thank you!”

As expected, Kaya came flying over. We exchanged the same conversation
we had before.

*Chuu.*

Kaya kissed my cheek.

“I-I-I’ve committed a grave sin────!!!”

She took off at full speed.

I looked up at the clock tower that stood somewhere in the academy. It
had been 30 minutes since the end of the ceremony.

“Then, what did I do next?”

I didn’t have to wrack my brain or struggle to remember anything.
Obviously, I went to train.

I was working out alone in a corner of the Butterfly Garden.

When the sky darkened, and rain began falling, I returned to my dorm.

After organizing my future plans, I went out to look for the ‘Traces of
the Ice Sovereign’.

Later that night, I fell asleep in my dorm reading a study of beginner
elements textbook.

It was just an ordinary daily routine.

Just an… insignificant daily routine.

‘What the hell…?’

Just as I was going through the memories of the day of the summer
vacation ceremony, suddenly…

*Kwaaaaah────!!!!!!!*

“……!”

A deafening roar echoed through the air.

Startled, I quickly turned to face the source of the sound.

A red glow broke through the clouds in the sky, enveloped by an eerie
blood-red aurora.

A palace-like building with more than a dozen spires. The center of the
academic administration and where the Evil God Nephid’s resurrection
magic circle was engraved. From the centerpiece of the Märchen Academy,
Bartos Hall, a pillar of red light rose endlessly into space.

The scene from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ depicting the resurrection of
the Evil God Nephid flashed through my mind.

\[A powerful demon has been detected!!\] \[There is a significant level
difference with the enemy!!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\] \[※ Escape
immediately!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\] \[※
Escape immediately!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\] \[※ Escape
immediately!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\]

Beyond the system windows that popped up one after the other like
warning signs, a status window appeared in front of me, targeting the
red pillar of light.

\[Nephid, Evil God of Destruction\] **Lv:** ■■■

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire, Void

**Danger:** M■x■m■m

**Psychology:** \[■■■■■■■■■■■■\]

Five pairs of enormous black wings spread out on both sides of the
pillar of light, overshadowing the world. Floating in the air as if
weightless, the owner of the wings, a woman in a black dress, emerged
serenely.

The hem of her dress was long enough to cover the entirety of the Bartos
Hall. The woman with unusually long legs, perhaps even tens of meters
long, stood on the rooftop of the administrative building with her back
to the pillar of light.

My skin crawled, and every hair on my body stood on end. Even if I were
to activate the \[Hunter\] trait, an incomparable amount of mana was
flowing like a flood around Bartos Hall.

“Don’t fuck with me…”

***Even trials have their limits. There are degrees to be overcome.***

From the pillar of red light, a giant dragon composed of black flames
emerged, soaring across the sky above the academy. Its three heads
roared with a grotesque howl.

\[Apocalypse Dragon Azhi Dahāka\] **Lv:** 200

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** Maximum

**Psychology:** \[■\]

Then, an army of demonic creatures composed of black flames burst forth
with eerie laughter.

\[Black Flame\] **Lv:** 190

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** Maximum

**Psychology:** \[■\]

Beyond the red aurora, a pair of eyes so large they could cover the
entire sky gazed upon the world.

\[Angra Mainyu\] **Lv:** 200

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** Maximum

**Psychology:** \[■\]

With each flap of its wings, the Apocalypse Dragon Azhi Dahāka sent down
a storm of black flames. The flames transcended the limits of fire and
began to burn buildings and everything on the ground without
discrimination.

No, it wasn’t burning. It was annihilating.

Suddenly, disparate black spheres formed out of thin air. Everything
that came into contact with them vanished into nothingness, as if it had
never existed in the first place.

This was a secluded island located in the eastern part of the continent.
The only escape route was the bridge connecting it to the mainland, but
even if we were to flee now, we wouldn’t be able to run away from those
who had come to end this world.

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu──────!!!!!!*

*Hwaaaaaaaaaaar──────!!!!!!*

The Evil God Nephid stretched her arm upwards, and a flaming black
sphere formed above her, growing in size until it filled the sky.

The sphere was engraved with anomalous black streaks in all directions.
There was a rift in space. That astronomical amount of mana had
distorted even the fabric of space itself.

I… could do nothing. Nothing except for witnessing the end of this world
with my own eyes.

And then, with a flick of her arm, she lowered it.

Slowly, the flaming black sphere descended upon the world.

「■■ (Darkness Element, ★9)」

*The world was mercilessly engulfed by the black flames.*

*However, the agony of my entire body burning did not last long.*

***The End.***

*The world perished.*

*And I vanished.*

● ● ● ● ● ● ●

“We shall now proceed with the summer vacation ceremony for the first
year students of the Magic Department.”

“…”

I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, I found myself back at
the start of the vacation ceremony.

Cold sweat trickled down my spine.

My ears felt clogged.

I couldn’t hear the ceremony host’s voice or the students’ muffled
chatter.

“For real… Are you serious?”

I sighed deeply, burying my face in my hands. The students beside me
gave me side glances, but I wasn’t in the right state of mind to pay
attention to them.

I took several deep breaths. Despite the instinctive fear conveyed by
the Evil God washing over me in waves, I was able to quickly gather my
emotions thanks to the \[Frozen Soul\] effect of \[Ice Sovereign\].

Afterward, I thought quietly.

“…Let’s give it a try.”

I wouldn’t get discouraged just because I’d witnessed the Evil God’s
appearance.

When I thought about it calmly, it wasn’t much different from what I had
experienced before.

I just had to overcome any adversity that came my way.

<span id="0052_53_-_Prologue_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 53: - Prologue (3)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (3) ༻**

“*Hehehe*, it’s about time, commoner.”

A wicked laughter, in its own way.

Keridna loved theater and was deeply in love with the role of the
‘Villainous Daughter’, so much so that she would often clumsily pretend
to be a villain, designating herself as the villainous daughter.

Her current laughter was a result of that.

At the manor of the Northern Duchy of Whiteclark, the white sky, where
snow was slowly sprinkling down, was gradually being consumed by
darkness.

Keridna Whiteclark, a woman with short pink hair, sat alone at a desk in
her room.

She had seen Isaac’s vision through the surveillance spell \[Sight
Synchronization\], but the intense psychological strain caused her to
struggle with her emotions for several days.

Now, she had steeled her heart. The time had come to spy on Isaac once
again, as she had originally intended.

“*Hehe*… The time has come to reveal your true colors, petty commoner.”

Since earlier, Keridna had giggled and broken out into a cold sweat,
while spouting one awkward line after another as if she were in a
theatrical play.

She was as nervous as she was a few days ago, which caused her to
hesitate.

But for the sake of the future, she figured it had to be done.

Finally, Keridna tightly closed her eyes and activated \[Sight
Synchronization\]. A crackling electricity flashed through her mind, and
Isaac’s field of vision at the Märchen Academy grounds began to unfold
before her.

“Huh…?”

Something was… strange.

All she could see was pitch-black darkness and a raging blizzard
surrounding him. It went completely dark for three seconds, then the
scenery briefly flickered before darkening again. Isaac seemed to be
enduring the bitter cold to the point where it was difficult to even
open his eyes.

The Duchy of Whiteclark might as well be winter year-round, but
everywhere else, including Märchen Academy, was supposed to be in the
midst of summer.

***Has he come to the northern region? No, that can’t be…***

The environment itself was unnatural. It wasn’t even time for it to be
pitch-black, and there was a raging blizzard.

Yet Isaac seemed to be confidently moving forward in that mysterious and
dangerous place.

“Arghh…!”

Suddenly, Isaac crashed into the ground, and Keridna jumped to her feet
in alarm.

Isaac’s eyes were closed, and he seemed to have lost consciousness,
which caused his vision to completely black out.

Keridna ruffled her hair with her eyes still closed.

“Ugh, is something wrong…?” Keridna’s voice trembled, “Wake up… What are
you doing, not waking up…!”

Keridna felt an urgent sense of panic. Since \[Sight Synchronization\]
could only observe physical sight, she had no way of knowing that Isaac
had entered a trial.

The only thing she could see was a person dying before her very eyes.

She couldn’t just stand there and do nothing. Keridna’s eyes snapped
open. She sprinted out of her room as soon as \[Sight Synchronization\]
automatically released.

Her parents had gone to visit another noble family, so her only option
was to seek help from her older sister, Aichel Whiteclark, the acting
head of the household.

“Aichel!! Older sis!!”

Aichel was wise. So if anyone could find a solution to rescue Isaac, who
was in a life-threatening situation in an unknown location, it would be
her.

With that thought in mind, Keridna called out Aichel’s name as she
rushed through the mansion’s corridors.

\* \* \*

The trial to obtain an ultimate weapon in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

By overcoming said trials, one could obtain the ultimate weapon
pertaining to a specific element.

Even discovering the exact meaning of “overcoming the trial” was part of
the trials’ content. However, my game knowledge already held the answer.

Simply put, one must fearlessly face and overcome danger while
surviving.

For our protagonist, Ian Fairytale, the trial was to face a despicable
nobleman who had tormented him. In the past, Ian had been beaten to a
pulp by him and his men.

Ian faced death several times during the trial due to the despicable
nobleman’s actions crossing the line. Should that just be called the
setting for a trial? It was a cancerous development, but they did
provide a refreshing resolution in the end.

It also explored Ian’s backstory and background, his trauma, and why he
aspired to become a Magic Knight, etc…

As of now, it seemed like a good story.

In the end, Ian overcame his past trauma, defeated the despicable
nobleman, and cleared the trial.

‘For me, what I have to overcome is the Evil God.’

Although the scale of the trial didn’t quite match up, lamenting about
it would be utterly useless. It was already said and done, but the
context should be the same.

In my case, *‘Prevent the World from Ending’* should be the condition
for clearing the trial.

*Smack-!*

I roughly slapped my cheeks with the palms of my hands to gather my
determination.

The host of the vacation ceremony and the students all stared at me.

***What are you looking at, brats?***

The vacation ceremony would last a total of 20 minutes. Then, after 30
minutes, Nephid would be resurrected, which meant that each round was a
maximum of 50 minutes.

Time flowed much faster here compared to the real world. I had already
experienced this in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I didn’t know the exact difference it would make, but it was easy to
tell when I was dying since my character’s body would be marked.

‘How do I stop the world from ending in the first place?’

It was a fundamental question.

No matter what, it was impossible to catch up to the final boss’s level,
and the trick that I used in \[Fictional Hell\] to get stronger wouldn’t
work here.

‘I don’t have enough information… First, I need to figure out what’s
going on.’

With that in mind, I stood up from my seat and started running. My
destination was Bartos Hall, a huge palace-like administrative building
at the center of Märchen Academy, where Nephid would resurrect. I wanted
to get to the bottom of what was causing the Evil God’s sudden
resurrection.

As soon as I looked up, I realized the answer to my question: a
translucent barrier shaped like a dome or a soap bubble covered a large
area of the rooftop. I gasped in disbelief.

“Is that how it’s set up…”

Unbelievable.

A translucent golden barrier was covering the rooftop. Numerous analog
clock models were carved into the barrier, swirling through the space.
The shapes of the rotating hour, minute, and second hands quickly caught
my eye.

In the center of the rooftop, an obelisk of varying colors stood tall.
The barrier originated from that obelisk.

It was the nine-star time magic, \[Obelisk of Eternity\]

Time accelerated within the area where it was activated. I wonder if
that was what caused the sudden resurrection of the Evil God that was
supposed to appear in the third year.

It was a common story, but even in this world, there were forbidden
domains of magic. Magic that transcended the realm of Truth and God.
Time manipulation was a prime example of this.

And that’s exactly what was happening on the rooftop of Bartos Hall.

“To reach the rooftop, I have to enter the building no matter what.”

It was impossible to penetrate the barrier created by the \[Obelisk of
Eternity\]. Time froze for anything that came into contact with its
surface. No shock or impact could even touch that barrier.

It was a bonus that it was impervious to mana perception, as even the
mana that emanated from it froze in time.

***What about destroying Bartos Hall itself?***

Not possible. Upon closer inspection, it was covered by a light yellow
translucent barrier, similar to the color of the outer walls of Bartos
Hall. It was probably a defensive spell from one of the minions inside
Bartos Hall.

‘If anyone is capable of all this, it’s…’

In the story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, only one person fit that
description… ‘that woman’.

‘This is driving me crazy.’

My mind was spinning. First the Evil God, and now her…

A trial was designed to be overcome if one could figure out how.

To put it another way…

This imaginary world would create loopholes as small as a needle’s eye
for me to overcome my trial. This meant it would do everything it could
to stop me.

I swallowed dryly and pushed open the ornate doors of Bartos Hall and
climbed the stairs to the roof.

As I entered the building, I couldn’t help but furrow my brows at the
expected situation.

An eerie central hall; the walls adorned with beautiful structures,
statues, and intricate patterns were scattered with splatters of crimson
blood.

And rows of soldiers.

Big men in white military uniforms emblazoned with trump card designs
stood orderly along the walls, holding spears in their hands.

Trump Soldiers wearing masks with grotesque, half-smiling designs. It
was the army of minions under the command of the student body president,
Alice Carroll.

\[Trump Soldier ♠\] **Lv:** 130

**Elements:** Water

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[You\*\](&%& Lord()!)!so(\*\] \[Trump Soldier ♥\]

The Trump Soldiers had seized control of Bartos Hall.

\[Hello?\]

An eerie voice, neither male nor female, echoed through the air. It came
from my feet.

How could I not recognize this voice?

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, during the 「Alice Subjugation」 battle,
it was one of the powerful bosses that blocked the player’s way.

Even though I had already anticipated it, goosebumps erupted from all
over my body.

I tilted my head down and saw a purple cat with a black bowler hat on
its head. Its fleshy body made it appear sluggish, but it had an
expression brimming with nonchalance.

It grinned at me from ear to ear.

\[Phantom Cat Cheshire\] **Lv:** 175

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** \^%%!\^&

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:** \[You&\*)(&(\^%\$&\^ Kill)(&(\*\^\#\$\#%\^\]

Alice Carroll’s 8-star familiar, ‘Phantom Cat Cheshire’. The strength of
this small cat rivaled that of Galia.

This world was out to stop me from overcoming my trial.

It seemed like I was facing one of the enemies commanded by Alice that I
feared the most.

\[You look cute. Just to Alice’s liking. She’ll go crazy for you.\]

Cheshire had a temperament like a bouncing ping pong ball that didn’t
know where or how to bounce. One minute they would be having an engaging
conversation, then killing you the next.

Or in the process of trying to kill someone, they might abruptly say,
‘I’m in a good mood because my breathing just improved’ for some absurd
reason and spare your life.

An utterly uncontrollable personality.

However, precisely because it had a conceptless and unpredictable
personality, some things became even more effective.

‘Okay, deep breath.’

As a ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ veteran, I knew exactly how to lower
Cheshire’s guard.

After I wiped the sweat from my brow, I placed my hand on my knee and
leaned down to Cheshire.

After that, I opened my mouth.

“Oh, how adorable…! I’ve never seen such a cute cat before!”

\[…Meow?\]

“Whose cat is it? Wow, look at the fine fur. It’s awesome.”

\[Meow?\]

It was said that compliments could even make whales dance.

Cheshire was weak to compliments. Extremely weak. The context didn’t
matter. The cat simply enjoyed being praised, whether it was in the
middle of a war zone or a murder scene.

“Who is your master really? I’m so jealous… I wish I had such a
beautiful and handsome cat.”

***Cheshire is gender-neutral. It loves compliments, both male and
female.***

\[Oh, you have a good eye, rookie. The fact that I’m beautiful and
handsome is as clear as day.\]

Standing tall, Cheshire was full of energy.

Cheshire’s head bounced up and down in delight as I continued to shower
them with praise.

“Well done, well done, well done\~!”

\[Meowww!\]

At one point, Cheshire did a trick where they spun their body around
like a figure skater, and I bent my waist while applauding
enthusiastically.

Amidst the solemnly aligned Trump Soldiers, we felt like we were having
a playful party just between the two of us.

\[How’s this for a showmanship trick, on a scale of one to ten?\]

“One… nine points?”

\[Meowww! You mean a perfect nine out of nine!\]

Cheshire happily laughed and squirmed again. It was a nerve-wracking
feeling, but I had to work hard to cater to their mood.

“But what have you, a beautiful, handsome, and talented cat been doing
all this time?”

\[Meowww! It’s because the God of the End is about to resurrect to
destroy the world. I was killing everyone to prevent any
interference\~\]

“Hmm, is that so?”

‘Interference.’ Did that mean disrupting the \[Obelisk of Eternity\]
within Bartos Hall was possible?

‘…It might be worth a try.’

As soon as I pondered over Cheshire’s words, a clue to resolving this
situation quickly formed inside my mind.

In that moment.

「Black Rabbit (Neutral Element, ★7)」

*Swoosh─*

“…Huh?”

An indescribable shock pierced through my entire body. My gaze wandered
against my will. I realized some kind of magic had hit me, and my body
had lost the ability to function.

I couldn’t even feel anything. My legs lost strength, and I collapsed
onto the ground.

Complete numbness. I couldn’t even lift a finger. I couldn’t even take a
breath. It felt like even my sanity was becoming paralyzed.

I was helplessly dying. I realized this fact all too clearly─

*Click clack, click clack─*

In my blurred field of vision, I began to see a wide central staircase
with a red carpet laid upon it. A tall girl dressed in a long-sleeved
uniform that was adorned with a black-and-white checkered headband and
choker descended the stairs. She approached me closely after withdrawing
her ashen magic circle.

“You, the troublemaker.”

Her light pink eyes stared directly at me.

A seductive voice. It was a voice that seemed to solely exist to bewitch
all men.

‘Alice Carroll…’

The darkness of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. That shadowy figure, the
hidden mastermind─student council president, Alice Carroll.

She flashed a mysterious smile.

\[Ali\*()(&\^%Ce Car&\*\] **Lv:** 1&\^\*&%\$

**Race:** &\*@an

**Elements:** \$&\^%!\#)

**Danger:** Extr\*(&\*4\#)

**Psychology:** \[♠♥♣◆\]

Due to Alice’s unique trait \[Red Queen’s Paradox\], her information
couldn’t be viewed. Her ability to cause all information, including
status windows, to completely vanish from observers was no exception.

This was also why Dorothy could not see through Alice’s true nature
using the power of \[All In The World\].

Alice knelt in front of me, lowering herself and raising her chin to
look at me.

*Silence*.

She just watched as I struggled to breathe.

My brain was losing its functionality. I couldn’t delve deeply into
anything.

Before long, my life quietly faded away like an ember that had exhausted
its strength.

● ● ● ● ● ●

“We will now be holding the summer vacation ceremony for the first-years
of the Magic Department.”

“Argh!”

Like holding oxygen in my lungs and then exhaling all at once, I let out
a loud breath. Perhaps as a result of my earlier scream, the host of the
vacation ceremony paused to stare at me, along with the rest of the
students.

“Ugh, ugh… huff.”

I rested my hand on my chest and took a moment to catch my breath. As
soon as my breathing calmed down, I immediately began to organize the
situation in my head.

The host stared at me for a moment and then resumed the vacation
ceremony.

The students also turned away from me. Except for the ones I knew, like
Luce and Kaya. Luce’s worried eyes were especially noticeable.

Of course, I couldn’t be bothered by that.

‘I think I get it.’

Alice used the \[Obelisk of Eternity\] to hasten the resurrection of the
Evil God. Thus, she was resurrected early.

In other words.

‘Defeat Alice and stop the Evil God from resurrecting.’

The methodology was straightforward. The first step was to defeat Alice.

Alice, along with Dorothy formed the greatest powers of Märchen Academy.

By the time the 「Alice Subjugation」 battle took place, Dorothy had
already lost her life. Eventually, Ian and his allies would defeat
Alice’s minions and face her in a climactic battle in Bartos Hall.

But in this timeline, Dorothy was alive. However, there was no way to
quickly gather all of the necessary resources to defeat Alice.

In other words, the only way to get past Alice was to recruit Dorothy.
There was no other option.

But…

‘Where’s Dorothy?’

Only then did I realize something.

I hadn’t seen Dorothy since the day of the vacation ceremony.

<span id="0053_54_-_Prologue_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 54: - Prologue (4)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (4) ༻**

In the world of eternity, there existed an obelisk that governed time.
Every now and then, a bluebird flew to the obelisk and grinded its beak
against it. It chipped away at it until it was nothing more than a grain
of sand.

When the obelisk gradually wore away after near-infinite time and
finally lost its original form, one second of eternity was said to have
passed.

This was a mythical tale from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, and the
time-acceleration spell, \[Obelisk of Eternity\], was a spell derived
from that myth.

The \[Obelisk of Eternity\] was the desire of the mastermind, Alice
Carroll, and if activated on the rooftop of Bartos Hall, it could
shorten the time required for the resurrection of the Evil God.

The only requirement was to use the Phantasmal Clock as a catalyst, so I
remembered the in-game story of Alice sending her minions to find it.

However, the Trial of Frost had apparently given her the Phantasmal
Clock.

As a result, Alice’s activation of the \[Obelisk of Eternity\]
accelerated time long enough to resurrect the Evil God.

The Phantasmal Clock was probably being used as a catalyst on the
rooftop of Bartos Hall.

‘The solution to the trial is pretty simple.’

The solution was simple: turn the hands of the Phantasmal Clock
backward. It was like a stopwatch, but with the push of a button, it
would reverse itself.

Then, at the place where the \[Obelisk of Eternity\] was triggered, time
would reverse its course in proportion to the amount of time
accelerated. I would witness the absurd sight of the Evil God
resurrecting and being thrown back into the abyss. It seemed like 3D
glasses and popcorn would be necessary.

However, there was a side effect: everything within range would also be
reversed and travel back in time. Of course, I didn’t need to worry
about the consequences in this world.

‘So, my plan is…’

To break through Alice’s defense.

Go to the rooftop of Bartos Hall and press the button on the Phantasmal
Clock.

And prevent the destruction of the world.

***This trial will be cleared in no time. It’s quite easy, isn’t it?***

‘The problem is that Dorothy is the only one who can make it happen…’

I was walking around the academy grounds, away from the vacation
ceremony in the square. I needed to find Dorothy.

Perhaps this trial was designed in such a way that it could only be
cleared by enlisting the aid of Dorothy. There was no other way to deal
with Alice.

‘But how come I couldn’t see her on a day like this?’

***Where are you, Dorothy?***

I wondered if she was taking some time off to enjoy the scenery or
sleeping in because it was her vacation.

As I continued to think, a strong sense of unease washed over me.

‘That’s strange.’

The emerging question stopped me in my tracks.

Dorothy was a character who bravely accepted that she was destined to
die. For this reason, she was willing to lay down her life in order to
protect the academy’s students.

‘It’s odd that she hasn’t appeared despite the Evil God being
resurrected.’

It didn’t make sense, even if her opponent was the Evil God. Dorothy was
the type of person to face the Evil God even if it meant losing her
life. She was someone who saw her own life as expendable.

Even the ridiculous explanation of the Evil God appearing while Dorothy
was asleep so she couldn’t stop her made no sense. Dorothy’s mana
perception was beyond compare. She would have awakened to the enormity
of the Evil God’s mana.

‘Is there a reason why Dorothy hasn’t appeared…?

First of all, it was obvious that Dorothy was on the island. There was
no way she could have gone out of the academy grounds.

Then… what really happened?

“Senior Dorothy!!! Where are you?!!!”

I was hoping that Dorothy would answer my call if she was nearby.

But no matter how many times I called out, she never appear. Maybe she
was in her dorm.

I rushed to the academy’s dorm and headed for Charles Hall, the
dormitory for the top-ranked students.

It was very quiet at the dormitories of the Magic Department.

The first years were amid a belated vacation ceremony, and the rest of
the students were already in the middle of vacation.

It couldn’t have been a better time to sneak into Charles Hall.

“Eden!”

\[Kyuu-!\]

Clusters of light brown mana gathered in the air and took the form of
the small golem familiar, Eden. I didn’t know if this guy was real or
fake, but that didn’t matter right now.

I knew where Dorothy’s room was. It was something I learned while
playing ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

“Eden, create a staircase for me!”

\[Kyuu!\]

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」 「Ice Generation (Ice Element,
★1)」

Eden created a crude stone staircase on the exterior of the girl’s wing
of Charles Hall.

I built an ice ladder on top of it. My \[Elemental Efficiency\] was
higher than before, so it was a more sophisticated ladder.

Dorothy’s room was on the third floor. Even the third floor was high up
in Charles Hall due to the high ceilings on all floors.

I had no time to feel guilty about sneaking into her room. I scrambled
up the crude staircase, then climbed up the ice ladder.

A room on the third floor. Through the window, I caught a glimpse of
Dorothy’s room.

It was gray, devoid of anything other than essential furniture and basic
items. It seemed like the kind of space where an incredibly quiet and
uninteresting person would live in.

Dorothy’s room was always like that. The only adorable thing left was a
teddy bear stuck inside the wardrobe, its fluffed-up fur peeking out as
it stuck out its arm.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Dorothy’s true feelings were never fully
revealed.

However, it was clear that she was sorting through things that might
make her hesitate to throw her own life away.

I only discovered this indirectly by exploring the map and searching for
traces of Dorothy.

‘She’s not here…’

Anyway, Dorothy wasn’t in her room. I quickly descended to the ground,
unsummoned Eden, and started running again.

I searched every place she might be, but to no avail.

In the end, the time of apocalypse arrived, and the Evil God Nephid was
resurrected.

Black spheres of flame crashed to the ground.

And just like that, the world met its end.

● ● ● ● ●

“We will now be holding the summer vacation ceremony for the first years
of the Magic Department.”

Finding Dorothy in the vast academy ground was going to be extremely
difficult.

I, on the other hand, had a time limit. Once the frigid cold of the
Frostscythe completely consumed my physical body, I would die.

‘What should I do?’

What I needed now was manpower. I needed as many people as possible to
help me find Dorothy.

However, when I played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, alternative paths that
deviated from predetermined routes to clearing the trial tended to be a
landmine.

This was one of the reasons why Ian felt hopeless during his trial.

‘But this trial is different from what Ian went through.’

Maybe one of the routes to clearing this trial was to get a group of
people together to find Dorothy.

‘I should give it a try.’

Nodding my head, I stood up from my seat. The ceremony host and the
students of the Magic Department started to stare in my direction.

Undaunted, I raised my right arm in the air and shouted.

“Kaya! Mateo! Luce! Amy! Follow me…!”

Moments later, I gulped.

In the blink of an eye, the faces of the students and the host of the
vacation ceremony had vanished.

It was like an egg ghost; their eyes, nose, and mouths were completely
invisible. Only an apricot-colored sea remained.^1^E/N: An egg ghost is
a Korean ghost that lacks limbs and any facial features. It is said that
if a person sees an egg ghost, they will die.

Their gazes were all fixed on me. Without a hint of movement, they
solely focused on me.

“Holy shit…!”

A shiver ran down my spine. It was a bizarre sight, like something
straight out of a horror movie.

And then.

*Kiwooooooooh─!*

The heads of the faculty and students were split in half.

I could see a cross-section of their red bodies with numerous teeth and
elongated tongues, rising like pythons before my very eyes.

I staggered backward. An anaconda-like tongue protruded from each
severed head.

I was already running at full speed when I heard a chair collide with my
leg, sending me tumbling backward.

‘Ah, fuck! I shouldn’t have looked…!’

It was just like what I saw in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

When I met Kaya after the vacation ceremony, her head would have
probably split in half right in front of me if we hadn’t had the same
conversation.

I couldn’t imagine how hopeless I would have been without my gaming
knowledge. Seriously… those landmines were even worse in person.

***Damn, these trials. How ridiculous. Forget it. I’ll just find her on
my own then.***

Like I had said before, the academy grounds were ridiculously vast, so
it was crucial to quickly rack my brain and pinpoint the specific places
where Dorothy could be.

“Where could Dorothy be…! Tell me!!”

I started pulling out every conversation and story I had shared with
Dorothy up until now, trying to remember every little detail.

Senseless chatter, useless jokes, anything would do. I just needed to
find a clue.

***Where can Dorothy possibly be at this moment? Where is that place?***

***Where are you?***

***Where?***

*─ President, what are you doing?*

*─ □□□□□, □□□’□□ □□□□. □□□□’□ □□□ □□□□□□ □□ □□ □□□□□□ □□□ □□□□?*

*─ Your expression seems a bit too relaxed for that.*

*─ □□’□ □□□□□□□ □’□ □□□□□□□ □□ □□□, □□□□□.*

*─ Nihihi, just like how my fan should be!*

● ● ● ●

*─ Do you like me being that?*

*─ □□□. □’□ □ □□□ □□□ □□ □□□□□, □□□□□, □□ □□ □□□□□.*

*─ Hmm, do you like me, President?*

● ● ●

*─ Nihihihi…! Oh, what was that reaction? The president is cute.*

*─ □□□□ □□□ □□□ □□□□□ □□□□ □□□□ □□ □□□□□?*

*─ The stars are so beautiful tonight, I was watching them and suddenly
thought of you, so I came to see you! You’re still training, huh!*

● ●

─ Nihihi, nice to meet you.

─ *□*’*□* *□□□□□* *□□□□* *□□□*’*□□ □□□□□*. *□□□□* *□□* *□□□□* *□□□*
*□□□*.

*─ Look at the way you talk\~ It’s so cute! Nyahaha!*

●

*─ I was falling from the sky!*

*─ □□□□ □□□ □□□□ □□□ □□□□□□□ □□□□ □□□ □□□?*

*─ I was watching the rain clouds gather. I especially like the moment
when the rain clouds form. Should I call it aesthetically pleasing? So!
I was flying around watching it when I said, ‘I’m done now,’ and came
down.*

*─ …*

*─ Nihihi.*

I gazed up at the sky. The rain clouds, which I once thought were fluffy
clouds, were gently floating around. Those clusters of clouds would
surely pour in the afternoon.

From the west, rain clouds drifted and gathered in the direction of the
Arkins Sea.

I explored this area after experiencing multiple deaths. Finally, I
arrived at a cliff that stuck out near the shore.

A schoolgirl with long, lavender hair and a witch’s hat sat on the
cliff, hugging her knees. Her gaze was fixed on the dark clouds that
filled the sky above the distant sea.

“Huff, agh…”

I ran with all my might. Barely catching my breath, I began to approach
Dorothy Heartnova.

She seemed startled by my sudden footsteps, her head slightly trembling.

“Senior.”

“What’s up, President? What brings you here?”

Dorothy turned her head toward me, but her face was still hidden under
the witch’s hat she always wore.

After sniffling once, she lifted her hat to reveal a lovely smile.

She had lived her life admiring the sky, even skipping class for it. She
wanted to take in as much of the world’s beauty as possible in her heart
before her inevitable death.

While hiding her true feelings behind a fake smile, she acted friendly
to everyone, and always strove to shine the brightest.

That was the Dorothy I knew.

“President…?”

I sat down next to Dorothy.

The sight of rain clouds forming… I should have realized the first time
I heard it.

‘What’s so beautiful about that?’

***It’s just cloudy and dark, not beautiful in the slightest.***

***Does Dorothy see herself when she looks into those dark rain
clouds?***

“Senior.”

“Uh, yes?”

The Dorothy here was bound to disappear. She was a mere replica,
observing the sight of rain clouds gathering in the faraway sea during
the vacation ceremony. A simple tool to clear the trial, nothing more,
nothing less.

Still, the more I thought about Dorothy, the more aware I became of how
many things I truly wanted to tell her. I couldn’t bear it if I didn’t
say it now.

It would be difficult to say what I truly wanted to the real Dorothy, so
I decided to take this opportunity to tell her.

I opened my mouth and decided to express the feelings I had been holding
back all this time.

“You know, senior. I thought you were really cool back there.”

“Hmm. Isn’t that why you’re a fan of mine?”

“That’s right, the way you try to shine in any situation, you just
looked so cool. So I thought, ‘Hey, I can’t help but be a fan.'”

“Nihihi, is that so?”

“But, you’re overdoing it, senior.”

“…Huh?”

“You’re forcing yourself to smile, and you’re forcing yourself to see
beauty that isn’t there. It’s because you want to decorate your life
meaningfully and beautifully, even if it’s just a little.”

I said bluntly.

“Honestly, nothing here is actually beautiful, right?”

“…”

Dorothy’s smile slowly faded.

But, as usual, she immediately put on a mask-like smile.

“What are you talking about, President? I’m getting a little bored.”

Dorothy’s smile had a tinge of wariness. One slip of the tongue and she
would cast a spell on me.

In any case, I’ve died a lot in this trial. Rather, if I were to die by
Dorothy’s hand, it would easily be considered the greatest death of my
life. It wouldn’t be so bad if my gravestone said, ‘Cause of Death:
Fanboying Idiot’.

Of course, while I was joking about death, my body was in grave danger.

When I lifted my clothes to check my abdomen, it was frozen solid. There
was only so many times I could regress. Maybe… one or two more times.

Nevertheless.

There was something I wanted to tell Dorothy, even if it meant facing
death.

As I reflected on the time I had spent with her, I began to question
whether my determination to save her was misguided.

***What if Dorothy desires death? What if she doesn’t want me to save
her at all?***

I needed to see Dorothy’s reaction.

“Senior, I will save you.”

I wanted to hear Dorothy’s answer – whether I was allowed to save her or
not.

“So, stop living like you’re on borrowed time, and instead start
thinking about how you want to live after graduation.”

Dorothy’s eyes widened. Her voice trembled.

“Why… would you say that to me?”

***I want you to find happiness.***

***More than anything.***

“Because you’re a shining light to me, senior.”

***It was for that simple reason that I loved Dorothy the most.***

Dorothy flinched. There was an awkward silence, only broken by the sound
of waves crashing.

“…You’re so boring, President.”

Dorothy finally replied, turning her head back to the rain clouds.

There was a hint of laughter in her voice.

“I actually prefer being saved by force. It’s more fun that way\~”

The gathering rain clouds were not pretty in the slightest. There was no
need to pay more attention than necessary.

Dorothy completely understood what I had just said. My sincerity seemed
to have reached her.

I bowed my head, closed my eyes tightly, and felt the humidity of the
sea wash across my skin.

Dorothy wanted to be saved. That was enough.

I opened my eyes again and looked at Dorothy. It was time to get down to
business.

“Senior, there’s something important I need to tell you.”

“You’re getting out of here, right?”

“…?”

***…Huh?***

“I already knew this world was fake. I can see through the essence of
everything, remember?”

“Then, senior, you knew all along…?”

“Not really. I don’t know what will happen next. But I’ve realized that
neither I nor this world are real, so what happens doesn’t matter. I
didn’t feel the need to give any meaning to my existence.”

It was then that I realized.

Dorothy hadn’t fought the Evil God because she knew this world and
herself were fake; there was simply no reason for her to do so.

“But it seems that wasn’t the case.”

Dorothy stood up energetically, then laughed mischievously as she
extended her pure white hand towards me.

“Nihihi. Let me help you, President! Let’s tear down this world
together.”

***I swear. Her smile is as bright and refreshing as a ripened fruit.
It’s so cute. I can’t help but laugh.***

“Yes.”

I took Dorothy’s hand and stood up.

***It’s time to break through this trial.***

Chapter 55: - Prologue (5)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (5) ༻**

“Ahhhhhhh!!!”

***Help!!!***

“Nyahahaha!!! The president is so funny!!”

Dorothy burst into laughter, unconcerned that I might be left behind.

Covered in starlight mana, we were weightlessly flying through the air
towards Bartos Hall at high speeds.

With all my might, I desperately held onto my consciousness that felt
like it would fade at any moment, and screamed at the top of my lungs.

As we flew like that, it took us 3 minutes to reach Bartos Hall from
that distant cliff.

*Bang—!*

Without hesitation, Dorothy kicked the door down with her leg covered in
starlight mana.

I could finally feel the bliss of walking on the ground after basically
being in a state of weightlessness.

“Blech…”

I had to lie down on the floor and vomit.

Meanwhile, the sight of Dorothy grabbing her stomach as she burst into
laughter was quite irritating.

Probably because we entered with the use of magic, the Trump Soldiers
all began to assume battle stances.

Their spears came out and pointed at Dorothy in unison.

“Who are you pointing your spears at?”

Dorothy said with a smug expression as she lightly flicked her hand
wrapped in starlight mana.

「Mini Supernova (Starlight Element, ★4)」

*Boom–! Boom–! Boom–! Boom–! Boom–! Boom–! Boom–! Boom–!*

An incredible sight unfolded before my eyes as the level 130 Trump
Soldiers exploded instantly.

The explosion of starlight was very colorful and diverse. It felt like I
was watching a fireworks display.

“Senior, nice!”

“Nihihi!”

When I gave her a thumbs-up, Dorothy returned it with a wide grin.

“It’s time to get to work, president!”

“Yes! I’m counting on you, senior!”

“Okay, leave it to this big sis!”

Dorothy confidently answered while putting her hand on her chest.

It was so adorable. I couldn’t help but giggle despite the urgent
situation.

I started to run up the large red-carpeted central staircase. While
running, I recalled the time from when I checked the clock tower. I had
five minutes before the Evil God was resurrected.

It would take four to five minutes to reach the roof from here. Time was
running out.

「Black Rabbit (Neutral Element, ★7)」 「Dwarf Star (Starlight Element,
★5)」

*Kuwaaa*────*!!*

*Chararara────!!*

“Ugh!”

As I reached the top of the staircase.

A black rabbit flew towards me, radiating a dark aura, but a brilliant
explosion of mana repelled the rabbit.

The shockwave created by it lightly pushed me, which caused me to fly
sideways and roll down the stairs.

“So, you were the one causing the interference?”

Alice Carroll, the elegant student council president with a dignified
appearance and flowing golden hair, walked towards me with a bored
expression as she uttered that line.

An ashen magic circle was manifesting around her.

“Dorothy Heartnova, I didn’t expect you to be involved.”

Alice’s rose-pink eyes turned towards Dorothy.

Dorothy, with a smile on her face, expanded her starlight magic circle
as she stood guard against Alice.

“Nihihi. As expected, you are trash, Alice.”

“Are you disappointed?”

“No, I’m actually glad. I hate you, but now I see nothing morally wrong
with beating you up, right?”

The two most powerful individuals in Märchen Academy exchanged smiles
and murderous glares simultaneously.

The immense amount of mana seemed to compress the space around them. My
legs trembled as my survival instincts kicked in. However, my passive
skill \[Ice Sovereign\] allowed me to calm down immediately.

*Throw–!*

As I stood up and immediately started running, I pulled out the Sheath
of Disaster and threw it towards Alice.

I felt the sensation of my body being connected by a small thread to the
Sheath of Disaster. I tugged at the thread in my head and cast the
spell.

The magic circle engraved on the Sheath of Disaster glowed in a pale
blue hue. The stored spell, \[Frost Explosion\], had activated.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaa────!*

Cold mana erupted from the Sheath of Disaster, causing ice chunks to
surge.

The gray monster Alice had summoned opened its gaping, toothy mouth. It
swallowed the explosion of mana and ice chunks created by \[Frost
Explosion\] as if it was devouring it.

「Voracious Deity (Neutral Element, ★7)」

A thick, tentacle-like gray monster with rows of eyes lining its body
came out of the ashen magic circle from the ground and stood beside
Alice.

Of course, I knew this would happen. My spell wouldn’t be able to
scratch Alice.

However, I was already running up the stairs and past Alice. The
Voracious Deity followed right behind me, slithering like a snake.

***Nanana, you can’t catch me.***

「Stellar Radiation (Starlight Element, ★5)」

*Chaaaaaaa*───!!

Colorful rays of starry light sliced through the air, penetrating the
body of the Voracious Deity before dissipating.

Alice dodged Dorothy’s magic by rolling to the side. However, it seemed
she was unable to prevent some of the skin on her cheek from being
ripped off.

Dorothy’s starlight magic dealt with physical force in a complicated
way. This led to pure destructive power.

Alice must have noticed the futility of using defensive magic against
Dorothy’s spells. Evasion was the wiser choice.

“Y-You little…”

Alice flashed a murderous smile as she touched the wound on her cheek. A
cross-shaped blood vein sprouted from her forehead, revealing her anger.

***Alright, it’s fine. Alice just needs to be stopped by Dorothy.***

Before I knew it, Phantom Cat Cheshire appeared at Alice’s side with a
serious expression. With Dorothy Heartnova standing in front of it,
there didn’t seem to be room to spare any attention to me.

Dorothy would be no match against Alice with her eight-star familiar,
Phantom Cat Cheshire.

*Chaeeeee────!!*

*Kwagagagaga───!!!*

*Kuuuuuuuuuuu────!!*

Thus, an epic fight between Alice and Dorothy took place.

Dorothy thought the fighting stage was too narrow, so she lured Alice
out by breaking the building’s exterior.

The building and the ground shook. Dust repeatedly rained down from the
ceiling.

My body felt sluggish, probably due to the cold air of the Frostscythe
having taken its toll on me. However, that didn’t slow me down. I
gritted my teeth and ran.

Suddenly, beyond the crumbling exterior walls, I could see Dorothy and
Alice fighting in the sky.

It was very glamorous. Countless star clusters and colorful magic
circles dominated the area. Rays of light poured down, followed by
brilliant explosions of colorful starlight.

No one in Märchen Academy could match Dorothy—a genius blessed by the
heavens and believed to be on her way to becoming an Archwizard.

*Kwaaaaaa─────!!*

*Chararara─────!!*

*Kwagagaga───!!&lt;/i&gt;*

White rabbits, black rabbits, and Trump Soldiers on white pegasi were
summoned in legion-like numbers. Each and every one of them was
overwhelmingly stronger than me.

However, with a single gesture, Dorothy eliminated Alice’s troops with
her starlight mana.

Brilliant starlight and ashen-gray filled the sky. Countless magic
circles manifested and expanded one after the other.

The fight between Dorothy and Alice was escalating.

Finally, I reached the top.

“Haa, haa…”

Catching my breath, I examined the magnificent rooftop view. The
luxurious design was befitting of the exterior of Bartos Hall. Beautiful
structures extending from the outskirts brilliantly illuminated the mana
stone I had with me.

And a giant magic circle filled the rooftop.

A bizarre form engraved with many curved lines. The magic circle emitted
a vivid vermilion light. It was a sign of the resurrection of the Evil
God, Nephid.

At the center of the magic circle stood a yellow rectangular obelisk
that emitted a strange light yellow glow. It was the \[Obelisk of
Eternity\]. A veil that accelerated time encompassed the rooftop.

Suddenly feeling like my body was floating, I looked down at my right
hand.

Slowly, a crackling noise emerged. It seemed to be a phenomenon that
occurred when one entered the realm of the \[Obelisk of Eternity\].

***However, my time will accelerate for a moment before ceasing, because
the Evil God will soon resurrect.***

“Whew.”

I caught my breath and wiped away the sweat from my forehead. It was
time to win.

I ran towards the \[Obelisk of Eternity\]. As expected, a golden glowing
pocket watch was magically floating in front of the obelisk.

‘Phantasmal Clock’. The catalyst for time magic.

Now, if I could just get a hold of it…!

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa────────*!!!

“Argh!!”

As the magic circle intensely glowed, the \[Obelisk of Eternity\]
unleashed.

An enormous pillar of mana rose endlessly into the sky, scattering an
eerie red glow.

As a result, my body was sent flying and crashed into some railing.

The pain in the back of my head was intense. I thought I might faint at
any moment…

“Ahhhhh… ugh.”

However, with a groan, laughter involuntarily escaped from my lips.

I had the Phantasmal Clock in my hand.

“It’s over…!”

It wasn’t too late. I made it!

A red aurora soon filled the sky where Dorothy and Alice were fighting.
Dorothy was surprised.

Above them, a huge eye, big enough to cover the sky, looked down on the
world. Angra Mainyu. A servant of the Evil God.

Next, Apocalypse Dragon Azhi Dahāka emerged from the red pillar and flew
towards the sky while roaring a grotesque cry.

Black mealworms were devouring the magnificent structures that adorned
the rooftop of Bartos Hall. These colossal worms took the place of the
structure they ate.

I grabbed the railing and pulled myself from where I was sitting.

“…!”

Heavy mana silenced the atmosphere with a pressure that threatened to
crush my body. Only then did I realize that the abyssal darkness had
filled the entire rooftop.

In the darkness beneath my feet, numerous slumbering eyes rose up. They
were eerie eyes composed of red irises and black pupils.

As I turned my gaze towards the center of the rooftop, I saw a faint
silhouette of a woman from the red pillar.

The darkness that filled the rooftop was the hem of her black dress, for
her attire was darkness itself.

\[A powerful demon has been detected!!\] \[There is a significant level
difference with the enemy!!\] \[※ Escape immediately!\] \[※ Escape
immediately!\] \[※ Escape imme…\] \[Nephid, Evil God of Destruction\]
**Lv:** ■■■

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire, Void

**Danger:** M■x■m■m

**Psychology:** \[■■■■■■■■■■■■\]

“Nephid…”

Once I cleared the warning windows and saw the Evil God up close, my
survival instinct began to kick into high gear. If it wasn’t for the
effect of \[Ice Sovereign\], my legs would have given out and I would
have collapsed to the ground.

***I can’t even imagine how strong I need to become to defeat her. I’m
not even sure if I can beat her in the first place.***

***However, I will beat that final boss at all costs. I’ll never give
up, even in death.***

So I was going to make up my mind right here, right now.

I took a deep breath and loudly called out a woman’s name.

***“Dorothy!!!”***

I looked at the owner of the name. Her gaze also turned towards mine.

Before long, she had already thrown away her witch hat, her purple hair
fluttering in the wind.

There was a serious expression on her face.

Against the backdrop of the apocalyptic landscape, towards the shining
star witch embraced by colorful starlight.

I screamed at the top of my lungs.

***“You asked me why I trained so hard!!! The world is going to be
destroyed by the Evil God!!! It was to stop that!!!”***

***I possessed the weakest character in my favorite game’s Hell Mode.***

***“I will prevent the destruction of the world!!!”***

***I want to survive, but the way the main character is being controlled
is atrocious.***

***“I’m going to save the world!!! Whether it’s you, me, or anyone else,
I will save them all!!!”***

***There’s no other option.***

***“That’s why I’m here!!!”***

***But me.***

***“Evil God!!!”***

***I have to stop the bad ending myself.***

***“I will take you down…!!”***

Dorothy’s stiff face broke into a smile.

She stretched her arm out towards me, spread her index and middle finger
to form a V, and smiled innocently. A sign of understanding.

I couldn’t help but hear her signature ‘Nihihi’ laugh.

Black flames rained down upon the battlefield, and in the red pillar,
Nephid slowly ascended into the sky.

The hem of the Evil God’s dark dress rose from the ground and swallowed
me whole.

Five pairs of black wings unfurled, causing a fierce storm to erupt.

In the red pillar, a dark shadow gazed down at me.

The Evil God.

I pressed the reverse button of the Phantasmal Clock while taking in her
imposing figure with my eyes.

*────────Click.*

Just for a moment, time stopped─

*Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock━━━━━━━━━*

Accompanied by the rhythmic sound of clock gears turning, a golden light
bathed the surroundings.

Like a video playing in reverse, the Evil God and her servant were
sucked back into the magic circle. The darkness-made clothing of Nephid
that was consuming me started receding like a rising tide.

I suddenly felt a sense of weightlessness come over me. Everything
within the range of the \[Obelisk of Eternity\], including a speck of
dust, had undergone a time reversal corresponding to the accelerated
amount of time.

Under normal circumstances, I would have suffered the side effects as
well… But, since the sudden resurrection of the Evil God was prevented,
I had cleared the trial. Now, all I had to do was return to the cave of
the trial.

I felt my senses being twisted. I couldn’t think of anything anymore.
Slowly, my consciousness drifted away into the distance beyond.

● ● ● ● ● ●

And when I opened my eyes.

I was still in the middle of the trial.

**TL NOTE:**

**We are changing some terms**

**Attribute -&gt; Element**

Chapter 56: - Prologue (6)
==========================

**༺ Prologue (6) ༻**

Once the time reversal ended, I found myself standing in a crude and
narrow room.

The faint scent of wood and an earthy smell flowed through the open
window. It seemed like the rain had stopped a while ago.

As I looked out of the window, I saw a panoramic view of the sky
clearing away the dark clouds over the vast landscape of vegetation. A
rainbow stretched across the sky.

It was a familiar sight and scent.

Even though it was my first time here, I found myself feeling more and
more at home, like a person immersed in nostalgia.

***Where am I?***

I instinctively knew the answer.

*‘It’s home, Isaac’s home.’*

Due to the Phantasmal Clock reversing time in proportion to the time
accelerated, I had traveled over two years into the past.

I was dressed in a plain brown shirt. As I lifted the hem, my frozen
abdomen was clearly visible.

It seemed like I hadn’t cleared the trial yet, considering the fact that
I hadn’t returned to the cavern enveloped in blizzards.

‘Not yet.’

***It’s not over just yet.***

I suspected that this place was where the trial would end. The
acceleration of time, the reversal of it, and Isaac’s past. This series
of events would be the answer to overcoming the trial.

Preventing the resurrection of the Evil God was simply a step to reach
this final rite of passage.

Suddenly, a note on the desk caught my eye. A request from someone was
written on it, reading, ‘Please don’t hate your older sister’.

I didn’t know whose handwriting this was, but it made me feel very
nostalgic.

I opened the door and went out into the hallway. In the narrow hallway,
a young woman with long silver-blue hair stood leaning against the wall.

Red eyes. The same as mine.

“If you’re ready, then go. I can’t bear to see you.”

A hushed voice. I naturally knew who this woman was.

It was Isaac’s sister.

She gently closed her eyes. After uttering those words, she clarified
that she would no longer speak to me.

I didn’t know the full story, but I respected her wishes and began to
cross the hallway on my own.

The wooden plank floor creaked with every step. This house was pretty
old.

*‘I know what I am…’*

A man’s sobbing voice flashed through my mind in a blur. At the same
time, I felt drawn toward the stairs.

I walked out the door and up the wooden stairs, which had signs of being
repaired once or twice.

*‘I’m a worthless piece of shit, I’m…!’*

I grabbed my throbbing head. A familiar voice, although I had never
heard of it before, rang in my head intermittently.

*‘Why would Mom be proud of scum like me?’*

As I reached the second floor, an attic came into view.

*‘I’m an incompetent person, Mom. A useless, useless person… I have zero
talent. I’m like an extra in a play.’*

White silk curtains fluttered in the early autumn breeze.

In front of the curtains, on an old, tattered bed.

A middle-aged woman with silver-blue hair laid still like a corpse,
staring at the ceiling.

A pair of skinny arms rested on the blanket that covered the body.

She was thin. There was no life or vitality in the woman’s body.

*‘I’m sorry, Mom. Sorry… That all I am is scum.’*

“Are you here, Isaac…?”

My heart trembled. It wasn’t my emotion, but Isaac’s. The memory of
intense regret that lingered in this body reacted to that singular word.

The silver-blue haired woman looked at me and mustered up a weak smile.
She gestured for me to come closer. Her hands were thin, with the skin
clinging to her bone.

I slowly approached her. Beside her bed was a walnut wood chair that
someone had prepared for people to sit on at any time.

“I’m sorry to call you here… Why don’t you sit…?”

The woman’s voice cracked like a dry field without moisture.

I traveled back to the time when this woman called me. As I thought
that, I sat down.

It wasn’t hard to guess who the woman in front of me was.
Silver-blue-hair and blood-red eyes. Isaac strongly resembled his
mother.

Outside the window, I could see a moderately-sized maple tree. The
leaves swayed in the wind, looking as if they might fall at any time.

“Will you hold my hand…?”

I held the woman’s skinny hand.

“I called you here because I want to tell you something…”

The woman, as if a single blink was a luxury, gazed at my face and
captured it in her eyes, savoring each fleeting moment.

“It was back when my Isaac was just 8 years old…”

She was reminiscing. Her face looked like she was deeply reflecting on a
precious memory.

“Back then, Mom made a joke. What if Mom became a great knight or
powerful wizard and had to leave you to protect people…”

The woman weakly grinned.

“Because you were a lively kid, you… I thought you would laugh at me for
being so absurd. But then, do you remember what you said…?”

I shook my head.

“…You didn’t say anything. You just… had tears streaming down your
face.”

The woman smiled brightly. Her face filled with happiness.

“At that time, I thought I was a very blessed mother… to have such a
lovely son by my side…”

Tears formed in the corners of the woman’s eyes.

*“Thank you for being born, Isaac. To me, you were my very precious
son…”*

“…”

The voice that echoed in my head when I walked down the creaking hallway
and up the stairs resurfaced in my mind again.

It was Isaac’s voice.

As he heard the woman’s words just now, Isaac could only cry while
belittling himself. He couldn’t bear it any longer, as he told his
departing mother that he wasn’t worthy of being called her proud son.

In his memory, the woman stroked Isaac’s head and shook her head with a
smile.

No matter what Isaac said, to her, he was the son she was proud of and
loved dearly.

Isaac’s regret and trauma stuck to him like mud in the rain. The final
test to finishing this trial was to overcome his heartbreaking regret.

The last thing he said to his departing mother was self-deprecating.

Isaac found this unbearably pathetic.

I didn’t have to think too hard about what I needed to do.

Because the words Isaac had wished he said were listed in my head, I
just needed to recite them.

With a gentle smile on my face, I took her hand in mine.

My lips began to quiver slightly.

“Yeah, you are very blessed, Mom. You gave birth to a perfect son like
me.”^1^T/N: When Isaac says perfect (잘난) here, the word also has a
double meaning, which can mean worthless.

I gave a mischievous smile.

“Have I told you this? I’m trying to enter the Magic Department of the
most prestigious academy in our country. It’s a place only talented
people can enter. I’m going to study and hone my magic there, aiming to
become an Archwizard that even the Empire wouldn’t dare to touch.

“…”

“Because you gave birth to someone like me, Mom is a truly amazing
person.”

I smiled brightly.

“To me, Mom is the most loving and admirable person in the world. Thank
you for giving birth to me, Mom.”

Tears welled up in the corner of her eyes, glistening in her lifeless
pupils.

Finally, she brightly smiled. The transparent tears that had been
welling up smoothly slid down from her eyes to her cheeks.

She looked at peace.

The sound of an early autumn breeze, the fluttering of curtains.

Silence.

*A single maple leaf naturally fell from the maple tree, carried away by
the wind. That was simply how nature worked.*

*The fate of an unremarkable extra in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ who went
unnoticed in the play may be nothing more than a falling leaf.*

*Unable to impress anyone or anything.*

*Insignificant and meaningless.*

*A life without the limelight.*

*But even those denied of their moment in the spotlight had stories of
their own.*

*The tale of Isaac was one such story, engraved deeply in my mind.*

Before his mother passed, Isaac, who had been crying and belittling
himself, resolved his will and set his sights on Märchen Academy.

Since he had no talent for magic, he delved deep into theoretical
studies, aiming to excel in theory.

After making careful choices and dedicating himself, Isaac succeeded in
entering Märchen Academy.

But that was merely a stroke of luck. When he entered the academy, Isaac
was pushed to his limits and realized how weak he truly was. He became a
mockery among the other students.

Isaac became even more frustrated when he looked at Ian’s growth, even
though they were both at Grade E mana.

In the end, during the academy’s vacation, Isaac embarked on a long
journey from which he would never return to this world, following his
mother.

The reason for Isaac’s disappearance midway through ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ was because he had gone missing.

An extra. Isaac was just that, an extra.

But even he had a story, a story about a man named Isaac.

***This moment was the prologue to a story that Isaac, a man who wanted
to rise from being an extra to a main character, never got to tell.***

The woman smiled and closed her eyes. I gently pressed my forehead
against hers and closed my eyes as well. We remained silent, enjoying
the gentle autumn breeze.

I bid farewell to the woman embarking on her final journey.

The cold wind penetrated through my winter clothes, freezing my entire
body.

But, regardless of the pain resembling a knife slicing my skin, I moved
forward.

My vision was filled with pitch-black darkness and a raging blizzard.

I could see a beam of light. All I needed to do was move forward without
hesitation.

I passed the trial by overcoming Isaac’s trauma. The world was falling
apart, and when I closed and opened my eyes, I found myself back in
reality.

My face was stiff. My lips had turned blue. My whole body was shaking,
and a chill ran down my spine.

All I could manage was a breathing noise in my mouth. My feet had
already gone numb, but I forced myself to continue, knowing that if I
stopped here, everything would come to an end.

The beam of light drew closer and closer. Many parts of my body were
already numb, and I felt the urge to collapse immediately. However, I
couldn’t stop since my destination grew closer and closer.

I closed my eyes while keeping my bearings. Despite being out of breath,
I continued walking, taking one step at a time.

When the darkness finally cleared, I could barely lift my heavy eyelids.

Pale blue mana swirled in the center of the room, with a navy-blue
scythe floating in the middle of it.

I fell forward as the sensation in my legs completely went away.

I crawled forward, scraping my hands across the icy floor. The thick
gloves kept bothering me, so I threw away my gloves and continued to
claw my way through the floor with my pale white hands.

As I lost the feeling in my fingers, I continued to crawl by using my
face and teeth to move forward.

Finally, I reached the source of the icy mana.

As a result, my body began rapidly freezing. Fortunately, my body had
reached a state where I didn’t need to move forward anymore.

My arms were numb. But the muscles in my forearm and shoulder should
still be usable.

I barely managed to raise my arm and reach for the Frostscythe.

My arm froze. The icy cold air tore through my skin, leaving me
frostbitten.

Still, I didn’t stop. I kept reaching out my hand while repeating, ‘Just
a little more, just a little more.’ to myself.

And then, finally, my hand…

…Pierced through the icy mana and made contact with the Frostscythe.

“I… got… it!”

Due to the frigid cold, I couldn’t even think straight, as even my head
started freezing. One side of my face had already been consumed by the
cold, distorting my expression.

Just the thought of grabbing the Frostscythe…

…made me smile with pride.

Chapter 57: - Ice Sovereign
===========================

**༺ Ice Sovereign ༻**

The summer breeze was slowly turning colder.

Dusk was slowly settling in.

\[Buu-, Buu-\]

The balloon demon, Heinkel the Hoarder, floated in the sky as if he were
a part of the clouds.

He was looking down at the magic circle in Ayla Forest. The silver-blue
haired man he had been keeping an eye on had entered that magic circle.

Heinkel wasn’t the least bit interested in the child of light. The light
element made him feel disgusted, the same way a human would feel at the
sight of a cockroach.

However, the silver-blue haired man was different. He possessed a plain
and unremarkable ice element. His indomitable will, which gave him the
courage to risk his life against the Thunderbird, was quite admirable.

\[Ah… bloody… nuisance…\]

A battle to the death with the silver-blue-haired man was his. His life
was also his.

Since he was a hindrance, he should just kill him. The justification was
good enough. Let’s leave the child of light to all the other demons. All
Heinkel needed to do was engage that man in a bloody duel.

\[Kehehe… hehe… bloodbath… mine… his life… mine…!\]

The face attached to his bloated body contorted, a grotesque grin
filling every inch of the face.

His mouth was dripping with saliva, just like a dog that found a tasty
treat.

\[Finally… time… come…\]

This puny balloon body was just a way to preserve his strength. Right
now, his body was in peak condition.

Jiiiiik────

Several parts of Heinkel’s balloon body popped, and a murky gas began to
seep out from the cracks.

As his body shrank, Heinkel transformed into a humanoid with a height of
4 meters.

The thick buffalo horns that had been hidden inside the balloon body
were revealed.

He had a sturdy, muscular body. However, sagging flesh drooped from his
wrist, sides, and ankles, as if forming bulges of flesh.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whooooosh───!*

The dense wind swirled around his body, elevating him in the air.

Heinkel began to rip off his sagging flesh. With a sound similar to that
of a stack of paper being torn apart, he clenched the torn flesh in one
of his hands as purple blood began to pour.

The wound healed in an instant.

The flesh quickly rotted and merged, forming a long spear. The sharp
blade of the spear caught the afterglow of the sun, which had yet to
sink under the horizon.

With well-defined features, Heinkel’s piercing eyes focused on the magic
circle.

\[Done.\]

A solemn voice rang through the air.

*Boom─!*

He sliced through the air towards the magic circle. The sound of an
explosion rang out. His speed was akin to that of a bullet.

There was only a gust of wind left behind in Heinkel’s wake.

\[I will face the Trial of Frost.\]

The active skill, \[Ears to Hear the Sound of Heaven\], was a skill that
allowed the user to hear anything at will, no matter the distance.

With the help of that, he recited the chant to enter the magic circle he
overheard from Isaac.

Heinkel’s body passed through the magic circle engraved in Ayla Forest.

Meanwhile, inside the cave of the Trial of Frost.

The blizzard that was raging inside the trial passage subsided.

Behind the Frost Dragon, the path leading to the Frostscythe had been
turned into an eerie passage that seemed to lead into the abyss.

It was because the man with red eyes had overcome the trial and claimed
the Frostscythe as his own.

\[Welcome, Ice Sovereign…\]

The Frost Dragon closed her eyes and recalled the request the Ice
Sovereign had made to her a thousand years ago.

***Can you suppress the Frostscythe until its new master has
appeared?***

The Frost Dragon happily accepted the request, saying that she also
wanted to play a part in the next generation of people that would change
the world.

Finally, at this moment, the potent coldness of the Frostscythe that had
been accumulated over the ages was in the hand of one man. There was no
longer a need to suppress the Frostcythe’s mana from invading the
islands and seas above.

It was a joyous occasion. For the first time in a long time, her heart
was fluttering.

\[…?\]

It was at that moment when Frost Dragon Hilde sensed another person at
the entrance. Her reptilian eyes, glowing pale blue, turned toward the
approaching intruder.

It was Heinkel, a 4-meter-tall, muscular demon wielding a black spear.

He walked across the icy floor with his large, clawed feet.

He scattered his dense mana while walking.

Around Heinkel’s body and spear was a dark green wind, a combination of
colors black and light green.

It was undeniably the darkness mana of a demon.

\[Who are you?\]

The voice of the Frost Dragon carried a deep sense of wariness.

\[White Dragon, I want. Scales, I want. Meat, I want.\]

Heinkel spoke in a monotone, emotionless voice, like that of a machine.

He lightly swung his mana-wrapped spear.

「Gale Fang (Wind Element, ★5)」 + 「Black Wind (Wind Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Wolf Fang (Wind Element)」

*Kwakakakkakaa───────!!*

In an instant, a storm came forth.

Like a pack of wolves pouncing and biting, the smoky dark green wind
attacked the mass of ice relentlessly with flawless precision.

The mass of ice was cut down in an instant, and the Frost Dragon was
helplessly attacked by \[Black Wolf Fang\].

It only left a few scratches on her pearly white scales.

\[…Big and hard.\]

Heinkel used his limited vocabulary to its fullest and kept his
impressions short.

It was sturdy, but that was about it.

The Frost Dragon had been suppressing the mana of the Frostscythe and
was dormant for thousands of years. As a result, she was currently in a
weakened state.

When the mass of ice began to crumble, the Frost Dragon was released.

She didn’t expect to be in this pitiful state when she was finally
walking on four legs again after such a long time.

\[You, stronger than me. But, you tired.\]

────── \[Kurururureu…\]

The Frost Dragon bared her teeth and began showing her animalistic
wariness.

Heinkel remained indifferent, taking on a battle stance. In the face of
his greed, it mattered little whether his opponent was a mythological
beast or a legend.

\[Reason, not curious. Only meat and scales, I want.\]

Heinkel leapt at the Frost Dragon with his spear wrapped in a dark-green
wind spell. In an instant, the icy floor shattered and wind scattered
around.

「Whirlwind (Wind Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Wind (Wind Element, ★5)」

= 「Thread of Death (Wind Element)」

*─────Whoooooooooosh────!!!*

The destructive power of the spear wrapped in the swirling black winds
of \[Thread of Death\] was at a level where it could even pierce the
sturdy scales of the Frost Dragon.

The Frost Dragon had no mana left to deploy a defensive spell. She would
certainly sustain deep wounds.

However, Heinkel’s attack did not reach the Frost Dragon.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Winter Hellfire (Ice Element)」

\[…!!\]

*Hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa─────*!!

The cold, dark blue flames raged onward. Its fierce momentum pushed
Heinkel’s body back. It was a direct hit.

He then rolled violently on the icy floor, regaining his balance and
standing up after a while. The frostbite that had spread along his body
quickly healed as he exerted his mana.

At that moment, an eerie sensation coursed through his body.

Behind the Frost Dragon, a thick chill flowed out from within the
darkness.

The corner of Heinkel’s mouth twitched.

In the passageway, the man with silver-blue hair he had been seeking was
striding out.

The man held a dark blue scythe in his right hand. Like the
personification of Death itself, he emitted a chilling aura filled with
murderous intent as he came out of the passage.

“…”

Inside the icy cavern that was as beautiful as a palace, pale blue mana
illuminated his figure, while the sharp blade of the scythe reflected
the light.

The Frost Dragon also turned her head to capture the sight with her
eyes. He was dressed in light robes, having apparently discarded the
cumbersome winter clothing.

Naturally, wizards were unaffected by their own magic. Therefore, the
fact that he didn’t feel the cold was evidence that the icy cold of the
Frostscythe was entirely his own.

The man with silver-blue hair lowered his gaze. Heavy mana pressed down
on Heinkel’s entire body. It felt like the pressure of the deep ocean
was trying to crush him.

Then, the man slowly raised his head.

Cold, blood-red eyes turned towards the demon.

“…’Heinkel the Hoarder’, is it?”

\[…!!\]

***My name, he knows.***

Heinkel felt chills run through his spine.

\[My name, how did you know…\]

Heinkel’s \[Clairvoyance\] allowed him to see things, no matter the
distance.

With \[Ears to Hear the Sound of Heaven\], no matter how far away it
was, he could hear it.

However, as Heinkel bore witness to the insurmountable power of the man
before him…

…He realized that he had been drunk with power, while being under the
man’s thumb all along.

\[Excellent…! Excellent! I want this…! A battle with you, a bloody
battle…!\]

Heinkel shouted in excitement.

The man only gave an indifferent response, as if he were looking at a
passing insect.

That demeanor, however, only fueled Heinkel’s fighting spirit even more.

***“Hilde.”***

The man with silver-blue hair held his left hand out towards Frost
Dragon Hilde. His wrist was engraved with an 8-star Familiar Contract
Circle.

***“Come to me.”***

An emotionless command came out of the man’s mouth. He couldn’t afford
to pay attention to his manner of speaking, as he was adjusting to the
Frostscythe’s chill.

\[…!\]

The Frost Dragon’s eyes widened.

That cold expression and icy voice… reminded her of the Ice Sovereign
who had been drifting through her dreams.

No matter how she looked at it, the aura emanating from him was
unmistakably similar to the Ice Sovereign. It was the ‘Authority of a
Ruler’ that couldn’t be explained in any other way.

\[Whew…\]

The Frost Dragon let out a faint laugh.

\[For a thousand years… I have been waiting for you, Ice Sovereign.\]

***I look forward to traveling the world with you again.***

***Is this the right time to use the expression ‘it feels like a
dream’?***

Her heart was pounding in her chest.

The Frost Dragon freed herself from the sense of duty that clung to her
like skin.

She accepted that man, Isaac, as her new master.

Hwaaaaaaaaaaa──────!!

The 8-star Familiar Contract Circle emitted an intense pale blue light.
The same hue of magic enveloped the body of the Frost Dragon.

Frost Dragon Hilde, the name of the 8-star magic beast in myths, and the
symbol of the Northern Duchy of Whiteclark.

At this moment, a pale blue familiar seal was engraved on that white
dragon’s forehead.

*Swiiiiiiiiiiish────*

The powerful mana of her new master immediately flowed into Hilde.

Unlike a minion, a familiar formed a close relationship through a formal
master-servant contract. As long as the master was of the same element,
it was possible for the familiar to receive mana from them.

Soon, Isaac stood in front of Hilde, facing Heinkel. The Frostscythe
glimmered with a chilling pale blue mana.

Behind him, Hilde had begun refining her mana.

As a familiar, Hilde’s magic was under the control of her master, Isaac.

This meant that the spell unleashed by Hilde would only devour her
enemies.

No harm would be done to the master unless they willingly accepted the
effects of their familiar’s spells.

A swirling icy cold air enveloped the surroundings. Hilde’s unique
skill, \[Frostwind\] had been activated. It increased the power of her
master’s ice magic and froze the bodies of their enemies.

It was a powerful blizzard that allowed Isaac to dominate the
battlefield.

────────── \[Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah──────!!!!\]

Hilde’s fierce roar shook the cave.

A frigid blizzard raged due to the effects of \[Frostwind\]. Heinkel’s
vision turned white.

Through the gap made by \[Frostwind\], the man’s blood-red eyes and the
dragon’s pale blue eyes could be seen.

\[This man, I want. White dragon, I want…! I WANT!!\]

Heinkel’s smile distorted into an exaggerated grin. To counter
\[Frostwind\], he poured out his mana.

Heinkel’s wind stirred. It was imbued with his unique element.

「Zephyr (Wind Element, ★4)」 + 「Serpentine Venom (Poison Element,
★5)」

= 「Toxic Zephyr (Wind + Poison Element)」

*Whooooooooosh─────────────!!!!*

The venomous violet winds engaged in a fierce battle against
\[Frostwind\], corroding Isaac’s flesh. It was a potent venom that could
bring death to any living being with a single breath.

However, Isaac simply lifted the Frostscythe once and slammed it into
the ground, dispersing Heinkel’s \[Toxic Zephyr\].

「Ice Sovereign’s Majesty(Ice Element, ★7)」

*Hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa──────!!*

A cold, light blue glow spread in all directions.

\[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\], a skill that repelled all magic directed at
the user. It only targeted magic that Isaac could handle, but he was
already far above Heinkel in terms of power.

The peak of the ice element, the Ice Sovereign’s overwhelming power
flowed out of Isaac.

Heinkel felt the heat rising from his chest. *Excitement!*
**Exhilaration!** ***How long had it been since he found an enemy that
made his heart race?***

\[Kahahahaha───!! As expected, I want this man! I want───!!\]

!

*Kuuung───!*

Heinkel used his mana to thaw his body, which had frozen by Hilde’s
\[Frostwind\], and leapt at Isaac with ferocious speed.

Just before Heinkel could stab Isaac with the spear enveloped by the
dark green wind spell \[Thread of Death\].

Isaac’s calm voice rang through the air.

“You’re… easier than I thought.”

Isaac lowered his gaze.

Heinkel made his first in-game appearance during the second semester of
the first year in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Heinkel was a demon that acted and moved on his own accord, regardless
of the orders from the Evil God. He played the role of a Joker-esque
demon, appearing as a variable in several episodes.

Heinkel’s power in the game was indescribable.

But in front of Isaac, who wielded the icy chill of the Frostscythe,
Heinkel was nothing more than a helpless weakling.

Isaac pointed the head of the Frostscythe at Heinkel. The magic circle
of \[Frost Explosion\] conjured before him.

The moment Heinkel’s spear was about to hit Isaac.

The magic of the Frostscythe devoured him.

「Flash Freeze (Ice Element, ★7)」

*Chaaraaak───────!*

In the blink of an eye, Heinkel’s body froze. The passive skill, \[Flash
Freeze\], rapidly froze anything that came near the Frostscythe.

Cold blasts of mana explosions erupted in succession from the magic
circle conjured in front of the scythe.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaa──────────────!!!*

It was a relentless onslaught of ice.

The cold blast fiercely shattered Heinkel’s already frozen organs.

The mass of ice ferociously expanded, encasing his mangled body like a
display piece.

His body that was within the ice mass had already shattered to pieces
along with the ice.

*Suuuuuurrrrrruuuu─*

The massive ice mass formed by \[Frost Explosion\] turned into a pale
blue powder before scattering into the air.

The corpse of the dead demon laid on the ground. Silver mana flowed from
the body, gathering in the air.

Heinkel the Hoarder turned into a gray powder and disappeared.

A concentrated aura flowed towards Isaac like a cloud of cigarette
smoke.

For a moment, his right eye turned silver before returning to red again.
Heinkel’s unique magic \[Clairvoyance\] was now imprinted onto Isaacs’s
right eye.

“…”

Isaac instinctually recalled the Frostscythe. In a process akin to
thawing, he reduced it into a pale blue powder and absorbed it into his
body.

It felt like a new storage cabinet had been created inside his body
where he could retrieve and store the Frostscythe at will.

He then turned to face Hilde.

Hilde closed her eyes, bent her front legs, and lowered her head.

With tears in her eyes, she bowed to her new master.

***\[Ice Sovereign.\]***

It was an emotional moment for Hilde.

***\[I thank fate for allowing me to meet you again…\]***

*Whooooooosh───*

Suddenly, Hilde transformed into pale blue mana and was forcibly
unsummoned. At that moment, Hilde was confused and uttered, ‘W-what just
happened?’

As soon as her physical form disappeared, the view of the cave started
looking unnecessarily large.

Isaac appeared to be in a difficult situation, as cold sweat trickled
down his face. It took a ridiculous amount of mana to keep Hilde
summoned.

As soon as the unique trait \[Hunter\] was deactivated, Isaac sensed an
immediate crisis from his rapidly depleting mana and quickly unsummoned
Hilde.

“Oh my…”

After Isaac’s undignified exclamation, the cave was filled with silence.

<span id="0057_58_-_Prologue_-_Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 58: - Prologue - Interlude
==================================

**༺ Prologue – Interlude ༻**

Right as Isaac passed the trial.

In the north, at the Whiteclark family mansion.

A woman with short, pink hair, Keridna Whiteclark, was screaming. Her
voice rang throughout the large family mansion.

“Sister! Sister Aichel!! Help me, it’s urgent!”

The life of an academy student named Isaac was at stake, and she was the
only one who knew about it.

Keridna couldn’t bear the thought.

Believing that Aichel might be able to save Isaac, Keridna continued to
search through the large mansion with the help of the maids for over 20
minutes.

It was crazy that no one knew where Aichel was.

***Where the hell is my sister hiding?***

Keridna reached her office. Although she had already checked and passed
by it earlier, something might have changed. Keridna knocked on the
office door.

“Sister Aichel!! Help! Someone is about to die!!”

“Who?”

“Aaaah!!”

When a calm voice appeared from behind her, Keridna turned around to
look at the owner of the voice, startled.

The woman she had been searching for stood there with a friendly smile.

It was Aichel Whiteclark, a mature beauty with neatly braided pink hair
wearing her dress uniform.

“Uh, Sis. I didn’t feel your presence…? What movement technique did you
use to walk here again?”

“I just walked here normally. You were just too distracted to notice.”

“Ugh…!”

Aichel opened the door, revealing a bland office furnished with only the
bare essentials.

However, a White Dragon emblem behind the desk that symbolized the
Whiteclark family was lavishly decorated.

“Uhm, more importantly…! Someone is dying right now…! Huh? He’s awake?”

Keridna closed her eyes to confirm that Isaac was still unconscious.

A strange scene unfolded before her as she activated \[Sight
Synchronization\]. While it was a relief that Isaac seemed to have
awoken, there was something peculiar about the situation.

“Uh…?”

Keridna was speechless as her eyes fell upon the figure of the White
Dragon. It was the unmistakable symbol of the Whiteclark family, the
mythical White Dragon.

Even more surprisingly, Isaac had extended his arm towards it, signing
an 8-star Familiar Contract Circle.

Keridna doubted her eyes. It was an unbelievable sight.

「Plunder (Neutral Element, ★4)」

“Wha!”

Suddenly, Aichel placed her hand on Keridna’s eyelids and casted a
spell. Taken back by the unexpected action, Keridna let out a startled
scream.

The neutral spell that allowed the user to steal the magic another
person was using, \[Plunder\].

It was generally impractical, as the caster had to have a deep
understanding of the magic being stolen.

Aichel, being exceptionally familiar with the Whiteclark family’s magic,
\[Sight Synchronization\], had a deep understanding of it. She could, as
a result, steal it as effortlessly as breathing.

Aichel closed her eyes and observed Isaac’s vision, which she had stolen
from Keridna, with her own eyes.

“Uh, sister!!”

“…”

Aichel extended her arm at the approaching Keridna. Seeing the serious
expression on her face, Keridna had no choice but to swallow her breath
and remain still.

“This is…”

Her sister had always playfully teased others with a friendly smile in a
carefree manner.

However, this was the first time Keridna had ever seen her have a
serious expression.

Reflected in Aichel’s vision was a large white dragon, an intimidating
scythe dripping with immense mana, and a menacing demon.

Soon, \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\] was triggered, and Isaac’s body
glowed.

*──────Pop!!*

“Argh!!”

With the sound of something popping, a large amount of blood started
streaming from Aichel’s closed eyes.

Covering her eyes, Aichel collapsed with a piercing scream. It was due
to the backlash of \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\] rejecting \[Sight
Synchronization\].

“Sister!!”

Keridna tried to catch her, but…

Aichel once again extended her arms, blocking her sister’s approach.

“Hu, I’m fine… It’s alright…”

She covered her eyes with her free hand. Thanks to her always-active,
high-leveled \[Basic Protection Magic\], her eyeballs had avoided
popping. However, she would suffer from the aftereffects for quite some
time.

Aichel spoke while trembling and breathing heavily in pain.

“Little sister. What… what absurd monster did you provoke…?”

“S-Sister…?”

Keridna’s entire body trembled uncontrollably from fear.

“I-I’m sorry…! I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m…!”

“I’m not scolding you.”

Suddenly, the corners of Aichel’s lips curved upward.

Keridna was caught off guard by that reaction.

“I’m praising you…”

Even as tears of blood streamed down her face, Aichel’s eyes widened
with joy.

An ear-to-ear smile stretched across her face, her eyes gleaming with a
red hue.

For the first time in her life, Keridna felt that her sister was creepy.

\* \* \*

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated \[Heinkel the Hoarder (Lv 155)\] and
gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 63!\] \[You have
gained 6 stat points!\] \[You have obtained the loot \[Heavenly
Bundle\]!\] \[The aura of \[Heavenly Bundle\] permeates you…\]
\[Congratulations! You have acquired the unique skill
\[Clairvoyance\]!\]

It felt like I was being bombarded by all sorts of things.

As I adjusted to the frigid chill that flowed into my body from the
Frostscythe, I felt heavily dazed. My mind wasn’t working properly,
either.

At the same time, when I laid my eyes on Hilde, I remembered the Great
Witch of Heaven’s Wrath who had given me the 8-star Familiar Contract
Circle.

So, I casually blurted out for her to become my familiar… I didn’t think
she would actually be willing.

I even calmly dealt with Heinkel the Hoarder.

‘Why did he come out here…?’

Only after adapting to the chill of the Frostscythe, and gradually
regaining clarity did I realize how confusing the current situation was.

Heinkel the Hoarder played a pivotal role akin to a catalyst in ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱, during the second-semester arc of the first year.

He was a demon known for his rebellious and self-righteous attitude,
acting independently while ignoring the orders of the Evil God Nephid.
His unpredictable nature made him an unexpected variable in many
stories.

The second semester hadn’t started yet, but he had already appeared and
been defeated by me.

I had also obtained the \[Clairvoyance\] skill.

Frostscythe, 8-star familiar, and even \[Clairvoyance\]…

‘What a fortunate turn of events.’

It felt like a buy one get one free type of deal.

Moreover… Hilde had called me ‘Ice Sovereign’. After thinking for a bit,
I could roughly guess the reason.

The 9-star passive skill I obtained from \[Fictional Hell\], \[Ice
Sovereign\]. Hilde must have sensed that and mistaken me for her master
from a thousand years ago.

***Does she think I’m the reincarnation of the Ice Sovereign?***

It seemed as though the Frost Dragon had a grandmotherly side and
believed in reincarnation.

‘So in the end, she misunderstood me and became my familiar?’

***You have truly seen my fate, oh Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath.***

To be honest, I was looking forward to forming a contract with an 8-star
familiar in a dramatic and grand manner.

An endgame familiar, no less.

However, I didn’t think it would look like this.

‘I’m sorry, Hilde.’

***I am not the Ice Sovereign… and I am certainly not their
reincarnation.***

As I was about to tell her that, a heavy feeling weighed upon my heart.
I couldn’t fathom the magnitude of betrayal and shock she would feel.
After all, she had spent a thousand years yearning for the Ice
Sovereign’s return.

Since I had made a familiar contract with her already, I hoped Hilde
would at least assist me until we dealt with the Evil God. After that, I
wouldn’t mind ending the contract.

‘Until I defeat the Evil God… should I pretend to be the reincarnation
of the Ice Sovereign?’

Or maybe it was better to be honest and admit the truth.

After racking my brain for a while, I decided to take a break and think
about it tomorrow. I was just too exhausted today.

I chose to abandon my winter clothes completely. They were deep within
the trial’s cavern, and I didn’t want to explore the darkness just to
find it.

Placing my hand on the magic circle, I infused a small amount of mana
and successfully returned to Ayla Forest. Now that Hilde was contracted
to me, I had gained the authority to access the trial’s cave. The
thought of this filled me with a sense of satisfaction and
accomplishment.

“Ah.”

As soon as I exited Ayla Forest, my legs gave out, and I fell to the
ground.

I felt weak. Despite the disappearance of the chill that had frozen my
body after gaining control of the Frostscythe, the damage still
remained.

My body still had traces of the freezing cold that almost took my life.
It was so bad I couldn’t even dismiss it with empty words. While I had
managed to freeze all the bleeding from the cuts on my skin, the sharp
pain coursing through my body was unavoidable.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

I created a sheet of ice on the ground and laid on it. It was painful
enough without having grass touching my wounds.

I silently gazed at the night sky, the celestial garden of shimmering
stars imprinting itself on my eyes. They were tranquil, gentle, and
faintly radiant.

Despite the complications that arose, it was an undeniably high-risk,
high-reward venture that yielded tremendous gains. Every bit of pain and
every wound I suffered all felt gloriously worthwhile.

“Really. It hurts like hell.”

I laugh silently in pain.

It was an unforgettable night.

‘I need to check on my progress.’

After passing the Trial of Frost, I received treatment in the academy’s
infirmary. When asked about what happened, I vaguely mentioned getting
injured during training.

When I returned to the dormitory, I fell into a deep sleep. I was so
tired.

Morning. Doris Hall, Low-Ranking Dormitory.

Leaning against the window with a cool morning breeze flowing through, I
gazed at my status screen while trying to organize my thoughts.

I invested my 6 newly acquired stat points into \[Learning Efficiency\],
which improved my skill mastery and knowledge acquisition rate.

I should be able to raise my \[Elemental Firepower\] from B- to B grade
soon. Thanks to my Grade A \[Magic Training Efficiency\], my growth was
quite impressive.

For reference, many students in Märchen Academy already had high
potential in \[Magic Training Efficiency\]. It was a prestigious
institution known for attracting naturally gifted individuals in magic,
after all.

Moreover, those students were working hard to improve themselves.

On the other hand, I had only recently achieved Grade A \[Magic Training
Efficiency\].

It was only due to the system feature in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ that
I was able to achieve rapid growth through defeating demons.

Naturally, I lagged behind other top-tier characters and Ian, who were
innately talented.

Even so, as I progressed through the grades, Isaac Coin would skyrocket.
In the first semester alone, I had raised my level by 43, while others
might’ve only raised it by a few.

Anyways.

‘I still have a long way to go before I can use Hilde…’

Even though I made a contract with Frost Dragon Hilde.

Without \[Hunter\] active, I lack the necessary mana to summon her.

My maximum mana capacity was 3200. However, summoning Hilde required an
astonishing 20000 mana. The difference between the two was over six
times.

Even if I summoned Hilde, the amount of mana required to maintain the
summoning would be staggering. It was unrealistic to summon Hilde with
\[Hunter\] inactive.

Well, the fact that I obtained an endgame familiar like Hilde was
already a remarkable achievement. It could only be acquired in the later
parts of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, but I managed to acquire it early
on.

If there’s anything I should be concerned about, it was…

‘I don’t know how to deal with her…’

There was no way I could sit still without talking to Hilde. Moreover,
she would likely be in a state of panic. She could probably sense that
my mana was incredibly small.

However, I was unable to summon her now, so that was impossible…

There was a way to decrease the necessary mana by reducing the size of
the familiar and the amount of mana it could tap into. However, even
with that method, I still could not summon Hilde with my current level.

In other words, it was hard for me to even talk to Hilde right now. I
had to figure out a solution to this problem.

The simplification of the skill list in the status window seems to be
because the number of acquired skills had increased. Now, I needed to
press \[Owned Skills &lt;&lt;Details&gt;&gt;\] to view my skills in
detail.

\[Owned Skills\] **Active**

– (★2) Ice Curtain (B-)

**Passive**

– (★9) Ice Sovereign

– (★7) Flash Freeze – (Locked)

The locked skills were conditional skills. I would be able to use them
again once I summoned Hilde’s Frostscythe.

This level of accomplishment at the end of the first-semester was
remarkable. I felt pride and excitement rushing over me at the thought
that I had completely disregarded the conventional teachings of ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

“Huff… ugh.”

But my mood quickly dropped. It was because of the Frostscythe.

In conclusion, I couldn’t use the Frostscythe with my current body. As
soon as the \[Hunter\] state was released, my mana circuit overloaded
from merely holding the scythe. It felt like my blood flow was
accelerating, causing my blood vessels to expand and burst.

Not only was I unable to use the Frostscythe’s magic properly, even
swinging it would cause my body to freeze.

In fact, wielding it against anything that wasn’t a demon would be
equivalent to suicide. It showed just how weak I was.

As expected of an ultimate weapon.

‘Should I give \[Clairvoyance\] a try?’

There was a strange mana lingering in my right eye. I let the mana flow.

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

I felt a peculiar sensation as if another me was created, one that was
unrestricted by space and time. I could manipulate this clone with my
mind and move it around.

As if I had mastered teleportation, my clone moved rapidly, causing my
vision to change with it swiftly. Struggling to focus my eyes caused me
to feel dizzy, so I tightly closed them.

The view currently captured by my right eye was of the distant hydrangea
garden. It was a weird sensation.

‘Ooh, this is amazing. What’s the limit to it?’

As I continued moving quickly, my vision started darkening. After going
a little further, I felt a violent pain in my right eye, with a headache
attached as a bonus.

“Ugh…!”

I released \[Clairvoyance\] and closed my right eye. It hurt like hell…
I wondered if this was how it would feel to undergo surgery without
anesthesia.

With \[Clairvoyance\] being Grade E, the name ‘Clairvoyance’ seemed
ridiculous, as I couldn’t see very far away.

Indeed, it was an undoubtedly useful and powerful skill, so I should be
happy to steadily increase its proficiency over time. However, using it
to monitor Alice… seemed to be quite challenging. I didn’t want to
experience the Extra Bad Ending No.11, \[Sudden Death\].

As the pain subsided, I took a breath and lowered the hand that held my
eye. Reflected in the mirror was my right eye, which had returned from
silver to its original color.

‘I just need to keep training \[Clairvoyance\]… As for the
second-semester scenario, hmm.’

I managed to take out both Leafa the Illusive and Heinkel the Hoarder,
who were supposed to appear in the second-semester, early on.

As a result, I had no idea how the second-semester would play out.

In the original scenario, during the \[Four Constellations\] arc in the
second-semester of the first year, Amy Holloway would use her bloodline
ability, \[Heart Color Discernment\], to see through Leafa’s hidden
intentions. Through her actions, Leafa was revealed as a demon, leading
to the \[Fictional Hell\] arc…

‘I’m not sure what’s going to happen.’

The Four Constellations would fight among themselves to win over Ian
Fairytale, the light element prodigy, but that was none of my business.

The biggest problem was Heinkel’s absence. He played the role of the
joker, creating variables in the first-year second-semester scenario. He
would manipulate the situation by pushing Ian into a corner or by
letting him escape.

It was unknown how the story would play out from now on. However, what I
needed to do wasn’t much different from before, killing demons and
preventing bad endings.

I might need to help Ian reach the minimum threshold to progress the
scenario, but that was

a problem for after summer vacation when Ian returned.

I waved my arm to turn off my status screen and stared out the window.

Throughout the trial, I felt the Evil God’s mana through my skin and
realized something new.

Clearly, I needed to continue training and getting stronger to defeat
her, but that wouldn’t be enough.

‘I’ll end up falling behind despite trying to get stronger, so what
should I do?’

If I wanted to immediately defeat the servant of the Evil God, Angra
Mainyu, I would need to be at least level 200 or possess the light
element. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to withstand Angra Mainyu’s
crimson mana, and I die.

However, it was safe to say that no human had reached level 200. In the
end, the only one capable of defeating Angra Mainyu was Ian, whose light
mana could block their magic.

Unfortunately, Ian Faintingtale was an SSS-Class Master Fainter with
terrible control, which made it much more realistic for me to defeat
Angra Mainyu by reaching level 200. Or I could somehow try to recruit a
level 200 companion and ask for their assistance.

But there was also the Apocalypse Dragon Azhi Dahāka and the Black Flame
Legion that must be stopped.

Of course, gathering power was always in the back of my mind, but… it
seemed I needed more power than I had expected.

‘Looks like I have one more task.’

It looked like I needed to attract several powerful allies that were
stronger than the current Dorothy before the Evil God’s resurrection.

***That will also be a long-term task…***

“Hi!”

“Woah, you scared me!”

Outside the window, a female student suddenly appeared from below.

Seeing a witch hat and purple hair startled me, reminding me of a horror
movie ghost. I backed away in surprise.

I thought my heart stopped there for a moment…

“Nyahaha! The President is so funny!”

***I’m weak to this sort of thing…***

I took a deep breath to calm my emotions and looked at Dorothy
Heartnova, floating in the air with starlight mana on her feet. “Oops”
she said, adjusting her posture and sitting on the windowsill, her legs
stretched into my room.

She was dressed in casual attire that showed off her fair shoulders. It
was nice to see in the morning.

“Senior, this is the men’s dormitory. You shouldn’t be here…”

“Don’t worry, I already have the maximum penalty! There’s nothing more
to lose!

She answered cheerfully while puffing air. It didn’t sound like
something to be proud of.

“What are you doing today, President? Let’s hang out.”

“I have to practice magic. There’s no time to play.”

Dorothy widened her eyes and glared at me.

“Training Freak.”

“Are you going to scold me?”

“If you don’t want me to, let me disturb you.”

“Now you openly admit that you’re going to disturb me… You usually
pretend not to.”

“President, this big sis is so sad. This so-called fan of mine doesn’t
even want to play with me when I want to.”

“Ugh, it’s because I can’t. Seriously…”

“Ah, you’re back to talking casually again.”

“…?”

As a faint smile appeared on her face, I was left speechless.

‘What is it?’

Did I ever talk to her like this? There were a few times when I did,
maybe subtly… once?

I couldn’t fully remember all the conversations I had with Dorothy.

There were probably times when I naturally and effortlessly spoke my
mind with her as if the words flowed like water. And, in all likelihood,
I wouldn’t even be conscious of it happening.

‘Did she care about such a thing?’

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Psychology:** \[★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆\]

Her psychology wasn’t readable, as usual.

“I’m just kidding. We shouldn’t disturb our diligent President, of
course!”

“But did you need anything? Coming to greet me in the morning and all.”

“I just felt like doing it today, for some reason.”

Dorothy smiled brightly. It was a meaningful smile.

“Nihihi, I’m off for now. See you later\~”

“Oh… sure.”

Dorothy wrapped herself in starlight mana and entered a state of
weightlessness, floating away into the distance.

I felt strangely… uncomfortable. It felt like her words contained
multiple emotions.

For a moment, I scratched my head and reflected on my conversation with
her.

…Suddenly, an absurd thought came to mind. It didn’t make sense for
Dorothy to have memories of the trial.

I shook my head and changed into my gym clothes before leaving the
dormitory.

A cluster of fluffy clouds drifted quietly in the sky. They didn’t look
like rain clouds this time.

Chapter 59: - Carriage Driver (1)
=================================

**༺ Carriage Driver (1) ༻**

\[Does that mean the next Ice Sovereign has been chosen?\]

In the northern region, the Whiteclark Duchy.

The Whiteclark family had several secrets that could shake the Zelver
Empire to its core. The family magic \[Sight Synchronization\] was one
such example, but even that was merely the tip of the iceberg.

Aichel Whiteclark, the eldest daughter and heiress of the Whiteclark
Ducal family was a person of interest. She had a strong backing that
solidified her position.

In reality, even her apparent position was not sufficient enough to
evaluate her.

There was a roundtable conference room in the basement of the Whiteclark
mansion.

Despite the lavishly decorated exterior, the space was dark, with only a
few luminescent lamps on the walls casting a faint glow.

There, Aichel stood upright at one end of the roundtable, head bowed.

One of the luxurious seats was particularly bright, illuminated by the
figure of an adult man formed of lightning mana.

Noble in demeanor, he propped his elbows on the armrests and lightly
rested his chin on clenched fists.

“Yes, Lightning Elemental King.”

Aichel’s voice rang softly. She had an eyepatch over her right eye,
which had yet to heal.

The lightning-formed figure was an Archwizard and the Elemental King of
Lightning.

It belonged to the man called the ‘Lightning Sovereign’, given his
position as the ‘Lightning God’. It was like a remote-controlled puppet.

The sovereigns of each element were known as the Elemental Kings, and
each person was like a nation, military, and law in itself.

They have built and governed their own country, their influence so
strong that it could shake the entire world through sheer military
might. The Zelver Empire was no exception.

For this reason, throughout its centuries-old history, the Zelver Empire
had maintained a friendly attitude whenever Elemental Kings appeared.

There had been various conflicts throughout history, but it had become a
fully entrenched tradition.

\[I was puzzled after seeing the letter… How did the other Elemental
Kings react?\]

“It appears that they consider it a mere agenda item for the next
Council of Kings. They see it as nothing more than a noteworthy human
with exceptional magical talent in the ice element, paying it little
attention.”

And if it were known that the Elemental Kings gathered for a roundtable
meeting every three years…

The world beyond the Empire would be terrified. The Elemental Kings were
the pinnacle of all wizard affiliations. In this world, wizards were the
strongest existences, and within the Zelver Empire, Archwizards were
above the law.

Among those scattered around the world, the people served by demihumans
and monsters of each element naturally came to be called Elemental
Kings, and ended up founding nations of their own.

Due to the immense power and potential danger associated with the
Elemental Kings, they had agreed to hold periodic meetings under the
pretext of fostering harmony. In reality, however, these council
meetings served as a means to check and balance each other.

Aichel, the next heiress to the Whiteclark family who could stand as a
neutral party, was chosen as the host.

She was competent, had excellent support, and had a high noble status,
all while being a promising candidate for the next Grand Duchess of the
Empire’s northern region. Above all, her love for peace had garnered the
unanimous support of the Elemental Kings.

\[I had the same thoughts at first, but my curiosity got the better of
me. A new candidate for the ‘Ice Sovereign’, a position that has been
vacant for a thousand years… you must know the significance of this.\]

“Yes, I do.”

\[Will you show me? I want to see the Ice Sovereign candidate you spoke
of with my own eyes.\]

Aichel meekly nodded and placed a finger on her forehead.

Mana slowly emanated from her finger. The process was akin to pulling a
video out of her head.

Then, Aichel flicked her finger towards the center of the roundtable.

The memories in her head began playing in front of the Lightning
Sovereign, the Elemental King of Lightning.

「Sight Synchronization Playback (Neutral Element, ★0)」

They were the memories seen through the eyes of a man via the Whiteclark
family’s bloodline magic, \[Sight Synchronization\], which had been
stolen from Keridna a few days ago.

In the video, the vision’s owner held the Frostscythe in his hand.

The mythological white dragon, Frost Dragon Hilde, had become his
familiar.

The Lightning Sovereign’s eyes widened in astonishment at that scene.

Then, as the man was fighting a roughly four-meter tall demon, he
activated \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\].

In a flash, the video disappeared.

Silence lingered for a while. The Lightning Sovereign stroked his chin,
lost in thought, before finally opening his mouth to speak.

\[Is he…?\]

“His name is ‘Isaac’, the next candidate for Ice Sovereign that I talked
about. A commoner with silver-blue hair, red eyes, and no family name.
He is currently a first-year student in the Zelver Empire’s Märchen
Academy.”

\[Hmm, a student?\]

There was a hint of surprise in his dignified tone.

A mere first-year academy student.

It was obvious that Isaac was an immensely talented young man. However,
his innate magic talent alone wasn’t a big deal.

The most important factor was the recognition of the mythological magic
beast and Frostscythe, once ruled by the Primordial Elemental King. This
was a problem far beyond their expectations.

It meant that Isaac, a mere commoner, was more suited to be the Ice
Sovereign than anyone else.

\[Märchen Academy… I’ve heard news of several recent demon appearances.
There were even reports of an unknown monster killing them. I inevitably
noticed that the Zelver Imperial Knights were mobilized. Was the kid
that monster?\]

“From the information I gathered, it’s clear that he is hiding his
identity.”

\[A Magic Cloak of Disguise?\]

“Yes, most likely.”

The events that had occurred at Märchen Academy surfaced after the
school year ended, involving even the Imperial Knights.

The frequent demon appearances, the wizard monster slaying them, and
even the Child of Light, Ian Fairytale.

\[Is his purpose… to protect the Child of Light and the people…? Well,
there is no point in speculating among ourselves. Nothing is certain.\]

\[I’ll admit, it’s an interesting piece of information. That child will
surely reach the realm of an Archwizard. I dare say it’s beyond simply
‘promising’, he is practically guaranteed to be the next Ice
Sovereign.\]

As the Lightning Sovereign spoke, Aichel held back her words. He didn’t
miss her reaction.

\[What is it, Aichel?\]

“…The source of the information is my younger sister, Keridna
Whiteclark. Based on what she has told me, the candidate for the next
Ice Sovereign is infamous for having grade E mana, which is… the lowest
level.”

\[…\]

“Just before the first semester ended, he looked weak.”

The Lightning Sovereign immediately guessed what she was trying to say.

\[Is it possible that he is suppressing mana?\]

Manipulating the maximum mana capacity.

It was equivalent to controlling every single cell in the body at will.
As ridiculous as it is, it was possible for those at the level of an
Archwizard that had transcended the limits of humanity, like the
Lightning Sovereign.

And a first-year academy student named Isaac could already control his
maximum mana capacity.

If anyone were asked who the greatest genius in the continent was, they
would say ‘Dorothy Heartnova’.

Regarded as a prodigy blessed by the heavens, Dorothy Heartnova had even
formed a contract with the Star Fairy Stella. It was anticipated that
within the next ten years, she would easily reach the realm of an
Archwizard. Even this level of talent was considered exceptional, near
the level of the Primordial Elemental King.

But Isaac, a commoner… was already far beyond that?

Tension filled the basement. One of the most powerful individuals in the
world was silently admiring a man named ‘Isaac’, a man with talent
superior to his own.

\[If he were to become the Ice Sovereign, I can only imagine how
powerful the Ice Empire will become. Even the Frost Dragon and
Frostscythe recognized him as their master, so those ferocious monsters
would likely be no exception…\]

Isaac. It was obvious to anyone in the know that he would eventually
become an Archwizard and ascend to the position of the Elemental King.

There were countless ice demihumans and magic beasts that had evolved
violently in the chaos that would regain order by welcoming a new
master. They had been waiting only for a new master to lead them.

Among those, there were some they had to be particularly cautious of.

“You mean… ‘Glacial Bear Barbatoma’, ‘Frost Spirit Merphil’, and
‘Icebound Crocodile Tugaros?’”

The Lightning Sovereign nodded.

For over a thousand years, each of those beings developed their strength
and joined the ranks of those who could change heaven and earth.

Glacial Bear, Frost Spirit, and Icebound Crocodile.

If those sinister and powerful monsters were to unite under the
leadership of Isaac.

As the master of the Frost Dragon and Frostscythe, and with his
overwhelming innate magic talent, the extent of Isaac’s authority would
be beyond imagination.

\[What are your thoughts on this?\]

Aichel closed her eyes to gather her thoughts before opening them and
expressing her opinion.

“Personally, I believe that this man, Isaac, entered Märchen Academy in
anticipation of the frequent unexplained demon appearances. Perhaps… he
was born with a heroic disposition, willing to sacrifice himself for the
sake of others.”

Aichel couldn’t hide her desires from revealing themselves.

“I am a lover of peace. If a man with a strong sense of self-sacrifice
like him were to become the ruler of those natural disasters and
calamities, bringing about change and order.”

Aichel’s obsession with peace was clearly visible to the Lightning
Sovereign.

“Then I couldn’t be happier.”

She had no idea who Isaac was, his hobbies, ideal type, or favorite
foods, and she didn’t care.

Aichel only looked at the objective truth.

The fact that a man named Isaac was killing demons and saving people.

“If Isaac is what I expect him to be… It is my personal hope that he
rises to the position of Ice Sovereign and stands shoulder to shoulder
with the noblest Elemental Kings of old.”

For a thousand years, the position of Ice Sovereign had remained vacant.

So, on the day Aichel was struck by \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\], she was
delighted to learn about Isaac, a promising candidate for the title of
Ice Sovereign, and also a means to restrain those monsters of ice.

\[…I understand your intention.\]

The Lightning Sovereign calmly answered.

\[This was good information. I’m glad I let my curiosity get the better
of me.\]

Having said so, the lightning mana forming the Lightning Sovereign
dispersed into the air.

Aichel bowed her head.

Meanwhile,

The Lightning Nation, ‘Zabrok’.

In the grand hall of the majestic castle, there was a luxurious purple
and gold throne, colors that symbolized Zabrok.

Wearing a sleek robe, the man sitting on the throne opened his eyes. His
purple hair was neatly swept back, his eyes glowing with dense lightning
mana.

“Balkan.”

\[Yes! Lord Lightning Sovereign!\]

As the man’s dignified voice rang through the air, the lightning mana in
front of throne condensed, taking the form of an indigo gorilla. It was
Balkan, a 6-star familiar with lightning mana constantly flowing from
its shoulders.

Balkan bent a knee and lowered its head, saluting its master.

“I shall go to the Zelver Empire, to Märchen Academy. Go through the
necessary formalities immediately.

The dignified voice of the Lightning Sovereign subsided.

Isaac. He wanted to confirm with his own eyes.

The Lightning Sovereign had made a decision.

\* \* \*

“Eden, will you please not call me ‘Rider Isaac’?”

\[Kyuuu!\]

I was feeling excited and tried talking nonsense with Eden, my little
golem familiar. I was grateful when he responded with a smile.

Now that I had the Frostscythe, I began my part-time job as a ‘carriage
driver’.

As mentioned earlier, a ‘carriage driver’ in this context referred to a
profession that used mana to operate a magical carriage.

That was not to say that there weren’t basic horse-drawn carriages. It
was just that mana-powered carriages were favored on the grounds of the
Märchen Academy.

By the way, when the students returned home from vacation, they probably
took a basic horse-drawn carriage for its reliability.

Anyways, I was wearing rugged carriage driver attire and had rented a
small carriage.

Carriage driving was a job greatly affected by \[Elemental Efficiency\]
while simultaneously improving \[Elemental Efficiency\] itself. It was
the perfect side job for a Märchen Academy student like me.

Of course, I had to practice driving the carriage for a few days and
gain the recognition of the stablemaster in order to work as a carriage
driver, so I diligently drove the carriage for the past several days.
Since I was familiar with the layout of the academy grounds, finding my
way around was not a problem.

“It’s the summer vacation, so there are few people.”

Eden chimed in with a playful ‘Kyuu!’ sound from the side.

I was at the carriage station. It used to be bustling during the
semester but it was now quiet. There were only a few carriages
available. Most of the students left the Academy during the vacation, so
there was no reason for the coachmen to stay here either.

In other words, the supply of carriage services was very small.

However, with the several commercial districts on Academy grounds and
significant numbers of students remaining at the Academy, the carriages
would be in demand.

But for some reason, the carriage wasn’t getting any customers.

“Well. Eden, let’s get to business.”

\[Kyuuung!\]

My worries were short-lived.

After all, business is originally something you had to work hard for.

So, I decided to make my move.

<span id="0059_60_-_Carriage_Driver_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 60: - Carriage Driver (2)
=================================

**༺ Carriage Driver (2) ༻**

I climbed into the front of the carriage and grabbed the stick-shaped
handle. Channeling mana through it allowed me to share my senses with
the carriage, serving as a link between us.

And now, by releasing mana and pushing the handle forward…

My mana will drive the carriage onwards.

“This is great\~”

The higher one’s \[Elemental Efficiency\], the smoother the ride would
be.

Additionally, I was a student of Märchen Academy. Even if it had only
been one semester, I had received a thorough education and honed my
magical skills.

To be slightly boastful, my carriage would provide customers with a very
steady and comfortable ride.

I drove the carriage with Eden by my side, feeling refreshed by the
light summer breeze brushing against my skin.

As I continued forwards, the sight of people dressed in white knightly
attire became increasingly common. They were the Imperial Knights that
had been dispatched to investigate the frequent demon appearances.

While the academy had a strict rule against interference from outside
forces, this incident was of such importance that the imperial family
had done so regardless.

I could clearly imagine the extent of the academy staff’s current
suffering. It was truly pitiful.

‘I’m sure they’ll manage.’

I just had to take care of my job.

Before I knew it, the carriage had arrived at the commercial district.
This place had a significant amount of traffic.

The people here were citizens of the Zelver Empire, living independently
within the economic system established by the academy.

With the spirit of capitalism filling me, I shouted a promotional slogan
at them, smiling brightly.

“You will never experience a carriage like this! You won’t even be able
to tell if it’s a bed or a carriage! I promise a smooth and comfortable
ride operated by a Märchen Academy student!”

\[Kyuu, kyuu!\]

Following my promotional slogan, Eden’s cry mixed in with my own voice,
causing a resonant effect. It was like watching an addictive on
television.

Following the mention of a carriage ride operated by a Märchen academy
student, the attention of nearby passersby was drawn to me. Their
interest was also partly fueled by the rarity of someone simultaneously
promoting while operating a carriage.

“Student! Give me a ride, please!”

My first customer was a cheerful-looking older woman.

She was the chatty type, expressing her disappointment that students
wouldn’t frequent her bakery as of late. Playing along, I engaged in a
lively conversation with her.

“Thank you, student! Maybe it’s because you’re a Märchen Academy
student, but the ride was really comfortable\~”

“Thank you for choosing us!”

Being a carriage driver was a performance-based job. I would subtract
the rental fee for the carriage and a percentage of the earned gel,
keeping the rest for myself.

Because I had to balance my training and part-time work, I needed to
earn as much gel as possible in the shortest amount of time. That was
how salesperson Isaac came into existence.

“You will never experience a carriage ride like this! You won’t even be
able to tell if it’s a bed…!”

“Student! Over here!”

“Alright!”

My publicity stunt had a tremendous effect. Everywhere I went, people
were eager to hop on, some merely out of curiosity. It was rare for a
Märchen Academy student to be working as a carriage driver, but even I
was fascinated by how much interest there was.

I was already welcoming my 8th customer, a mother and daughter. As we
rode to our destination, the 2-year-old child’s continuous crying
increasingly flustered the mother.

“I’m sorry, student. My daughter just won’t stop crying…. you have to
stop, okay baby?”

“WAHHHHHHHH!!!”

The sound of the baby’s cries echoed like a siren. It was clear she
would grow up to be strong.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

“WAHHH… ah…?”

As I cast \[Ice Generation\] in the air and immediately dispelled it, a
blue powder started raining down.

Inside the moving carriage, the baby looked on in fascination as the
beautiful powder floated out the window.

As it began to vanish, the baby reached both arms toward the window, her
gaze filled with wonder. I continued forming more and more powder to
keep the baby occupied.

“Phew. Thank you, student.”

“It was nothing special.”

It was just a service. Beside me, Eden agreed with a \[Kyuu!\].

It seemed they had business with Märchen academy’s administrative
office, as one of the staff members was the mother’s younger sister.
They had come to see her in person and have some tea together, as they
hadn’t been able to find time to meet as of late.

Unfortunately, she likely wouldn’t be able to get what she wanted. The
academy’s staff… were currently overwhelmed with a number of issues.

“…”

After bidding farewell to the mother and daughter, I stared intensely at
Bartos Hall. Memories from the Trial of Frost resurfaced, evoking mixed
emotions.

Of course, I had things to worry about besides them.

‘I want to try using \[Clairvoyance\] for surveillance purposes.’

I wanted to use \[Clairvoyance\] to monitor Alice as much as possible.
However, directly watching Alice would be a dangerous endeavor that
could lead to Extra Bad Ending \#11, \[Instant Death\].

Her Cheshire had an exceptional ability to sense the presence of others.
If I were to use \[Clairvoyance\] on Alice directly, Cheshire would
immediately sense the eerie gaze directed at its master and come to kill
me.

‘She’s not here right now, anyways.’

Alice had returned home, so I used \[Clairvoyance\] to peep inside the
student council room, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Well, it was something to think about later.

I began driving the carriage once more.

As night fell, I parked the carriage at the station and calculated the
day’s earnings, which were quite substantial. At this pace, I would only
need to work for about 3 weeks to gather enough gel for both my living
expenses and tuition.

After my training, I fell into a deep sleep at my dormitory.

Immediately after I awoke the next morning, I extended my left arm
forward. The 8-star familiar contract circle engraved on my left wrist
had turned into a summoning circle, and had been hiding its trace ever
since.

Focusing on the flow of mana inside, I visualized the form of Frost
Dragon Hilde.

Suddenly, the familiar summoning circle on my left arm revealed itself,
emitting an azure light.

I experienced a similar sensation to when I had summoned Eden. However,
as if a large barrier was blocking the path, the being within simply
couldn’t break though.

“Damn…”

I lowered my arm. I was trying to summon Hilde, just in a smaller form.
To do so, I was exhausting my mana to its limits every morning.

According to the setting of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, when a familiar
was unsummoned, it transformed into pure mana and entered the
contractor’s heart. Because of this, I knew it was possible to summon a
smaller manifestation of one’s familiar.

In other words, mana consumption could be reduced by decreasing the size
and presence of familiars with the same element. However, this ability
heavily depended on the contractor’s level and \[Elemental Efficiency\].

Considering my current level and skill with \[Elemental Efficiency\], it
would be impossible to summon the Frost Dragon, even in a very small
form.

“I want to talk to her.”

After contemplating for a while, I had already decided on what I would
say to her.

I would tell her the truth about everything, and I would ask for her
help.

After all, I didn’t want to deceive her while exploiting her power.

While those thoughts were still endlessly being transmitted to the Frost
Dragon, I couldn’t speak directly to her.

For now, I should just focus on my carriage driver duties.

I resolved to try and summon Hilde again tomorrow.

Changing into my uniform, I left the dormitory.

……

It was the 5th day of working as a carriage driver.

Today, the atmosphere was rather unusual. The academy staff’s presence
was one thing, but even the Imperial Knights seemed preoccupied.

I was able to quickly find the cause.

‘The Lightning Sovereign?’

He was an Archwizard dubbed the Elemental King of Lightning. It seemed
he was currently visiting Märchen Academy under the guise of an
investment.

The present Märchen academy was known to be losing investors due to the
frequent appearance of demons, which meant that the coin graph of the
academy’s coffers was linearly declining.

However, there were rumors that high-ranking members of the nobility,
such as the imperial princess, Saintess, and even the Priestess would be
attending next year.

It wasn’t strange for the Lightning Sovereign to discover this and
attempt to invest in Märchen Academy at their lowest point.

Even so, there was an issue.

‘Why is he coming in person?’

Sending a messenger would have sufficed, so why?

There was no mention of this in the ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ following
the summer after freshman year.

It felt as if both the Imperial Knights and academy staff were tense,
suspecting a hidden reason behind his visit.

To begin with, the Lightning Sovereign wasn’t an evil or good person.
Because he always remained neutral, coming in person wasn’t a problem.

However, since something had changed from the original story, I couldn’t
take it lightly. Something had definitely gone wrong.

It wasn’t the time for me to be driving around a carriage. Parking the
carriage in a faraway alley, I hid it and activated \[Clairvoyance\].

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

I observed what was occuring at the main entrance of the academy. The
Imperial Knights and academy staff were lined up, bowing their heads.
Only few nobles would receive such treatment, like the imperial princess
of the royal family, or the Saintess, who served the Lord, Manhalla. Or…
someone like the Elemental King.

An opulent, deep violet and vibrantly golden carriage passed by the
academy’s main entrance. It was so grand it made my own carriage feel
insignificant.

That opulent carriage was accompanied by guards dressed in matching
purple military uniforms.

His servants opened the door, and one man stepped out from within.

The man wore a black robe, his aura overpowering. His short, violet hair
exuded elegance, and his gaze innately shimmered with static
electricity.

‘It’s really the Lightning Sovereign.’

Why was this guy here?

Every imperial knight present, led by vice commander Fenrir of the 4th
division, saluted the Lightning Sovereign.

As the commander of the imperial knights was currently in the Imperial
Capital, Viyans, the vice commander was the highest-ranking knight in
the area.

The Lightning Sovereign was completely indifferent to the imperial
knights’ actions.

Suddenly, he gazed in my direction.

“…!”

I immediately terminated \[Clairvoyance\].

‘Fuck!’

***This is bad…!***

Feeling uneasy for some reason, I had planned to briefly observe, but I
was caught instantly.

I needed to come up with an alibi immediately.

Hurriedly driving the carriage away, I summoned Eden and shouted out my
usual business slogans as if I had always been operating the carriage.

“You will never experience a carriage ride like this! You won’t even be
able to tell if it’s a bed or a carriage! I-I promise it won’t even
s-shake…!”

*BOOM───!*

“Wahh!!”

However, he closed in like a flash of lightning.

A real lightning bolt struck down in front of me, forcing me to stop the
carriage.

In the spot the lightning struck, the Lightning Sovereign appeared
instantaneously.

\[Jaul Dragoniac\] **Lv:** 199

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** ???

**Psychology:** \[???\]

Multiple sparks rippled across the air as he stared at me with a
composed gaze, charged with lightning.

Cold sweat flowed down my body.

***I’m fucked…***

\* \* \*

As the Zabrok carriage entered the gates of Märchen academy, the
Lightning Elemental King Jaul Dragoniac felt the presence of magic.

“Lord Lightning Sovereign?”

“…Wait for a moment.”

*Spark–*

As an Archwizard, Jaul had the ability to transform himself into the
form of elemental magic, also known as elemental transformation.

Upon witnessing him transform into the lightning element, the imperial
knights were briefly filled with terror.

“I’ll be right back.”

Immediately after saying that, he flew into the sky.

Becoming lightning, he quickly followed the presence of that spell and
reached Isaac, who had been using \[Clairvoyance\], in a flash.

“Hmm?”

Jaul narrowed his eyes.

Possessing silver-blue and red eyes, he was the one Aichel had
mentioned.

He had found the magic unusual, but to think it was him.

‘I never thought we would meet so soon.’

He could sense an aura far beyond his imagination. The boy in front of
him was, without a doubt, the candidate for the next Ice Sovereign.

Why he was wearing a uniform and operating a carriage… he didn’t know.

Still, he was someone who had predicted the frequent emergence of demons
and enrolled in Märchen Academy, secretly eliminating the threats while
keeping his identity hidden.

It wasn’t likely that he was operating a carriage to earn money, or
because the fine mana control required would help him better control his
own.

The reason Jaul wanted to see Isaac personally was because he had a
discerning eye.

He wanted to see for himself. Who Isaac really was, how much power he
had, and whether their values aligned.

Depending on how he viewed Isaac and what his decision turned out to be,
his reason for coming here would undoubtedly change.

As planned, he would speak with Isaac. The best method to do so would be
utilizing the carriage Isaac was driving around.

“Give me a ride.”

“…Huh?”

Jaul used a commanding tone, making it clear that he wouldn’t allow a
refusal.

“Y-Yes! Welcome, valued customer!”

Isaac responded respectfully while sweating, judging that he should
comply with the Lightning Sovereign’s wishes.

“I-I promise you a comfortable ride without any shaking!”

Ignoring Isaac’s promotional slogan, he simply got in the carriage.

The environment inside was much more cramped and far less luxurious than
the Zabrok carriage Jaul had ridden in.

Well, it didn’t matter to him. With his arms gathered and legs crossed,
he stared at the front window, where he could see the back of Carriage
Driver Isaac’s head.

“Drive with grace. Our destination is the main entrance of the Academy.”

“Y-Yes!”

Isaac started driving the carriage towards the entrance.

As he did so, Jaul’s eyes sparked with more static electricity as his
gaze narrowed.

‘I knew it…’

How could he not know the nature of the ethereal blue aura emanating
from Isaac?

To those who had reached the pinnacle of each element, a prominent aura
corresponding to their element would be emitted.

The Fire Elemental King, the Water Elemental King, and the Wind
Elemental King. Isaac, who was currently in front of him, was similar to
them.

If he had reached the level of an Archwizard, he might even possess the
ability to see the truth of all things, similar to Dorothy Heartnova’s
\[All In the World\].

What lay within Isaac was an immense entity adorned with countless eyes,
capable of devouring anything and everything in the world.

A monster that possessed near infinite mana.

\[ ■■■. \]

***Be gone.***

As the monstrous entity within Isaac spoke, Jaul felt a chill run down
his spine.

To think that he, one of the strongest of all lightning element
wielders, had briefly felt fear. How long had it been?

However, paradoxically, the amount of mana he could sense from Isaac was
disproportionately small. Jaul possessed a transcendent mana perception
that could detect even unreleased mana, allowing him to gauge Isaac’s
maximum mana capacity.

‘What in the world is this boy…?’

As Jaul stroked his chin, he pondered to himself.

He was the master of the Frost Dragon and Frostscythe.

He possessed an aura that could only be reached by reaching the pinnacle
of the ice element.

And he had an unknown existence hidden deep within him.

Was it possible for someone who possessed that monstrous entity, whose
strength was beyond compare, to have such a pathetic amount of mana? Did
that even make sense?

In other words, as he had discussed with Aichel before, it was certain
that Isaac had manipulated his maximum mana reserves, probably to
conceal his true identity. Similar to himself, he was likely at the
level of an Archwizard.

It was worth coming all the way to the academy just to confirm this
fact.

Having learned how terrifying he was, he needed to verify something,
even if it meant using force.

Was Isaac a threat or a potential ally? The answer would determine his
future actions.

“Are you a student?”

“Huh? Y-yes.”

“What’s your name?”

“It’s Isaac.”

“You don’t seem to have a last name.”

“Y-yes, because I’m a commoner…”

“What do you plan to do after you graduate?”

“Ah, I want to be a wizard. That’s why I joined the Department of Magic
here.”

He felt annoyed that someone like him was pursuing such a boring career
path.

Because of that, he changed the direction of his questioning.

“What kind of wizard do you want to be?”

“What?”

“There are many options as a wizard. You could become a court wizard for
a noble, you could research in the Magic Tower, become a mercenary or an
explorer… And even within these paths, you will be further divided based
on your own beliefs and values. Wizards who wield magic to protect
others will inevitably be divided from those who use magic for their own
selfish desires. When I ask you what kind of wizard you wish to become,
that is what I am asking.”

Following his speech, the only noise that could be heard was the sound
of the carriage wheels turning.

After a brief but deep thought, Isaac responded.

“I haven’t decided on a specific path, but I have decided on what kind
of wizard I want to be. It might sound funny to you…”

If Isaac were to continue existing in this world after defeating the
Evil God Nephid, he would become a wizard to sustain his livelihood.

So, what kind of wizard did he wish to become? It might seem like he was
putting the cart before the horse, but after the Trial of Frost, Isaac
had come to a complete conclusion.

“I want to be a wizard that people can be proud of.”

He responded with a smile on his face.

During the final test within the Trial of Frost, he had recalled his
mother in Korea.

His mother, who had constantly told him to stop drinking carbonated
drinks because it was bad for him.

His mother, who constantly nagged him out of worry.

His mother, who constantly made side dishes for him and left them in the
refrigerator.

His mother, who always prepared the foods he loved whenever he came
home.

His mother, who sent him messages to tell him she loved him from time to
time.

His mother, who had believed in him until the end.

She had died while he was studying for the civil service exam.

The moment his world collapsed overlapped with the final test of the
Trial of Frost.

At that moment, he determined that if he was going to live on, he would
become someone that would make his mother feel proud.

“…I see.”

Jaul closed his eyes.

Isaac’s values and actions seemed to be in line with his reply, and
there was no indication that he was lying.

Thus, he was satisfied.

Although they still had a ways to go before reaching the main entrance,
it seemed it was time for him to leave.

*Spark────!*

“Huh?!”

Jaul, taking the form of lightning once more, left through the window.
Startled, Isaac instinctively cried out for his gel, but Jaul was
already too far away.

*Crash───!*

A bolt of lightning struck down in front of the Academy’s main gates.
While the academy staff and imperial knights were shocked, the Zabrok
escorts maintained an expression of indifference, clearly familiar with
the sight.

The lightning bolt turned into elemental mana, taking the form of Jaul.

With an impassive expression, he moved to his carriage.

“I got what I wanted. Let’s move.”

“Yes, my Lord!”

As soon as Jaul got on, accompanied by his escorts, they began to move
again.

The imperial knights and academy staff could only stare in dazed
astonishment.

Inside, Jaul sat in a luxurious spot as he silently gazed at the
academy’s scenery. Opposite him, a female knight named Hera sat with her
sword resting on her lap.

“I’m glad I came here in person. It wasn’t a waste.”

“Did you meet the next potential Ice Sovereign?”

Jaul nodded.

“We… shouldn’t make him our enemy.”

That creature, possessing immeasurable strength akin to an endless
abyss, was a secondary issue.

While he was confused by Isaac’s thought process, which was no different
from an ordinary student, considering his immense strength, he must have
been hiding something

“Still, he wasn’t a bad person.”

If, one day, he appeared in front of the other Elemental Kings as one of
their own, Jaul thought that he wouldn’t be against such a thing.

Chapter 61: - Carriage Driver (3)
=================================

**༺ Carriage Driver (3) ༻**

In the southwest of Zelver, an unmoving mass of dark clouds hovered.

The ceaseless flickering of purple lightning brightened the color of the
clouds.

Beneath the clouds was a hellish land, the ground rapidly and
relentlessly lashed by numerous thunderbolts. If observed from a
distance, one could appreciate the streaks of purple lightning
perpetually etched into the sky.

The cloud was a nest born of the Thunderbird’s immense mana.

A long time ago, the Great Witch of Heaven’s Wrath had made her way
through that endless thunderstorm in search of the Thunderbird. She had
then proposed it to become her familiar and traverse the world alongside
her. What an interesting woman, the Thunderbird had thought.

They embarked on a long journey together.

But in the end, the Thunderbird fell victim to a curse from Evil Dragon
Orchis, a black dragon formed of rotting human corpses.

To suppress the extreme destructive impulses inflicted by the curse, the
Thunderbird had engaged in a fierce internal battle that felt as though
his very existence was being shredded.

If it hadn’t been for the constant suppression of the Thunderbird with
an immense amount of lightning mana by his new master, Luce Eltania, he
would not have been able to keep fighting for years.

And while the Thunderbird was able to regain his freedom thanks to
Isaac, his fight… had not yet ended.

“You still can’t remember your fight against Greung. Wasn’t it Isaac?”

Within the Märchen Academy’s top dormitory, Charles Hall, a question had
been repeatedly asked for weeks.

The source of said question, Luce Eltania, asked with a voice as smooth
as moonlight. She was a female student with long, rose-gold hair
cascading down her shoulders.

Luce was sitting in front of a mirror, adorned with a lilac
butterfly-shaped hair ornament. Her silky and elegant hair was well
maintained, and her makeup was impeccable.

It was thanks to the Eltania family’s maid that had been sent to assist
her in the academy.

Her refusal to open her heart to others, not even her maids, had created
clear boundaries in the relationship between the two. Perhaps it could
be said that she was extremely ‘professional’.

Perched on the mirror was a small crow-shaped familiar. It was her
8-star familiar, Thunderbird Galia, who was currently in a compressed
form.

Luce was a level 150 prodigy that possessed an exceptional innate mana
capacity, so Galia was perfectly attuned to her.

After successfully summoning Galia in front of the academy’s staff and
attuning herself to his senses, she was able to shrink Galia without
much trial and error.

\[Ahem…\]

His sweat wasn’t visible to the naked eye due to his black body, but
Galia continued to perspire without pause.

After being liberated from the curse, Galia had reunited with Luce and
shared untold stories about their respective journeys. Laughing
together, they felt a heartwarming emotion deep in their hearts.

Galia’s current dilemma was caused by their conversation, specifically,
the one about Greung.

\[No matter how many times you ask me… I can’t remember.\]

The deep voice of Galia repeated the same answer he had given for weeks.

There was an obvious reason for Isaac to hide his true identity, and he
was his benefactor.

Thus, Galia believed it necessary to prevent any issues from arising.

Even if Luce commanded him, saying, ‘confess everything you know’, Galia
planned to endure the pain that came with disobeying a direct order. It
would hurt like hell, but for the one who had liberated him from that
damned curse, he would endure it.

Still, she had never given Galia a direct order, only making requests or
asking questions. Should he be thankful?

Truthfully, it saddened him that Luce was suffering because of the
Greung incident, as she was quite a precious existence to him.

\[What will you do if Isaac and Greung are one and the same?\]

Galia asked her the question he had been harboring within himself.

“…”

Luce lowered her aquamarine eyes.

Her cheeks flushed while the corners of her lips trembled slightly. It
was a stark contrast to her usual poker face.

“I’m always ready to confess. No matter how I think about it, I can only
see Isaac as Greung… so I hope there will be convincing evidence soon.”

Luce’s feelings for Isaac were wavering between friendship and love.

She was almost certain that he was Greung, but because it hadn’t been
fully proven, she forcibly suppressed the emotions welling within her.

***What is friendship?***

Her current emotions were so tangled and complex that she couldn’t even
give a proper response to that question, leaving her immensely troubled.

Galia wanted to support his master’s love, and to happily watch Luce
date the man she liked.

He felt like all of the emotional restraints binding her would unravel
if he simply said ‘Isaac is Greung’.

However, the sense of duty to his benefactor was like a shackle gripping
his ankle, refusing to let go. If Isaac had wanted to reveal his
identity to Luce, he would have done so himself.

\[Hmm…\]

“…You really don’t remember anything, right?”

\[No matter how many times you ask, my answer is the same.\]

Galia’s cold sweat seemed never-ending as he languished in his deep
inner conflict.

The fierce internal battle within pushed him to the brink.

With a somber expression, Luce let out a quiet sigh.

\[Are you going to see Isaac?\]

“He’s been busy with his work lately, so now isn’t a good time… I might
be able to meet him at the training grounds in the evening, though.”

\[…\]

“…Should I go see him now?”

\[Didn’t you just say that now wasn’t a good time?\]

“What else am I supposed to do? I can’t take it anymore, I…”

As the holidays approached, Luce was glad that she could spend more time
with Isaac, but due to his work, their time together had noticeably
diminished.

She had managed to hold on until now, but her patience was at its
limits.

“I’ve already had a taste of being his friend. So I can’t turn back
now…”

Her manner of speaking was rather depraved, but the wholesome nature of
her statement made Galia feel all the more uncomfortable.

\* \* \*

The Lightning Sovereign, that damned dine and dasher, returned home
after discussing investment with Principal Elena at the Bartos Hall.

I still wondered why he came in person, but because it wasn’t to provide
aid to the demons or hinder me, I decided not to complicate things by
overthinking it.

If something unexpected occurred in the future, I would withhold
judgment and use this incident as a puzzle piece to deduce the cause.

On a side note, I felt more relief than anger when the Lightning
Sovereign left my carriage.

From the start, he had come to find me because I had used
\[Clairvoyance\], so if the payment he had skimped on was in exchange
for my life, it felt like I had benefited.

***…Am I just being a pushover?***

Regardless, I was glad that everything went smoothly… If he had just
flicked his finger, I would’ve been on my way to the afterlife.

“…?”

Today, I was once again working as a carriage driver.

While passing through a stone road, I noticed a girl by the roadside
extending her arm towards me as if she was hitchhiking.

Was it to conceal her identity? She was covering her hair with the hood
of her robe and perception-distorting glasses to obscure her face, but I
could clearly tell that it was Luce.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 150

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to be with you.\]

It didn’t take me long to guess why she hid her identity.

She knew that I was currently working as a carriage driver, as I had
told her when we were chatting the other day.

So on this occasion, she had wanted to spend more time with me by
becoming my customer.

However, she might have been worried that I would be burdened if she
used the carriage and paid me, choosing to hide her identity instead.

‘How admirable.’

It was difficult for me to ignore her feelings, so I decided that I
should give her a ride.

Naturally, I would still take payment. Maybe I would give her a 10%
friend discount.

Parking the carriage, I invited Luce inside. Hearing my greeting, she
silently nodded.

“Where to?”

“Anywhere… I can get an ocean view.”

I tried my best to work with her, but I wished she would have come up
with a more concrete plan, and not be so vague about her destination.

“Um, customer. You need to be more specific about which ocean you would
like to see…”

“Just anywhere I can see the ocean.”

“…Then we’ll head to the Castri coast.”

As she only repeated her previous answer, I responded with a location I
vaguely remembered and started driving the carriage.

Luce snuck a glance at me.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Thrilled that she has successfully
hidden her identity from you.\]

Due to her perception-distorting glasses, her face was blurred. However,
I could still catch glimpses of her mouth twitching.

Soon after, water mana condensed in the air.

\[My master! You’ve completely succeeded in fooling Isaac!\]

Bello, the little orca, cried out in joy.

But was immediately unsummoned.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Currently feeling despair for failing
to hide her identity.\]

…I should have pretended that I didn’t hear that.

Bello’s appearance was far too obvious to continue acting unaware. As if
I had only just realized her identity, I quietly called out her name.

“Luce?”

“…Ugh.”

With a slight whimper, she took off her perception-distorting glasses
and pulled down her hood.

I could see Luce’s rose gold-hair gracefully cascading down her
shoulders. Bowing her head, she covered her face with her hands, exuding
an air of despondence.

……

“We’ve arrived\~”

We were heading to the Akins sea.

It was at the Castri coast where Luce had summoned Galia in front of the
academy staff. The grains of sand and golden sea were shimmering
beautifully from the setting sun.

In an attempt to cheer her up, I told her all sorts of stories.

Fortunately, she was happy just being with me, as she quickly perked up
and became cheerful. We had fun talking together.

Along the way, Bello, her small orca familiar, reappeared and joined the
conversation. As Eden continued responding with ‘Kyuu’, the cute
familiars added to the pleasant atmosphere while I drove the carriage.

My entire body felt stiff after operating the carriage with mana all
day, so I decided to rest at the shore for a while.

We had come at a good time, the setting sun was casting vermilion rays
across the earth.

Luce and I, accompanied by our familiars, slowly walked along the sandy
beach as we enjoyed the sea breeze.

The familiars were giggling as they played together. Somehow, it had
turned into a wrestling match, and the stronger Bello was dominating
Eden.

***Try winning for a change, Eden*.**

Luce’s fluttering rose-gold hair gleamed with the colors of sunset. As
the sea breeze swept past, she tucked her hair behind her ears while
gazing at the setting sun.

Then, she snuck a glance at me before turning away, lowering her head
and smiling softly.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Extremely happy to be at the beach
with you.\]

A fatherly smile naturally spread across my face.

Would I feel like this if my daughter said, ‘I’m so happy to be at the
beach with Dad!’? Of course, I didn’t have a daughter, so I couldn’t be
sure.

“I’m happy. I can be with Isaac without worrying about other people.”

Her ticklish whisper cut through the sea breeze, stimulating my ears.

“Do you like it that much?”

Luce smiled brightly as she nodded.

We continued talking about trivial things, like how cute we found the
spotted cat wandering the academy grounds, or how the quality of the
school food decreased during the vacation.

Sitting side by side on the sandy beach, we quietly gazed at the setting
sun as it slowly fell below the horizon.

“Isaac, you might feel cold. Take this…”

As Luce attempted to take off the robe she was wearing to cover me, I
quickly stopped her by waving my hands.

It may have been summer, but it was already evening, the surroundings
growing chilly from the sea breeze. She would suffer from the cold if
she took off her robe.

I pulled out two blankets from my magic pouch that resembled Doraemon’s
4D pocket as if it were a matter of course. They were items I had
brought when exploring the underground Tantak Cave.

I draped one of the blankets over Luce’s shoulders.

“Hehe.”

She wrapped herself in the blanket without hesitation, smiling. Somehow,
her smile seemed to have become more natural as time went on. It felt
like my second favorite character was growing. The thought alone made me
very happy.

We saw the last rays of the setting sun as it disappeared over the
horizon.

The blankets covering our bodies provided just the right amount of
warmth amidst the chilly sea breeze, creating a cozy atmosphere.

“Isaac.”

“Hmm?”

“You know, I always thought people were like hedgehogs.”

Luce began sharing her emotions with a calm voice.

“The closer I got to someone, the more it felt like I was being pricked
by thorns. I hated everyone. But the closer I get to you, the better I
feel.”

Each word she spoke lingered in my ears.

“Even now, I’m really happy. That’s how I feel.”

Her gentle whisper tickled my eardrums like cotton.

With the arrival of the summer holidays, I had begun spending more time
with her. Perhaps that was why she seemed so excited lately.

Using \[Psychological Insight\], it seemed that Luce only felt happiness
or joy when she was with me. It often made me, the other party, feel a
lot better. This time was no exception.

However, she still maintained a cold attitude towards other people.
Whenever that happened, I would be scared speechless.

“I’m glad.”

I responded with a smile, as I was also happy.

Silently, we immersed ourselves in the afterglow of the setting sun.

I glanced over at Luce, who was deep in thought.

By reading her thoughts, I realized she was experiencing sadness, likely
due to recalling her childhood.

According to ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, after she lost the Great Witch
of Heaven’s Wrath and Hansel, Luce would climb on the roof of the
Eltania family’s manor to watch the sunset almost every day.

I couldn’t even imagine the heaviness of her thoughts in those moments.

Following her loss, I was likely the only person Luce, who was always
alone, had opened her heart to.

After thinking that far, I realized the significance of watching the
sunset alongside Luce.

She was no longer alone. Although I had initially regretted becoming her
friend, I still felt nothing but deep affection for her. I didn’t want
her to be lonely.

So, I was very happy to be by her side now.

Luce, perhaps noticing my gaze, turned to stare at me, before laughing
to the point of blushing.

I followed suit.

The sounds of Bello and Eden’s cries.

The sound of the sea breeze, and the sound of crashing waves.

I thought it was a pretty romantic way to spend a midsummer day.

“Hey.”

Afterwards, Luce, seemingly recalling something, pulled out a small
bundle and held it out to me.

I could hear a jingle, clearly signifying that it contained a lot of
gel.

She had an embarrassed expression.

“Including my ride…there’s a lot of additional gel. So can I monopolize
your carriage for the time being?”

“…?”

Feeling a strong discomfort, I looked between Luce and the bundle.

***Is this…?***

“No?

“It’s fine. Just give me what you owe me. Since you’re my friend, I’ll
give you 10% off, but make sure you calculate properly.”

“Huh?”

Luce appeared flustered when I declined.

Even though she was paying me for a different reason, I couldn’t
conscientiously accept a friendship fee.

Chapter 62: - Carriage Driver - Interlude
=========================================

**༺ Carriage Driver – Interlude ༻**

\[Combat Skills\] **Elemental Series 1: Ice**

– Elemental Firepower (B)

– Elemental Efficiency (B)

– Elemental Synergy (B-)

**Elemental Series 2 (Locked)**

I wasn’t Ian Fairytale. That was something I had come to terms with
recently.

Initially, I had tried to make plans based on my memories of playing
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

But as I grew more accustomed to being Isaac and following the flow of
various scenarios, my mind gradually changed. The Trial of Frost was
particularly decisive for my motivation.

‘I need to be both selective and focused.’

I found myself in a position where I couldn’t copy the strategies of Ian
Fairytale.

To give an example, I didn’t have Ian’s talent in weapons. Ian had been
honing his skills since childhood, allowing him to proficiently wield
the various ultimate weapons of each element.

But as Isaac, I was inherently weak. The only thing I could really do
was focus on magic and physical training, but even that was overwhelming
me.

Realistically, I wouldn’t have enough time to become sufficiently
proficient before the Evil God’s resurrection.

Therefore, I needed to specialize my talents in magic.

Additionally, I needed to allocate more effort towards strengthening my
familiars to compensate for my lack of physical prowess.

In any case, I needed to come up with a plan that suited ‘Isaac’.

‘Can I do it today?’

In the lower-ranked dorm of Doris Hall, the morning sun was radiating
through the window.

Seated on the bed, I extended my left arm in front of me.

It was the same daily routine I undertook to summon Hilde, only to fail
everytime.

However, now that my \[Elemental Efficiency\] had improved from B- to B,
I felt a glimmer of hope that I could succeed.

I began my attempt, imagining the 8-star familiar Frost Dragon Hilde in
a compressed form.

*Hwaaaaa─*

Hilde’s summoning circle reappeared on my left wrist, emitting a pale
blue light.

As usual, that barrier-like obstruction was preventing Hilde from
materializing.

I just needed a small opening. If I could create even the tiniest crack
in the wall, I believed I would be able to somehow pull her out.

‘Please work…!’

I imagined myself hitting the barrier with a hammer, pouring all my
focus into creating a small opening for Hilde to slip through and emerge
from.

And finally…

I felt like something was escaping, like a small hole in the concrete
wall releasing air.

At that moment, I had a hunch that I had succeeded in summoning Hilde.

*Woong─*

From the summoning circle, a faint bluish orb emerged. It resembled a
glowing firefly.

I soon realized that this was Hilde.

\[Frost Dragon Hilde\] **Lv:** (1)

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Element:** Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Relieved to finally be able to converse with you.\]

***I have finally, finally done it…!***

I held up the orb with both hands, supporting Hilde. The spherical light
was so weightless it reminded me of a dandelion seed.

“Can you hear me, Hilde?”

\[…I hear you.\]

Hilde’s elegant voice rang through my head. It resembled the voice of a
female in her late teens or early twenties.

\[May I ask why you have called me?\]

Hilde’s questions had many different implications.

I took a deep breath to calm myself.

I had to convey what I wanted to say to Hilde, even if my words dealt a
psychological blow to her.

“Before that, I have to tell you something.”

Reaffirming my resolve, I spoke to Hilde with a serious expression.

“I’m not who you think I am.”

\[…?\]

“You called me the Ice Sovereign. I’m just someone who is only strong
against demons.”

There was no point in speaking to Hilde about the system since she
wouldn’t understand.

As a result, I decided to just explain my abnormalities as a result of
my \[Hunter\] trait.

“I’m sorry if I disappointed you. I’m not the person you want.”

There was no such thing as the reincarnation of the Ice Sovereign. I was
just Isaac, a weak and normal individual.

Hilde remained still, silently thinking. I couldn’t see her facial
expression due to her being an orb of light, but it was clear that she
was deep in thought over my words.

I silently waited for her to speak.

\[…You are the Ice Sovereign. That I am sure of.\]

Soon after, Hilde firmly refuted my statement in a confident voice.

\[You are a being who possesses the soul of the Ice Sovereign.
Obviously, you are not the same Ice Sovereign of 1000 years ago. One
cannot treat a reincarnated individual as being identical to their
previous life.\]

Hilde continued speaking in a clear, unwavering tone, fully convinced of
my identity.

\[No matter how many times you try to deny it, I can tell. Do not
underestimate my eyes.\]

“…I’m really not.”

\[You are.\]

“I’m not.”

\[You are.\]

“I’m really not.”

\[You are…\]

“I’m no-”

\[Holy fuck. If I say you’re the Ice Sovereign, you are. Just shut up
and listen.\]

“…!”

I was taken aback by the sudden shift in her tone, reminiscent of a
nagging grandmother.

***Ah, fuck. I said it’s not me.***

\[Also, does thou not know my name?\]

“T-That’s…”

I recalled the moment when I had called out to Hilde in the midst of the
Trial of Frost.

At the time, I was struggling to adapt to the Frostscythe’s chill which
led to me making an irrational decision.

***Where should I even begin to explain…? How bothersome.***

While I was pondering my response, Hilde swiftly moved on to a different
question.

\[…That is enough. I have never heard of a trait that only strengthens
one against demons. Are you normally this weak?\]

“I am, but I wouldn’t call myself weak-”

\[In short, you are asking me to see you as your present self rather
than the Ice Sovereign of a thousand years ago, correct?

Cutting me off, Hilde summarized the conversation.

It seemed that Hilde was determined to see me as the Ice Sovereign’s
reincarnation no matter what I said.

\[I had that intention from the very beginning. Clearly, you are no
longer the same as back then.\]

Hilde continued on.

\[Even if you were indeed not the Ice Sovereign in a previous life, I
have assessed your worth and accepted you as my master of my own free
will. Therefore, I hope you do not have any useless concerns.\]

“…Is that so?”

I had come prepared to terminate my contract with Hilde, but it seemed
she had no intention of doing something like that from the start.

For some reason, I felt a bit deflated.

Whilst pondering on what more to say, I eventually settled on a nod.
Since it came to this, I would speak to Hilde as ‘Isaac’.

I was happy with this outcome.

“My name is Isaac. Thank you for forming a contract with me.”

\[I as we- ahem. I would not mind you stroking me to your heart’s
content in the future if you are so grateful.\]

It seemed that Hilde, as a magic beast, yearned for the touch of her
master.

When I could properly summon her, I would pet her until she got sick of
it.

……

After making enough to pay my tuition, I quit my job as a carriage
driver. I also calculated a plan for my future expenses before I focused
on training.

In the gym, I stripped off my shirt and lifted weights with the rest of
the Knight Department who had remained over summer holiday.

At the training grounds, I practiced my magic using various elemental
contraptions and improved my combat capabilities by fighting against
illusionary beasts.

At the end of each exhausting day, I would return to my dorm and take a
refreshing shower before sitting at my desk and reading.

Following an extensive study session, I would sleep like a rock.

As I went about my routine, time flew by, and students gradually began
returning to the academy.

Four days before the end of summer vacation, an announcement I had been
eagerly anticipating appeared at Orphin Hall’s community board.

\[Assignment of Dormitories for 1st years, 2nd semester: Magic
Department\]\]

.

.

.

\[Isaac – Briggs Hall\]

.

.

.

I had been upgraded to Briggs Hall, which was considered one of four
upper-level dorm at Märchen Academy. This was based off my grades during
the first semester.

Finally, I would be escaping the cramped quarters of Doris Hall!

“Yes!”

Filled with happiness, I triumphantly clenched my fist. Some students
walking through the hallway stared at me strangely, but I didn’t care. I
walked away from Orphin Hall with light steps.

Upon reaching Doris Hall, I began gathering my belongings. Considering
the room reminded me of a one-room apartment in Seoul… it was definitely
a bit cramped.

Regardless, it felt a bit empty.

“…”

This was my home from the day I had first transmigrated into ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

Feeling a rush of emotion, I bid Doris Hall farewell.

***Be well.***

I then headed to Briggs Hall, my new dorm. The building itself was
significantly larger and more spacious in comparison.

I check the notice on the community board and went to go find my room.

The room was about twenty square meters in size, and there was even a
refrigerator powered by an ice spell.

It felt so awesome I quickly forgot about the nostalgia associated with
Doris Hall.

“Eden, put this over there.”

\[Kyuu!\]

After stacking my belongings in a pile, I began organizing them
individually with Eden.

\[I apologize for being unable to help.\]

“It’s not like you can do anything.”

Hilde was currently floating in the form of a small, glowing blue orb.
The reason she didn’t have a physical form was entirely my fault, so why
was she the one apologizing?

After successfully unpacking and organizing my belongings, I wiped the
sweat from my forehead.

Despite not having the ability to sweat, Eden mimicked my actions. I
didn’t know why he did it, but it was cute, so I paid no mind.

……

The shaded walkway was refreshing to traverse, but the humid summer air
was repulsive.

However, as the second semester’s first exams began, summer would turn
to fall.

As summer vacation came to an end, the returning students filled the
academy’s streets with liveliness.

The sky was crystal clear without a single cloud in sight. At the
academy’s main square, the opening ceremony for the Magic Department was
underway.

There were currently about 290 students in their first year within the
Magic Department, 10 fewer than the previous semester. I could tell from
the dorm assignment notice.

They probably failed, or perhaps dropped out willingly out of fear for
their well-being, considering what had occurred during the previous
semester.

A little while after the opening ceremony had completed, I heard a
voice.

“Move to your provisional classrooms.”

Fernando Frost, a male professor I hadn’t seen in a while, was giving
instructions to the students.

Now that the second-semester had begun, they would conduct a new
assessment in order to remeasure the mana of the students in order to
place them in an appropriate class.

I moved to the provisional class 2 of Orphin Hall, where students were
already taking their seats.

The only people I recognized were Amy Holloway and Ciel Carnedas. I
waved hello to Amy, and gazed briefly at Ciel.

Ciel was still clutching the pillow I had given to her during our
end-of-semester evaluation. She seemed to really like it.

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Psychology:** \[Fond of you and wary of you.\]

“…?”

***What are these conflicting emotions?***

Could it be because of something that occurred during our
end-of-semester evaluation? For now, it seemed better to refrain from
approaching Ciel. When I saw her, I could only remember being pushed
around here and there.

I took a seat somewhere in the middle of the pack. Soon after, Professor
Fernando entered the lecture hall. By now, Ian must have met the
provisional professor of Class 4, Philip Meltron.

Professor Fernando paused in front of the podium and began his speech.

“I’m sure you all expected this.”

“…”

“Similar to the previous semester, we will now evaluate your mana, the
purpose being identical to last semester. After four days, we will
reorganize the classes based on your level of ability. Use this
opportunity to demonstrate your growth from your first semester and
summer vacation.”

As usual, Professor Fernando spoke in a straightforward manner.

In response, each of the students formed a wide range of expressions.

“Let’s go to the training grounds.”

Just like during the first mana evaluation, every first-year student of
the Magic Department moved to the training grounds.

Professor Fernando’s assistants began handing out mana meters that
resembled grip strengtheners to the first-year students, who were
standing in an orderly queue.

Marco, who was one of the professor’s assistants, gave me a mana meter
with a lifeless expression. Imagining just how little sleep he must have
gotten over summer vacation made me pity him.

“Those with the five lowest numbers in each class, step forth.”

With Professor Fernando’s command, the mana evaluation began.

Naturally, the same individuals as last semester stood out.

“Ha! Will you be able to handle the dense, thick, limitless mana within
this body?”

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 80

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to showcase his strength.\]

Tristan Humphrey, Grade B mana.

\[Mateo Jordana\] **Lv:** 83

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Feels that he has gotten slightly stronger.\]

Mateo Jordana, Grade B mana.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 99

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Pleased at the results of her extensive training over
summer vacation.\]

Kaya Astrean, Grade A- mana.

\[Ciel Carnedas\] **Lv:** 95

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Water

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to sleep as soon as possible.\]

Ciel Carnedas, Grade B+ mana.

\[Ian Fairytale\] **Lv:** 64

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Light, Fire

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Proud to have gotten slightly stronger.\]

Ian Fairytale, Grade C mana.

“…”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 151

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to be with you all day.\]

As the results of Luce’s mana evaluation appeared, Professor Fernando
appeared astonished.

It was natural. Luce had already far surpassed all of the other
first-year students by a wide margin.

“Luce Eltania… ***Your mana is immeasurable.*** You are at least Grade S
or higher. We’ll use a more precise mana meter in the future.”

The students were shocked at Professor Frost’s words, but Luce remained
as emotionless as ever. It was fascinating to see her so lost in her own
thoughts despite the turmoil around her.

One’s mana being immeasurable meant they were at least S rank.

Luce, who had already amazed the students with her Grade A+ during the
previous semester, had made a tremendous leap to Grade S in just one
semester. For the other students, who weren’t aware of her
circumstances, it was quite a shocking development.

When measuring mana, there were additional grades from S rank onwards.
This included S-, S, S+, SS… and so on, until SSS+ rank. Luce was now
somewhere within that range.

For reference, Dorothy Heartnova was SSS- rank, Alice Carroll was SS+
rank, the Lightning Sovereign, Jaul Dragoniac was about SSS+ rank.
However, they were still only listed as S rank in the status window.

Furthermore, when one’s level reached 200, they were eligible to reach
EX rank, allowing them to surpass their own limits.

For all these reasons, I was able to achieve level 200 and EX grade
stats in \[Fictional Hell\], obtaining the 9-star passive skill \[Ice
Sovereign\].

“Next.”

It was now my turn.

Getting into a line with the other students, I held out the mana meter
in front of me.

“Begin!”

With Professor Fernando’s order, I began channeling mana into the
device.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 68

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman Who Has Adapted To Student Life

**Mana:** 5200/5200

– Mana Recovery Speed (C+)

Thanks to my increased stamina from \[Physical Training Efficiency\], I
was able to push myself to train harder over the summer. As a result, my
leveling speed increased substantially, and I managed to reached level
68.

I felt that controlling my mana was far easier than during my first
semester. Although there were slight mana leaks, this much was
acceptable.

With a beeping noise, the mana evaluation concluded. Professor Fernando
grabbed the mana meters with his telekinesis magic and began reading
them out one by one.

“Number 26, C-. Number 27, C. Number 28, C. Number 29, C-. Number 30…
C+.”

When Professor Fernando called my number, he hesitated briefly,
signifying his surprise.

It was natural. He wouldn’t have forgotten my Grade E classification
during the previous semester.

But now, my grade was C+.

Memories of the past semester flashed through my mind.

Within the department, I was known for being the lowest of the low. I
had Grade E mana, and was a commoner in Class D. I was at the bottom of
the ladder in both magic and social status.

The cruel students of Märchen Academy had treated me like leftover meat
scraps.

“Is it possible to go from Grade E… to Grade C+ in one semester?”

“Don’t you think there’s a mistake…? Like maybe the mana meter is
faulty. I mean, Ian is special, but Isaac is just a normal kid.”

“Don’t you remember when he used a 5-star spell during the first
semester? He probably put in a ridiculous amount of effort. He looks
different too.”

“Still, he had Grade E Mana and was in Class D…”

Perhaps because I had gone through such rapid growth, surpassing my
previous image as an underachieving student with Grade E mana, the way
the other students looked at me was beginning to change.

Chapter 63: - Second Element
============================

**༺ Second Element ༻**

1\. Observe Isaac from a distance. You do not have to be reckless in your
observation, but if you notice something unusual, report it to me
immediately.

2\. Never use \[Sight Synchronization\] on Isaac unless you want to
become blind.

3\. Never mention anything regarding Isaac’s affairs. He is not someone
we can touch.

***It was terrifying.***

Aichel’s solemn warning lodged into Keridna’s mind like a wedge, the
memory gripping her with a sense of unease.

‘Who in the world is that man?’

A female student with short pink hair was sitting in Provisional Class
3, this student was Keridna Whiteclark.

She was currently lost in thought, sitting with her chin resting on her
hand as she quietly tapped the desk with her fingers.

While the professor was conducting the orientation on the second
semester’s curriculum at the podium, Keridna couldn’t bring herself to
focus on the information.

Isaac had been the weakest in the Magic Department, possessing Grade E
mana.

The symbol of the Whiteclark Ducal family was the White Dragon, a
mythological magic beast.

The image of Isaac forming a contract with that magic beast wouldn’t
leave her mind.

Where should she even begin to be astonished? From the fact that the
mythical White Dragon was still alive? Or from when Isaac had formed a
voluntary master-familiar contract with said creature? Regardless, it
was quite a ridiculous tale.

‘Of course, I don’t think he’s still the weakest in the department
anymore.’

Going into the second semester, Isaac had grown rapidly, increasing his
mana capacity to C+. While he was still much weaker than her…

It was still disorienting.

***What the hell is Isaac’s true identity?***

As Keridna continued to ponder it, she vividly recalled blood flowing
down Aichel’s face, it still gave her chills.

If Aichel hadn’t plundered her \[Sight Synchronization\], Keridna
would’ve been blinded. The cost of daring to spy on a monster like Isaac
had been paid by her sister.

Thankfully, Aichel always had an absurd amount of \[Basic Protection
Magic\] active. Otherwise, she really would have gone blind.

Keridna had incurred a debt that would be impossible to repay in her
lifetime.

*“Ugh…”*

Keridna had no idea just how terrifying the secret she had tried to
uncover was.

However, she knew one thing for certain.

Isaac was… like the embodiment of fear—a monster dwelling in the dark
depths of the ocean.

There were some truths in this world that were better off unknown, and
Isaac’s secret might have been among them.

Keridna had almost gone blind as a consequence of her curiosity.

Now, Isaac was the object of her fear.

\* \* \*

\[Congratulations! You have unlocked the second elemental slot!\] \[Your
second element is \[Rock\].\]

While leveling up from 63 to 68, I invested my stat points into \[Magic
Training Efficiency\].

Thanks to that, a combined 81 stat points were allocated to \[Magic
Training Efficiency\], and it was now at A+.

I had also met with Kaya Astrean, who constantly blushed and attempted
to avoid my gaze. By reading psychology, I discovered that Kaya was
avoiding me because she was embarrassed about kissing me on the cheek
during summer vacation.

I approached Kaya to say hello, but it seemed clear she wasn’t willing
to converse with me. She merely continually pleaded with me to ‘forget
her mistake during the vacation ceremony’.

At the sight of her desperate state, I could only respond in agreement.
Soon after, Kaya abruptly left.

It seemed clear the distance between us would remain for the time being.

Recently, our new class placements had been determined. Since there were
no demons during the class placement evaluations, I just had to do my
best.

As a result of those evaluations, I was placed in the upper level of
Class C. It was hard for anyone to believe.

The vast majority of students remained in the same class as last
semester, including the Class D students.

Every time we passed by in the hallways, they glared at me. By reading
their psychology, I could see they felt a sense of inferiority towards
me.

‘Ha.’

***Look at how they’re treating me now compared to last semester.***

Considering I was someone they had believed themselves to be superior
to, it was quite a significant development to say the least.

Thus,「Act 4, Chapter 1, Beginning of Second Semester」 of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱ passed without any major incidents.

It was now evening. After completing all my classes, I headed towards
the corner of the Butterfly Garden. It was where I spent most of my time
during the first semester, so whenever anything new happened, I was
inclined to think about it there.

Unlike the first semester, where I focused on delving deeply into a
singular element, the second semester’s curriculum would force me to
simultaneously train a second element.

For my own personal growth, a structured magical education was
important, so it was beneficial for me to follow the curriculum.

Right on cue, I had successfully unlocked a second element, accompanied
by a system notification.

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」

“Hmm.”

As I channeled mana through my right hand, small fragments of stone
manifested and began floating gently, seemingly in a state of
weightlessness.

I had hoped for a gas or liquid element like fire, water, lightning, or
wind, but like my ice element, I had received another solid element.

Consequently, there were clear drawbacks in terms of mobility and
utility.

‘Still, there are clear advantages as well.’

I could name at least three immediate advantages off the top of my head
that came with my new element.

The first was compatibility. Rock magic could counter the greatest
weakness of ice magic, which was fire. Still, water would’ve been
better.

The second was the coolness factor. If I crossed my arms while summoning
boulders from the sky, along with a cool one-liner like ‘When heaven
moves, everything follows’, my coolness factor would be immeasurable.

The third was my familiar, Eden.

I summoned Eden, light brown mana gathered in the air and took the form
of a small golem familiar.

Eden landed softly on the ground.

\[Kyuu! Kyuu?\]

My familiar Eden was of the rock element. In other words, I could now
begin to supply him with my own rock mana.

As I channeled some rock mana towards Eden, he began to jump up and down
in surprise.

“Eden, does my mana taste good?”

\[Yeah!\]

Eden responded, accompanied by a happy pose.

What a cute fellow.

I petted Eden’s head with a smile.

Providing a large amount of mana to a familiar would accelerate its
growth, allowing the summon to keep up with the growth of its master.

The next time I activated \[Hunter\] and summoned Eden, the surge in
mana would be like a temporary buff, strengthening Eden greatly.

If he were able to stabilize his buffed state, Eden would likely grow at
an astonishing speed.

***Hehe.***

The next demon I would face was an elephant demon from 「Act 4, Chapter
3, Underground Giant」 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, known as “Elphelt
the Evanescent”.

To reach him, I had to clear a considerably difficult mission from 「Act
4, Chapter 2, Food Chain」, so I expected one hell of a challenge in the
future.

But more than that, I was worried about something. Or more specifically,
someone.

‘Kaya.’

The hidden boss of 「Act 4 Chapter 3: Underground Giant」 was ‘Kaya
Astrean’.

Yes, it was our very own Kaya Astrean. Although it would only be
temporary, Kaya would become a demon, and the fight between us was
unavoidable.

In the forums, the corrupted Kaya was referred to as ‘Dark Kaya’ for
simplicity. Because of her difficulty, I saw many posts mocking
nonexistent parents, saying things like ‘Did someone’s mother die for
this level of difficulty?’. Her patterns were so irregular it was
difficult to find a method that worked.

Not only was Kaya much stronger now than in the original scenario, but
her tactical awareness had also increased.

Ignoring the co-op EXP she had received in the Tantak Underground Cave,
the fact that I had also given her the Armana Wand as a gift was the
true difference maker.

While giving that gift to Kaya had saved me during the first semester,
it would become a blade that aimed for my neck during the second
semester.

In other words, Dark Kaya’s patterns would be entirely different from
the ones I knew, making this fight uncharted territory.

‘Well, I’ll still win though.’

The reason I had given her the Armana Wand was simple.

No matter how much her attack patterns changed, I would be much stronger
than her when \[Hunter\] was active.

Just by levels alone, mine would be substantially higher than Dark
Kaya’s.

It was important to note the fact that the lower one’s level was in
comparison to their opponent, the less damage they could inflict, but
even then…

I had the Frostscythe and Hilde with me now, so there was no way I could
lose.

While I was lost in thought, I heard a familiar voice.

“Presideeeeent\~”

“Ah!”

A voice rang in my ears, startling me, and forcing me to cover my ears
and step away.

***Wow, I thought my eardrums were about to burst.***

Turning my head in the direction of the noise, I saw a female student
with lavender hair wearing a distinctive witch’s hat.

“Nyahaha! You’re so cute!”

It was Dorothy, who was laughing mischievously.

“Ah… Senior, you’re here.”

The lingering sensation from Dorothy’s whisper and breath remained from
her playful antics, leaving me unable to remove my hands from my ears.

“So you’ve awakened a second element, right?”

“Yes. It was the rock element.”

“Our President has been hitting the gym and putting on some muscle, so
rock does kind of suit you.”

“What kind of logic is that…?”

Tilting her head, Dorothy giggled mischievously.

“It’s been a while since you’ve last been here. Lately, you’ve only been
going to the gym and back.”

“I wanted to organize my thoughts. I’ve just unlocked a new element, and
I need to think about how to best train and develop it for the future.”

“Hm, since you’ve just unlocked it, you probably can’t use very many
spells, right?”

“That’s right, I can only cast basic spells, so I was thinking about
mastering those.”

My \[Magic Training Efficiency\] and \[Learning Efficiency\] had
drastically improved since last semester, meaning I should be able to
practice more effectively.

“Can this big sis help you?”

Dorothy began to smile slyly.

“Senior? Help me with what?”

“Just tell me yes or no.”

“If you’ll help me, then of course I’ll be grateful.”

“Then extend both of your hands.”

I did as Dorothy instructed and held out my hands.

“…!”

Suddenly, Dorothy placed my hands on top of her wrists and gently
grasped my own.

With our hands and wrist pressed firmly against each other, I could
distinctly feel her soft skin. I was embarrassed, to say the least.

“Grab my wrists.”

***What’s going on…?***

I hesitantly grabbed onto Dorothy’s wrists as instructed.

Her wrists were quite slender.

At that moment, I finally realized that Dorothy, who had always been
like a daughter to me, was a woman after all.

The moment I began to realize this, light brown rock mana began to flow
where our wrist met.

*Sssssssss─*

Beginning from my wrists, I could sense the rock mana circuits that had
been buried throughout my body coming to life.

It was the same sensation I had felt every time I increased my
proficiency with ice magic.

Amazed, I stared at Dorothy in disbelief as she offered me a bright
smile, tilting her head to the side.

Beneath her witch’s hat, her golden earrings gleamed as they reflected
the last vestiges of the sunset. As usual, her eyes seemed to contain
the universe within them.

**My eyes were feasting on her.**

“I have the rock element too, wind and rock to be exact. That’s why I
can use my own rock mana to help you master your own. Well, it’s only
possible because it’s me though\~”

“You’re the best, Senior. Really.”

“Nihihi.”

I couldn’t help but smile, as I hadn’t expected to receive any
assistance. I was lucky to meet Dorothy today.

At this rate, it felt as though I could master various rock spells far
faster than I had anticipated.

Before I even realized, the flow of Dorothy’s rock mana had ceased.

“Since this method only works when you first awaken a new element,
there’s nothing else I can do!”

***This much is already plenty.***

I repeatedly expressed my gratitude to Dorothy, and each time I did, she
responded enthusiastically, placing a hand on her hip and brimming with
confidence.

The warmth of summer gradually faded away, signaling the beginning of
autumn.

The increase in my rock element’s \[Elemental Firepower\] and
\[Elemental Efficiency\] far surpassed my expectations. It was the
result of me applying my A+ \[Magic Training Efficiency\] and Dorothy’s
assistance.

It had only been a short time since I had unlocked it, yet I had already
reached C rank.

For the rock element, \[Elemental Synergy\] was useless, so I didn’t
bother increasing that stat.

Additionally, I learned some new spells.

To begin with, the 4-star spell \[Ice Spear\] was a very useful spell,
boasting mana density that far exceeded anything I could form with \[Ice
Generation\].

I could launch it towards an enemy by willing it to do so, and the magic
circle would do the firing.

Among my former offensive ice spells, I only had \[Frostfire\] which
boasted a large area of effect but lacked offensive firepower, and
\[Frost Explosion\], which was far too powerful to be used normally.
Therefore, I had chosen to learn \[Ice Spear\], which had a limited
range but a concentrated attack power.

I also learned the 3-star rock spell \[Stone Toss\], which threw rocks
that possessed a higher mana density than rocks formed by \[Rock
Generation\].

The higher the mana density, the greater the power and strength of a
spell. This was especially true for spells that formed solid matter.

“Isaac, all clear. You may proceed.”

Currently, I was heading towards an exam site.

Inside the cabin, the exam proctor began scanning my body to ensure I
didn’t have any unusual items on me. Since I hadn’t brought anything
abnormal, I passed the test easily.

In this exam, I was only allowed to bring magic weapons or absolute
necessities.

The Sheath of Disaster was considered a magic tool instead of a magic
weapon, so I had been forced to leave it at my dorm.

If I had to explain the difference between a magic tool and a magic
weapon, it would be that magic weapons enhanced the power of its user in
exchange for making mana manipulation more difficult.

Some examples of that would include Kaya’s Armana Wand, or Lisetta’s
Rock Bat.

Magic tools, on the other hand, referred to tools with magic applied to
them. The Sheath of Disaster was treated as a magic tool since it used
the spell stored within it like a magic scroll would.

After passing the inspection, I left the cabin, and heard the noise of
seagulls in the distance.

It made sense, as I was on a ship owned by the academy.

The sky was a vivid blue.

I enjoyed the cool sea breeze brushing against my skin, and the humid
air filling my lungs.

By looking around, I could see the vast blue sea surrounding me.

If I turned around now, I would be able to catch a glimpse of the frenzy
at the dock.

But by staring straight ahead, I could see a singular island anchored
firmly in my sights, named ‘Elt Island’. It was the location of our next
exam, and it would serve as the main stage for 「Act 4, Chapter 2, Food
Chain」 and 「Act 4, Chapter 3, Underground Giant」.

Several ships were traveling to Elt Island, each one carrying a varying
amount of Magic Department freshmen. They would dock at various prepared
locations and let the students off.

Many students were wandering the deck and chatting. They were completely
unaware of the upcoming exam, leaving them lost.

This next exam was going to be ridiculously challenging.

Leaning against the ship’s railing, I stared out into the sea, noting
the last vestiges of clouds disappearing over the distant horizon.

‘Ugh, I’m so nervous.’

I felt as though I was walking on a very narrow tightrope.

Even though I had managed to come up with a plan, I remained nervous. I
was sure that there were many variables that couldn’t be accounted for.

“…?”

As I was thinking deeply, I felt somebody’s gaze lock onto me, making me
turn my head towards the source.

“Ah.”

On a ship opposite mine, I gazed at a cute, green-haired girl who was
holding onto her ship’s railing. Her twin tails were fluttering in the
sea breeze.

It was Kaya Astrean.

Blushing like a beetroot, Kaya bowed her head.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Her heart is fluttering at the
thought that she made eye contact with you.\]

She had a shy expression on her face, accompanied by a faint smile. It
felt like a scene from a teenage romance movie.

As always, she was an incredibly lovely child.

I had known for a while that Kaya had feelings for me. Unfortunately,
the luxury that was a romantic relationship was out of the question
until we defeated the Evil God.

“…”

I would have to fight Kaya in the future.

Of course, I would save that child.

Now wasn’t the time to think about such childish things.

Steeling my resolve, I was determined to overcome the 4th scenario no
matter how fucked up the difficulty may be.

Just like I had done up until now.

<span id="0063_64_-_Hunting_Evaluation_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 64: - Hunting Evaluation (1)
====================================

**༺ Hunting Evaluation (1) ༻**

Opportunities for education must be guaranteed.

That was why, despite the many appearances of demons this year, Märchen
Academy refused to give up on educating its students. It was safer and
more in line with their survival of the fittest ideology in teaching
students.

This was in spite of the situation requiring the intervention of the
Imperial Knights at the academy.

That desire was the root cause of the academy allocating more of its
budget to hiring additional wizards and knights.

Demons were considered natural disasters.

They lacked intelligence, were solitary, behaved unpredictably, and had
indeterminable origins.

However, the fact that such creatures had made appearances multiple
times at Märchen Academy this year meant there was a special reason for
it. The Imperial family was sure of it.

As a result, certain members of the 4th Imperial Knight Squadron, the
Fenrir Knights, were dispatched to investigate the cause.

They wouldn’t be able to find anything though.

It was only natural that they wouldn’t be able to uncover the identity
of the spy, where the demons came from, or the true identity of the
Black Monster.

Alice had thoroughly prepared in order to not get caught, and demons
were originally microorganisms that lived underground before being given
form by the Evil God’s mana.

Furthermore, there wasn’t an individual with the ice element that
possessed the mana of the Black Monster at the academy, no matter what
they believed.

Because the Imperial Princess planned to enter Märchen Academy the
following year, the Imperial Knights had no choice but to intensify
their search efforts.

Märchen Academy was the pinnacle of all elite institutions on the
continent.

Naturally, this was merely by reputation, but there was an actual reason
for it. The true reason would be slowly revealed during my sophomore
year.

With the deployment of many skilled Imperial Knights, the academy had
full confidence in being able to handle any demon that appeared.

From this year onward, it became evident that Märchen Academy would be
the primary deployment site until the graduation of the Imperial
Princess. This would greatly contribute to the security of the academy.

For that reason, some members of the Imperial Knights would serve as
proctors.

Still, seeing it with my own two eyes was awe-inspiring.

“Now, I will explain the rules of your ‘Hunting Evaluation’.”

Elt Island was a place that resembled the Amazon Rainforest. However,
the colors were far more vibrant in comparison, as there were many
plants filled with a variety of elemental mana.

Each academy ship had stopped at different docks on Elt Island. At one
of the docks, the students disembarked and stood in an orderly fashion
while gazing at the professors in charge.

I was also among them.

Professor Fernando began to explain the rules of the exam. The other
proctors stood in formation, exuding a tremendous amount of authority.

“The exam will conclude by evening, and you will stay on this island
during that time.”

“Your objective is simple. Accumulate as many ‘points’ as possible until
the exam concludes or you are eliminated. Those points will determine
both your grades and the gel you will receive.”

How could one accumulate points?

“Points can be earned by a successful hunt. Here on Elt Island, we have
prepared various demonic illusions and summoned familiars. Each
successful capture will grant you points based on the grade of your
hunt.”

“…”

“As you venture deeper towards the center of Elt Island, your enemies
will continually become stronger, but you also have the potential to
receive that many more points in return. Rest assured, an inspection of
Elt Island confirmed there were no signs of natural demonic creatures.”

With that statement, Professor Fernando confirmed they had also found
‘no trace of demons’.

In this world, there was a clear distinction made between magic beasts
and demonic creatures. Demonic creatures were also known as monsters,
while magic beasts were beings strongly connected to mana.

On the other hand, demonic creatures were an uncompromising, evil
species. However, while similar, the demons were classified separately
as a superior species due to their excessively unique presence.

“If you’re defeated by a demonic illusion, your bracelet will ring,
signaling that you have failed. The proctors will come find you, so stay
where you are.”

All students, including me, had a non-removable bracelet equipped.
Similar to the end-of-semester evaluation from the previous semester, it
could be used to track the locations of the students.

“Points can also be used to purchase items at various shops throughout
Elt Island. However, since these points will also be used to determine
your grade, it will be best if you save them as much as possible. In
other words, this exam will evaluate your combat capabilities, survival
skills, wisdom, and knowledge.”

“Professor! What happens if fellow students were to fight, say, to steal
each other’s items…? Will the students involved be failed?

A boy that looked like a model student raised his hand, asking a
question.

Looking at that student, Professor Fernando responded.

“It’s not a problem.”

“…!”

The other students appeared rather shocked.

“I’ll repeat myself one more time. The ‘hunting evaluation’ will judge
your combat capabilities, survival skills, wisdom, and knowledge. It
will test how you adapt to various opponents, how you seize an
opportunity, and even how efficiently you escape. You can each become
both predator and prey to one another.”

“…”

“If you’re scared of having your belongings stolen, fight back or run
away.”

Professor Fernando spoke in his usual cold tone.

“If you wish to give up midway or undergo circumstances unrelated to the
exam, be sure to report to us using the bracelet, and we will take
appropriate action.”

“It’s currently 10 am. The exam will end at midnight, and the remaining
time will be displayed on your bracelets. Make sure you survive.”

“…”

“That will be all. Enter based on your previously assigned numbers.”

The order of the assigned numbers was based on the first semester’s
class placement evaluations, and following that, the students slowly
began to enter Elt Island’s forest.

I followed suit, immediately taking note of the vibrant jungle that
boasted various colors – frost-covered trees, flowers pulsating with
electricity, and massive oak trees adorned with leaves larger than my
own body.

Moving cautiously yet swiftly, I proceeded deeper into the forest.

When a blue light was emitted from my bracelet, it would signal the
start of the exam.

Knowing this, I hid behind an oak tree and paid close attention to my
wrist.

Soon after, the bracelet began to glow with a fierce red light before
vanishing, giving way to a singular blue light.

The exam had begun.

I had two goals in mind for this exam.

The first was to reach the ‘volcano’ at the center of Elt Island.

The second was to meet ‘Ian Fairytale’.

I was able to deduce that Ian had arrived at the dock opposite mine by
observing the approximate direction in which our respective ships were
heading.

Immediately before the exam began, Ian would meet Kaya, and the pair
would form a team.

According to 「Act 4. Chapter 2. Food Chain」, they would slowly make
their way to the center of the island to earn points.

While it normally would have been difficult to pinpoint Ian and Kaya’s
exact location.

‘I have \[Clairvoyance\].’

I closed my left eye and activated \[Clairvoyance\].

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

As my right eye turned silver, my field of vision shifted at an
astonishing speed.

In an instant, my gaze moved towards the opposite end of Elt Island,
where I saw Ian. Just like the original story, Kaya had met with Ian,
and the two were engaged in a conversation.

Nodding at each other, the two began to head towards the central region
of Elt Island.

I deactivated \[Clairvoyance\], and regained my original field of vision
by reopening my left eye.

If I continued towards the volcano and periodically followed Ian’s
movements with \[Clairvoyance\], I would be able to meet up with them.

‘They’ll be heading straight for the volcano.’

They might pause a few times to hunt and eat, but they would arrive
within 8 hours at the latest.

The demon Elphelt the Evanescent, who appeared in 「Act 4, Chapter 3,
Underground Giant」, would emerge in the volcanic region of Elt island
and devour Kaya.

Kaya would then be forced into its body, and Ian would also be eaten in
order to save her.

‘Ian won’t be able to survive though.’

Elphelt’s body was filled to the brim with demons, almost like
cockroaches. Given Ian’s lack of control over his own body, there was no
possible way for him to survive.

Therefore, the best method was to find Ian before he went inside
Elphelt’s body.

As a side note, I considered leaving an anonymous letter to the academy
that, ‘A demon will appear near the center of Elt Island’.

Naturally, I decided against it as it would create too many variables. I
didn’t know if they would believe me and even if they did, it would be
problematic.

It was likely that the evaluation would be suspended and Elt Island
would be sealed off. If that happened, nobody would be able to stop
Elphelt.

I also couldn’t be certain if things would go as I intended.

Above all, I hoped for there to be zero casualties. It would not only
disrupt the scenario, but it could also lead to a bad ending.

I had carefully thought about how to keep Kaya out of harm’s way, but I
had given up on that idea.

‘There’s no other way.’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 4, Chapter 2, Food Chain」, it had
been explained that a bad ending was guaranteed if Kaya didn’t make it
to the center.

Elphelt was attracted to the plant element, so as soon as it had
awakened, it went after Kaya.

If Kaya reached the central region where the giant’s head was, all
Elphelt would have to do was open its mouth to swallow Kaya whole,
leaving him quite satisfied.

But if Kaya didn’t make it to the volcanic region by the time Elphelt
woke up, fire and ‘blood’ magic would erupt throughout Elt Island,
causing massive casualties. It was a death en masse.

Therefore, finding a way to exclude Kaya from the exam entirely was far
too risky.

Elphelt’s skin was as tough as Galia’s \[Thunder God’s Barrier\],
reaching a strength equivalent to someone who was level 190. It was a
demon designed to be slain solely by entering its body.

Moreover, the only viable passage to enter Elphelt’s body was through
its mouth. If Kaya wasn’t present, there would be no reason for him to
open it.

***Even if I am temporarily sacrificing Kaya…***

***…In order to prevent a bad ending, this is the safest method.***

‘Let’s do it.’

I took a deep breath, calming myself.

***This is just the beginning.***

Firstly, I had to capture several demonic illusions on my way towards
the central region and earn some points. Then, I should go look for an
unmanned shop.

Elt Island was quite vast, so there were quite a few unmanned shops
installed throughout the island.

‘It’s quiet.’

Only the sound of grasshoppers chirping and birds tweeting could be
heard. It was a completely contrasting atmosphere compared to the first
semester’s evaluation.

This was likely due to the fact that the outer area of the island had
very few creatures present.

“Hilde.”

I summoned Frost Dragon Hilde, who appeared in the form of a small orb
of light.

\[Frost Dragon Hilde\] **Lv:** (1)

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Element:** Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Enjoying the new environment.\]

\[Is this the exam site you mentioned?\]

As Hilde’s faint voice rang through my head, I nodded.

“Let me know if there are any people, magic beasts, or demonic creatures
nearby.”

\[Gladly.\]

Using \[Clairvoyance\] required a substantial amount of mana, so I chose
to rely on Hilde for surveillance instead.

Hilde began to survey my surroundings from the air. Being a small orb of
light, she would go unnoticed by any potential enemy as long as she
remained vigilant.

\[There is nothing particularly out of the ordinary.\]

I carefully stepped out from behind the large oak tree and began moving.

As I headed towards the central region of Elt Island, Hilde continued to
report any signs of demonic creatures, magic beasts, or nearby people.

Therefore, I was able to follow a relatively safe path. If the distance
between Hilde and I was too far, her voice became fainter, so we needed
to maintain a certain distance.

\[I found a demonic creature… but it feels rather strange.\]

\[Kiiik?\]

\[Caw?\]

「Stone Toss (Rock Element ★3)」

*Boom!*

When I discovered demonic illusions that resembled ants, I quickly
disposed of them by using rock magic.

The demonic illusions disappeared like ash into the wind. It was because
they were simply apparitions created by a magic tool.

\[W-What..?! Do demonic creatures turn into ash after they die these
days…?\]

Hilde seemed greatly surprised, her tone resembling that of an old
grandmother’s. At the same time, her voice was so beautiful it gave off
a strange sense of alienation.

“They’re just illusory forms of demonic creatures.”

\[I-Is there such a thing…? It seems the world has changed in many ways
while I was gone… It is only natural, I suppose…\]

Hilde seemed to feel the weight of the years that had passed.

The defeated demonic illusions transformed into mana grains and flowed
into my bracelet.

At the same time, the number of points listed on my bracelet increased
to 20. It seemed each of those ant-looking creatures was worth 10
points.

They must have been quite valuable.

I resumed my walk.

\* \* \*

**Elt Island Plateau.**

After Luce summoned Galia in a suitable size, she quickly flew to the
top of a cliff.

There, Luce scanned the entirety of Elt Island, noting the reddish-brown
volcano at its center.

\[My master is currently looking for Isaac again! A beam is coming out
of her eyes! Super beam!!!\]

“…”

*Smack!*

Luce forcefully hit Bello, her small orca familiar who had been
chattering away like a child.

\[Bello is shocked! Violence isn’t allowed! Violence isn’t allowed!\]

“Shut up. I have to find him because he’s my friend.”

Luce meticulously searched between the canopy of the trees, looking for
even the tiniest traces of Isaac.

“I have to protect him.”

With her exceptional eyesight and keen observation skills, she was
confident in finding anything related to Isaac.

However, the dense forest made her search for Isaac considerably more
difficult.

“Isaac, where are you…?”

She wanted to hurry and find him as soon as possible.

Elt Island was so secluded that she could spend the entire day with
Isaac without anyone seeing them.

***Ah… how wonderful would that be?***

Luce began to salivate.

Chapter 65: - Hunting Evaluation (2)
====================================

**༺ Hunting Evaluation (2) ༻**

Elt Island was teeming with mushrooms that caused various abnormalities.

The Po’i mushroom spewed poisonous spores upon feeling threatened.

The Kulkul mushroom, which forcefully induced sleep.

The Soli mushroom, which upon receiving a heavy blow, released spores
that healed any abnormalities caused by other spores.

The Xerom mushroom temporarily disrupted one’s mana circuit, preventing
the use of magic.

For the record, the Xerom mushroom didn’t affect strong individuals such
as Luce. I, on the other hand, was still vulnerable to its effects.

In any case, there was a need to be wary of all kinds of mushrooms. If I
fell into an abnormal state, it would significantly hinder my progress
towards the center of Elt Island.

‘Ian, please be safe.’

Spores could catch you off guard. It was for this reason that I was
worried about Ian.

Unless something unexpected happened, Kaya, who had diligently studied
ecology, would cover for him.

I made my way toward the center, eliminating any illusionary monsters I
saw along the way.

In the process, an unmanned shop caught my eye.

\[There is no one around.\]

After I heard the report of the Frost Dragon, I headed towards the
unmanned shop without hesitation.

The unmanned shop was shaped like a cylindrical vending machine. Various
items were displayed beyond the glass window.

Various 1-star elemental magic scrolls, drinking water, odor removers,
useful ropes, netting, a camouflage sheet mimicking the surrounding
environment, a baby hippo-shaped doll, a portable toilet tent
*(expensive)*, and so on.

‘Odor remover for 120 points.’

The points I currently had amounted to 120.

I held my bracelet up to the unmanned shop and used all 120 points. The
mana grains in my bracelet flowed into the unmanned shop as payment.

The item popped out as I pressed the button for the odor remover.

The odor remover looked like a spray bottle. After spraying it several
times over my body, I put it into the magic pouch the academy had given
me beforehand.

With this, the illusionary demonic creatures and familiars would be
unable to distinguish my scent.

\[Hide.\]

“…!”

Suddenly, Hilde’s voice echoed. Reflexively, I hid behind a nearby tree.

\[There are magic beasts flying in the sky.\]

I took a quick glance at the sky through the gaps in the trees.

There were quite a few magic beasts flying around. I couldn’t tell if
they were the familiars of the proctors or were intentionally released
by unknown students.

Well, there was no benefit to standing out anyway.

I cautiously moved on.

……

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Whoosh──!*

\[Keeong!\]

Black wolf, an illusionary monster heard my footstep and rushed towards
me.

When the black wolf sniffed the ground, trying to track my scent.

I sent an \[Ice Spear\] at it, effortlessly eliminating it.

‘So far, so good.’

I could easily take down a Black Wolf, but starting with the Fang Hippo,
it was gradually becoming more difficult.

It would be better to avoid as many fights as possible. With Hilde as my
guardian, reaching the center of Elt Island without a fight wasn’t so
unrealistic.

\[There’s suspicious movement up above.\]

My thoughts were interrupted by Hilde’s report. I called her in for
help.

“What’s suspicious?”

\[It seems like an owl magic beast has been secretly spying on you. I
felt something was off from a while ago, and now I’m sure.\]

“…?”

A sense of unease washed over me.

If it intended to hunt me, it would have attacked awhile ago.

***So, it was monitoring me?***

\[…Master, hide.\]

Suddenly, Hilde urgently called out to me.

\[Humans are closing in on you. It seems like you are being encircled.\]

“What…?”

I heard a rustling sound. Several students were approaching me.

They were students from Class C and D, who had arrived on the same boat
as me. There were six of them in total.

Soon after, magic circles were conjured all around me.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud───!*

Solid walls sprung up around me, blocking my path. It was the magic cast
by the students who were rushing towards me.

“What the…?”

It was confusing…

I had no time to assess the situation. I placed my fingers together and
gathered mana to pierce through the layered defenses. The magic circle
for \[Frost Explosion\] was engraved into the air.

It was clear that these guys were my enemies.

Just then.

\[Kkiruk!\]

*Wiiiiiiiiiiiiii─*

I heard the sound of a bird’s cry from above and looked up.

A sight of an owl, wrapped in wind mana, dropping two mushrooms in my
direction was reflected in my eyes.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

A weak blade of wind flew from the owl and sliced the falling mushrooms.

Then, green spores spewed out like smoke.

A glittering powder poured over me.

“Oh, shi…!”

A mushroom that disrupted the mana circuit, temporarily preventing the
use of magic.

They were the spores of the Xerom mushroom.

The flow of mana was messed up. I couldn’t control my mana!

The magic circle for \[Frost Explosion\] dissipated immediately. The
condensed ice mana scattered into the air.

Soon, the \[Rock Wall\] trapping me turned into light brown powder and
disappeared.

“…!”

「Fireball (Fire Element, ★3)」

*Hwarururuk─!*

At the same time, a sphere made of flames flew towards me.

There was nowhere to escape. I hastily tried to deploy an \[Ice Wall\],
but as expected, nothing sprang out.

I had no other choice. I threw myself at the \[Rock Wall\], clinging to
it in a lying position, and shielded my face with my arm.

*Kuuuuung──!*

The \[Fireball\] slammed into the \[Ice Wall\] behind me, spreading
flames.

The \[Ice Wall\] melted.

I felt a brief flash of heat in front of my nose, but that was it.
However, the \[Fireball\] wasn’t particularly powerful. Phew, that was a
close call.

I quickly adjusted my posture and raised my head.

The students who were approaching me had gathered around a single female
student.

The leading female student had short brown hair and wore a headband
adorned with a red rose. It was a very familiar face.

“Hehe. Indeed, you look best when you’re scraping the bottom.”

The girl flashing me an arrogant smile was Rose Red Rivera, who had also
come on the same boat as me.

\[Rose Red Rivera\] **Lv:** 55

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Wind

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Feels inferior and envious of you.\]

The memory of the first semester’s practical training came to mind. At
that time, Rose had been grinding her teeth at me.

Rose was demoted from Class B to Class C in the second semester, based
purely on merit. So we ended up attending the same classes in the same
lecture hall.

Every now and then, when our eyes met in the lecture hall, she would
frown.

I could tell from her \[Psychology\] that she felt humiliated just by
being in the same lecture hall as me.

As I had suspected, Rose was planning to screw me over.

Perhaps she had assembled members on the ship to harass me. If it was
determined that there would be no issue harassing me after hearing the
contents of the exam, they would proceed according to her plan.

After entering the second semester, the Class D students who harbored an
inferiority complex towards me flashed through my mind. Some of them had
joined Rose.

***Damn… what idiots*.**

Suddenly, I was reminded of the conceited blond noble, Tristan Humphrey.
At least he intended to vent his frustration through a fair duel.

Their method was utterly pathetic.

“It’s strange, isn’t it? That you and I ended up in the same class.
Especially considering you, who had Grade E mana until last semester,
now have a higher mana capacity than me… it’s unbelievable, isn’t it?”

She had a lower mana capacity than me… she must be Grade C then.

“Why are you acting so high and mighty, you Grade E commoner?”

Rose had low self-esteem. She had a tendency to try to restore her
fallen self-esteem by any means, even if it meant belittling others.

Therefore, it seemed like Rose intended to satisfy her fallen
self-esteem by harassing me, the person she had looked down upon the
most, but had surpassed her in strength.

I stood up from my spot.

“You, you’re really annoying.”

As I said this, I pulled out a ‘Soli mushroom’ from my pocket. A
mushroom that negated the effects of all spores. I had picked it up on
the way, just in case.

It was a mushroom that released spores whenever it received a strong
impact. Squeezing it alone wouldn’t disperse the spores well, but
throwing it directly at the ground would do the trick.

At that moment.

「Fire Generation (Fire Element, ★1)」

*Hwaaaaaar*─*.*

“Ah, hot!”

The Soli mushroom was set on fire. I felt the heat and quickly let go of
it.

The Soli mushroom, set ablaze, fell to the ground. The spores inside
couldn’t withstand the bright red flame.

It was Rose’s magic. An incredible reaction speed that couldn’t have
been possible if she hadn’t anticipated my next actions. She seemed to
have taken into account the fact that I had prepared the Soli mushroom
in advance.

***What a bitch.***

“Who are you to be annoyed with me? You’re just a commoner to begin
with, aren’t you? Even if this is supposed to be a place of learning
where everyone is treated equally, did you really think we were on the
same level? Do you really think we are the same just because we’re in
the same class?

Rose showed a twisted smile.

“When you leave this academy, you’re nothing. You should feel honored to
be trampled on by me. You’re nothing but a pig. You need to know your
place.”

I got up, dusting the dirt off my clothes.

“…What’s with that arrogant look? Shall I fire another \[Fireball\]?
This time, you won’t be lucky enough to dodge it.”

“…”

“Ah, but if you say, *‘Lady Rose, please step on this worthless pig with
your dignified body,’* I might consider sparing you a little.”

“Is that so?”

***Aren’t you embarrassed by your own words?***

It made my skin crawl just listening to it.

“Sigh.”

I let out a deep breath. There wasn’t much to say.

Well, it was about time now.

The sound of something parting the bushes reached my ears. It would have
been better if it had come a little sooner.

I turned my head in the direction of the sound.

“Eden, you’re here.”

\[Kyuu!\]

What appeared was Eden, my small golem familiar.

Rose and her lackeys widened their eyes in surprise. Their looks asked
what was going on. I had not summoned the familiar, nor given him any
orders.

As soon as Eden revealed himself, he threw the blue mushroom he was
holding at me. It was a Soli mushroom.

The Soli mushroom that hit my body began to quickly spew out spores.

Whoosh, I took a deep breath. My tangled mana began to flow smoothly
again.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Thud───!*

“…!!”

I immediately created a wall of ice around Rose and her group.

A thick \[Ice Wall\], more advanced than the one Rose’s lackey had used,
rose up.

Rose and her group were trapped in the \[Ice Wall\], just as I had been,
with only one side open towards me.

It was time to pay back those wretched bastards.

“How impudent…!”

Before she could comprehend the current situation, Rose stretched out
her arm towards me to counterattack. The magic circle of \[Fire Pillar\]
was engraved in front of her hand.

Another student also tried to cast an offensive spell.

It was a foolish decision.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Hwaaaaaaar────!!*

“Ahhhh!”

I had already casted an offensive spell. They should have used a
defensive one.

The icy blue flame engulfed Rose and her lackeys.

With their rear and sides blocked by \[Ice Wall\], they had to endure
the full brunt of \[Frostfire\].

Of course, I had reduced the power. It would be a shame if they went
down in one hit.

When the \[Frostfire\] faded, Rose and her group were seen lying on the
ground.

Frostbite and chilblains appeared all over their bodies.^1^Editor’s
Note: A chilblain is a patch of swollen skin or blisters that appear on
the skin due to prolonged exposure to cold air. They mainly appear on
the hands and feet.

They were shivering fiercely from the bitter cold. It was an unsightly
outcome.

“Ah, ahhh…”

Rose groaned, her eyes bulging and her head bowed in agony. She seemed
to be in pain.

I walked toward her with large strides.

*Hwaaaar───!*

When one male student tried to counterattack, I casually launched a
\[Frostfire\] at him.

By the time the second cold flame had subsided, he had completely
collapsed. He didn’t even have the strength to stand up anymore. He just
shivered from the cold and pain.

I stopped in front of Rose and looked down at her.

Rose’s frostbitten face turned towards me. Her teeth chattered at a
rapid pace, and her body shivered violently.

\[Rose Red Rivera\] **Psychology:** \[She is terrified of you.\]

“What, what, how, did…?”

From the start of the exam, I had instructed Eden to be on stand by
whenever I found a Soli mushroom, in case I accidentally fell victim to
spores.

Whenever I found a new Soli mushroom closer to the center, I would
summon Eden and repeat the standby command.

I had previously instructed Hilde, ‘If I get hit by spores, bring Eden
to me immediately and have him throw a Soli mushroom at me.’

For example, if I fell victim to the Kulkul mushroom spores that forces
one into a deep sleep, I would have fallen asleep defenseless without
being able to use the Soli mushroom I had prepared. It was necessary to
prevent such misfortune in advance.

So when I fell into Rose’s trap, Hilde called Eden right away.

“Don’t look down on me… A Grade E, commoner, like you… don’t look down
on me…!”

I sent another \[Frostfire\] her way. Of course, I adjusted the power to
only cause moderate amounts of pain.

“Arghhhhhh!”

Rose screamed as she was engulfed in the cold flames. Thanks to the
\[Basic Protection Magic\] she had applied to her skin, she wouldn’t
suffer a lot of damage, but it seemed she couldn’t escape the pain.

As the cold flame subsided,

Rose, lying on the ground, began to wriggle and whimper.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry… it hurts too much… Please, spare… spare me…”

When I gazed down at her without responding, Rose grabbed the hem of my
clothes and began to plead.

This should be enough.

I didn’t want to waste any more time.

I turned around and began to move towards the center of Elt Island
again.

Then, Rose’s face contorted and slowly she started to regain her smile.

“Ah, ah… Yes, indeed… you’re just like that… You’re scared because I’m a
noble, right…? Hehehe…! You, you made a mistake…! Once I graduate from
the academy… I’ll make you live in hell for the rest of your life…!”

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

*Wiiiiiii, crash─!*

“Ugh!”

I dropped the block of ice I had previously frozen in mid-air.

Rose screamed once as the block of ice hit her on the head, and then she
passed out.

*Beep─*

A sound indicating an exam failure came from Rose’s bracelet.

Even the most arrogant nobles do not dare to say things like ‘Wait until
I graduate from the academy.’

***It’s a disgrace that tarnishes the name of the family.***

There was also an unwritten rule that what happened in the academy
should be resolved within the academy.

To ignore even that, what a character.

***I really don’t have any affection for Rose.***

“…”

I quickened my steps with a stoic expression.

Apocalypse -&gt; Evil God of Destruction. There are other smaller
changes as well.

Chapter 66: - Hunting Evaluation (3)
====================================

**༺ Hunting Evaluation (3) ༻**

The sky bathed in the hues of sunset as darkness descended upon Elt
Island. I had to reach the heart of the island before the shadows
settled.

Once night fell, it would provide a favorable environment for demonic
illusions and summoned familiars and increase the risk of being affected
by mushroom spores, making it difficult to discern your surroundings.

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

‘You’re doing great, Ian!’

I used \[Clairvoyance\] from time to time to check up on Ian and Kaya.
Fortunately, the two of them were moving toward the center of Elt Island
without issue.

***That’s the spirit. Stay strong, Ian!***

’…I’m the one who needs to stay strong.’

When Hilde had reported she ended up finding a fanged hippopotamus, I
gave up on fighting.

From this point on, I was concerned about becoming prey. I wanted to
follow the plan and recruit a companion, but I couldn’t find a suitable
candidate.

As I approached the center, the demonic illusions of Elt Island began to
take notice and constantly targeted me at every opportunity.

To prepare for any crisis, I draped a camouflage cloak I had purchased
from an unmanned shop over my shoulders. When the situation demanded, I
would immediately raise it, covering my entire body.

The camouflage cloak would change its design to match the surrounding
environment.

‘It looks as cheap as a beggar’s rag.’

The incident triggered memories of my time in military service, and I
suddenly recalled the annoying sergeant who tormented me during my
enlisted days. I felt like punching that jerk.

“Ugh!!! I’m starving─!!!”

“Huh, what the hell?!”

Suddenly, a female student came running, shrieking, and frantically
shouting. Her voice was husky.

She had an orange ponytail and golden eyes. She wore a modified school
uniform, with pants instead of a skirt. Her white shirt was completely
unbuttoned, fluttering like a flag.

As she sprinted towards me, she effortlessly swung a bat embedded with
mana stones, amplifying the power of her rock magic to crush the demonic
illusions with ease.

She was Lisetta Lionheart, a first-year Class A student of the Magic
Department.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Lv:** 98

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Irritated because she is hungry.\]

Lisetta had not unlocked her second element. It was a choice that came
from her desire to specialize solely in rock magic.

***By the way, where has she been hiding until now…? I remember her
being in the same boat as me.***

“What’s with all the weird stuff to eat around here!!! Argh!!!! I’m
hungry!!!!”

My guess was that she must have fallen asleep after eating some kind of
strange mushroom.

It would be nice if I could get her to be a companion, but her
overwhelming aura made me hesitant to approach her.

‘Well, I guess I don’t really need her as a companion.’

After all, Lisetta was charging straight toward the center, obliterating
all the demonic illusions and summoned familiars that stood in her path.

All I had to do was follow in her wake. After all, we were headed in the
same direction.

‘Amazing.’

***All aboard the Lisetta Express!***

***How convenient it is to have enemies annihilated for you!***

“Get out of the way, you wretches!!!!”

It felt relieving to be hard-carried.

\* \* \* \* \*

The abyssal blue darkness had descended. Fortunately, I was able to
follow Lisetta to the center of the island, near the volcano.

There was an artificially constructed 3-meter-tall door at the volcano.
It was the entrance to the volcano’s cave.

I put as much distance between Lisetta and me as possible and activated
\[Clairvoyance\]. She might be able to sense my magic.

I scanned the other side with \[Clairvoyance\]. Ian and Kaya were
currently facing the gatekeeper on the other side. The atmosphere
indicated that they were about to engage in battle.

The situation on my side was similar. I released \[Clairvoyance\] and
watched the confrontation between Lisetta and the gatekeeper.

“Hey, let me ask you a question.”

With Rock Bat slung over her shoulder, Lisetta asked the nearly
6-meter-tall magic beast without hesitation. It was a blue-skinned giant
familiar with sharp tentacles as its head. Flames flowed like blades
from its elbows.

“Behind you, in the doorway, you got anything to eat?”

\[Kuoooooo──!\]

“Damn it! There’s no one I can communicate with!”

「Flame Fist (Fire Element, ★3)」 「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」

As the gatekeeper swung a massive fist wreathed in flames, Lisetta swung
Rock Bat horizontally toward the magic circle she had manifested in the
air, casting her rock magic.

Four large rock pillars shot up from the ground, slicing through the air
and crashing into the gatekeeper.

*Crash! Crash! Kwaang!*

\[Kuooooooooo…!\]

A thunderous crash resounded. In quick succession, Lisetta unleashed a
flurry of strikes with her rock magic.

*Thud! Kwaang! Kwaang! Thud! Thud! Kwaang!*

**\[Rock Avalanche\], \[Rock Avalanche\], \[Rock Avalanche\]**

The gatekeeper eventually lost consciousness and collapsed under
Lisetta’s relentless series of attacks.

“How boring.”

***The Lisetta Express emerged victorious! Applaud!***

Lisetta clicked her tongue and walked towards the volcano’s cave
entrance, and with one hand, she pushed the door open. The door slid
open with such ease that she could hardly believe her eyes.

She smirked in disbelief and stepped inside.

‘The ride on the Lisetta Express is amazing.’

***Ah, this must be the taste of a sweet victory.***

Inside the volcanic cave, the final boss lurked. I should wait for
Lisetta to take him down.

By the way, the volcano’s cave wasn’t very deep, as it was built around
a volcano. Lisetta would soon encounter the final boss.

I used \[Clairvoyance\] again to check on Ian and Kaya. They had also
managed to defeat the gatekeeper.

Things were going well. A smile naturally formed on my face.

”…”

***…Things are going too smoothly.***

It felt awkward. For some reason, something always seemed to go wrong at
times like these…

Nope. Sometimes things did go smoothly, just as I envisioned them after
all.

‘Let’s think positively.’

***Today is a lucky day when everything works out well. Let’s think of
it that way.***

There was the variable of Rose, but overall, everything has been
manageable. I even taught her a lesson.

I forced a smile, hid behind a tree, and held my breath.

Time passed.

According to my \[Clairvoyance\], Lisetta had ventured into the depths
of the volcanic cave and defeated the final boss, a giant fire lizard.

I looked over to Ian and Kaya, and they were just about to face the
final boss.

In「Act 4, Chapter 3, Underground Giant」of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
Lisetta did not appear at all, which meant that she had most likely left
the volcanic cave after defeating the Fire Lizard.

‘I guess I’ll just have to wait until she comes out…’

I used my \[Clairvoyance\] to look in Lisetta’s direction again.

And I swallowed a sigh of frustration.

The giant, unconscious lizard. And above it… a schoolgirl with an orange
ponytail sitting with her legs spread open.

She had her Rock Bat rested lightly on her shoulder as if she were
waiting for someone.

It wasn’t difficult to guess the situation. Despite me trying to follow
her from a distance, it seemed that Lisetta had sensed my pursuit with
her feral instincts.

It was clear she expected me to follow, and she was waiting.

‘Oh, no.’

Strangely enough, my lucky day had taken a turn for the worse… The
biggest variable had blocked my path at such a crucial moment!

During the end-of-semester evaluation, I had the help of Luce, Kaya, and
Ciel. But now, I was on my own…

It wouldn’t be long before the Elphelt appeared. If I wanted to make it
in time, I had to get to where Lisetta was right now.

Ian and Kaya would defeat the final boss, and he would emerge. If I
followed the path, I should be able to reach them in 20 minutes.

“Haa, what a mess…”

I let out a deep sigh and released \[Clairvoyance\], resting my head
against the tree.

Lisetta had a strong fighting spirit. If she came face to face with me,
a battle was inevitable.

It would be impossible for me to defeat her. But…

‘There’s no other choice.’

The fate of the world was at stake. There was no time to whine. I had to
face her head-on.

I stepped towards the entrance of the volcano’s cave.

I entered the cave after opening the door. The air was humid. The cave’s
walls were a harmonious combination of white stripes on a clay-colored
surface. The interior was surprisingly bright for the time of night,
thanks to the luminescent lamps installed on the walls.

As I moved forward, the area of the cave grew larger, and not long
after, I reached a spacious area where the final boss of the Hunting
Evaluation appeared.

“You’ve come.”

From the top of the giant, motionless fire lizard…

…Lisetta Lionheart looked down at me with a mischievous smile.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Feels wary of you.\]

“Ah, it’s you. The extra bastard someone mentioned! Kehehe!”

”…”

“Did you think I wouldn’t recognize you, huh?”

Lisetta laughed, then suddenly hardened her expression.

Her rock mana flowed like the wind, skimming over my entire body. It was
an overwhelming aura that made me keenly aware that this was an opponent
I could never defeat.

Lisetta leapt off the fire lizard and landed on the ground, slinging
Rock Bat over her shoulder. With her remaining hand, she reached into
her pants pocket.

Beneath her undone shirt, a form-fitting tank top accentuated her
well-trained physique.

‘I took the wrong bus…’

***I didn’t realize this bus was heading for the cliffs…***

“Why were you following me?”

I didn’t bother answering. I knew the conclusion would be the same
whether I answered honestly or made up a lie.

I chose not to answer.

“Ha! You’re not even going to respond? What’s your name, then?”

”…Isaac.”

“I’m Lisetta Lionheart! I was personally interested in you!”

Lisetta’s distinctive booming voice and her usual burning desire to win
reminded me of a valiant gladiator.

“I was wondering why the top-seat, the second-seat, and the third-seat
were all tangled up with an extra brat like you? Especially the
top-seat, that bitch was so smitten with you she couldn’t even think
straight!”

With a smile on her face, Lisetta tilted her head to the side

“Well, it’s fine. I wanted to confirm it myself anyway.”

Then, a swirling magic circle of rock magic conjured around Lisetta.

Indeed, this flow again… Lisetta watched me closely, and I could feel
the tension rising. A cold sweat trickled down my cheek as I looked at
her battle-hardened form.

***Well, I didn’t come here without a plan.***

My plan was simple. I intended to throw a Xerom mushroom, which
temporarily disrupted the mana circuits, and then observe the result.
However, I knew that the effect of the Xerome mushroom wouldn’t be as
dramatic for Lisetta as it was for me. She was strong, after all. It
might just make her spellcasting a little uncomfortable, but I had to
try.

***Focus.***

I held my breath and conjured a pale blue magic circle, preparing for
battle. Using magic to divert attention, I would take the opportunity to
throw the Xerome mushroom.

The air grew heavy, and a sense of impending doom weighed down on me.

.

And then.

”…That’s enough.”

Suddenly, Lisetta withdrew her magic circle, an expression of boredom on
her face.

“That amount of mana… makes me want to die of boredom.”

***What the hell…?***

“Just by looking at it, there’s no way those first-rate bitches would be
interested in your mediocre combat skills… Was it for another reason? I
got my hopes up for nothing. Next time, bring some companions. You alone
won’t make a difference.”

Lisetta scratched my pride mercilessly. My forehead felt like it was
pulsating, burning with heat…

“Ah! Do you have anything to eat? I’m starving to death.”

”…”

“You got anything? Why aren’t you answering?”

”…Yes, I do.”

***…To prevent a bad ending, I have no choice but to do whatever it
takes.***

Since Lisetta might change her mind, I had to take the lead for now.

“Oh, really? Give it to me!”

Lisetta seemed delighted at the good news as a wide smile adorned her
face.

I let out a sigh.

Then, as Lisetta said, “Did you sigh?” and frowned, I hastily pulled out
a bundle from my pocket.

“Here you go.”

I presented the bundle to Lisetta, who eagerly received it and examined
its contents. It was a ‘Frostbloom flower’ that I had picked along the
way, an edible flower that constantly emitted ice elemental mana. The
round petals had been pre-cooked by burning them with a 1-star fire
magic scroll I had purchased from an unattended shop.

“Isn’t it strange? You try it first.”

Lisetta took out a Frostbloom flower petal that resembled candy and
forcefully put it into my mouth.

…It couldn’t be helped. I chewed on the petal, feeling its soft and
slightly salty texture, like eating a pickled vegetable dish. It was
definitely edible.

Lisetta was relieved to see that. She took out a Frostbloom petal and
popped it into her mouth.

“It’s not particularly delicious, but it’s good enough to eat…”

Just then.

*Rumbleee────!*

“Ugh!!!”

The ground began to shake! Dirt and dust fell from the ceiling, and the
luminescent lamps were doused with rainwater, causing the cave to
succumb to darkness.

The Underground Giant. It was a precursor phenomenon that occurred
before the appearance of the Elphelt. That bastard was about to appear!

I shouted urgently, “Lisetta, run!”

“Huh, what?”

“I told you to run, you idiot!”

“What…?”

Lisetta looked at me with a perplexed expression.

There was no time to explain. I had to get to Ian as soon as possible!

I started running towards the inner passage of the cave. If I continued
on this path, I would reach Ian and Kaya.

I checked the situation with my \[Clairvoyance\]. Ian and Kaya were
looking around in panic.

If I exerted my muscles for ten minutes and ran at full speed, would I
be able to reach them within ten minutes? I wasn’t sure… Either way, I
had to run at full speed!

“Hey!!! What’s going on?!!”

***No, why is Lisetta chasing after me?!***

“You! Do you even know what an earthquake is?!!”

“I told you to run!”

***You’re just getting in the way!***

“What?! Why do you keep giving orders on trivial matters, huh? Do you
want to die?!”

There was no time to convince Lisetta to turn back. Any moment now, the
giant’s gaping maw would swallow Kaya, and Ian would jump into it.

Lisetta and I ran toward Ian’s location.

I wasn’t sure if she would follow me until the end, but I hoped she
wouldn’t. Otherwise, I would have to show her how I fought against
demons.

The last thing I needed was more people – who weren’t even close to me –
to know my identity.

…Come to think of it, she was the type of girl who wouldn’t take any
orders from someone weaker than her.

‘Ugh.’

My head throbbed.

Chapter 67: - The Underground Giant (1)
=======================================

**༺ The Underground Giant (1) ༻**

「Act 4, Chapter 3, The Underground Giant」 of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

When Ian and Kaya defeated the final boss of 「Act 4, Chapter 2, Food
Chain」, the giant demon manifested from beneath the earth, exchanging
the surrounding terrain for its body. It looked like it was buried
alive.

The giant’s skin itself was level 190.

Reflecting on my gameplay memories, it seemed as though the demon was
designed in such a way that one couldn’t beat him unless they engaged
him from within his own body.

By delving deep into the giant’s inner structure, one could confront
Elphelt’s main body, which was level 145.

In comparison to the challenges faced in the first semester, it did not
pose an exceptionally high difficulty level. The patterns were
monotonous at best, and the fight itself felt more like a build-up to
Dark Kaya, which was truly excruciating.

Well, that shouldn’t be a problem for me, considering I was stronger.
Nevertheless, if Ian were to die today, this world would unconditionally
meet a bad ending.

*Kuuuuuuuuu───!!*

“Not again!”

The ground shook once again. For a moment, I almost fell, but I quickly
steadied myself and continued running through the eerie darkness of the
passage.

‘A second earthquake already…!’

The second earthquake signaled the beginning of 「Act 4, Chapter 3, The
Underground Giant」, and by now, the giant’s gaping maw must have burst
through the surface, devouring Kaya in a single gulp!

For the record, the underground giant was a deformed creature with a
disproportionately small head and an obscenely large body. Of course, a
giant was still a giant, no matter the size of its head. Its head alone
would have a diameter of approximately five meters.

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

I used \[Clairvoyance\] to observe the situation with Ian and Kaya and
as expected, a massive sinkhole had opened up on the ground.

Fortunately, Ian managed to avoid the sinkhole’s range, but it seemed
Kaya had already fallen into its depths.

At this point, Kaya’s body would start to resonate with Elphelt’s blood
mana, straining her body in the process. Her blood would boil, her blood
circulation would accelerate, her body temperature would rapidly rise,
and she would eventually lose consciousness. This was the process of
becoming a blood wizard, a practitioner of blood element magic.

Moreover, Elphelt’s minions would then capture Kaya and take her to
their master.

The mana radiating from the underground giant’s skin distorted had the
characteristic of distorting mana of the outside world. The performance
of that bastard’s skin was extraordinary. It was likely that it was now
rendering the entire Elt Island communication network practically
severed.

In the end, Ian wiped away his cold sweat and steeled his resolve with a
determined expression.

‘No! Wait!’

My desperate plea couldn’t reach Ian.

***He fearlessly plunged into the sinkhole, behaving like a damn
protagonist!***

“This is insane!”

I screamed, running forward with all my might.

Surely, Elphelt’s minions would be lurking within the giant’s body.
There was no way Ian could survive!

“Hey! Answer me! What the hell is going on?!!”

***Will you just shut the hell up?***

After about ten minutes, Lisetta and I finally reached the enormous
sinkhole.

The red mouth of the hole caught my eye. This was the underground
giant’s maw. Soon, the giant would close its mouth.

‘Ugh!’

Ten minutes. I was ten minutes late. I need to catch up to Ian quickly!
I didn’t even have time to put on the camouflage disguise I bought at
the unmanned shop. It was a garment that could completely conceal my
identity when combined with the camouflage cloak.

Lisetta was gasping for air beside me. It seemed she was struggling to
keep up with my pace.

“Ha, you asshole… you’re damn fast…”

I ignored Lisetta’s comment and jumped straight into the giant’s mouth.

*Ssshhh─*

My body began to slide downward along what appeared to be a tongue,
continuing through the passage that was most likely the throat.

The slimy touch was extremely unpleasant. If I had to give a comparison,
it felt like going down a waterslide that could break me down into
simple sugars.

Thanks to the poncho raincoat-like camouflage cloak, my backside didn’t
come into contact with the giant’s filthy saliva.

As I continued to descend down the throat, surrendering my body to
gravity, the slope gradually became more gentle. It was because the
giant was lying in a tortoise-like position with its head protruding
upward.

Finally, I passed through the throat.

“Ugh.”

I landed lightly, my feet touching the flat, reddish surface. It felt
unpleasant, sinking into the ground as if it were a mat, despite the
fact that I was wearing shoes.

The red walls of the giant’s interior shimmered as red mana floated into
the air, glowing like fireflies.

The colors were beautiful. Even the different forms of mana were
sparkling like jewels mixed with golden threads.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the inside of the underground giant had a
perfect blend of beauty and grotesqueness. The vivid realism brought out
its eerie beauty even more distinctly.

By the way, the underground giant had no disguise. So, what was the true
identity of this giant?

To use an analogy, imagine the underground giant as a colossal robot,
and Elphelt as its pilot. The twist here was that this giant was
actually Elphelt’s own body, and that bastard was the core of this
giant.

From my perspective, every inch of it fulfilled the conditions to
trigger \[Hunter\]. However, if I went on to cause a rampage within it,
a protective barrier would be cast over Elphelt. It was a defense
mechanism of sorts.

With each additional layer of the barrier, the giant’s defensive power
would increase dramatically.

In other words, using the wide-range attack \[Frostfire\] or
indiscriminately casting magic in all directions would be nothing short
of hastening a bad ending.

‘Anyways, I made it inside…!’

***Though it was delayed, I succeeded in entering the giant’s body!***

Now, I had to chase after Ian quickly!

And just as I was about to move my feet with those thoughts in mind…

“Yuck!!! It’s dirty-!!”

A grumbling voice began to resonate from the back of the giant’s neck
and slide down its throat.

*Kwoong!!*

“Uwah!”

“Ugh!”

Lisetta’s body suddenly slid out, and like a bowling ball hitting the
pins, it forcefully collided with my body.

I instinctively clung to Lisetta for a moment as a sense of pain and
dizziness washed over me. We both rolled and writhed on the squishy,
reddish surface, groaning in discomfort.

“Ugh…”

“Ah!”

For a moment, I genuinely thought my back had snapped.

***Argh, it hurts so much…***

“Where are we?!”

Lisetta jerked her head up towards the red ceiling in terror before
quickly straightening her upper body.

“Heh, unbelievable…”

In the end, that girl chased after me…

I let out an irritated sigh and stood up, starting to run inside the
space.

“You asshole, where do you think you’re going?!!”

Lisetta chased after me, shouting threateningly. I had expected as much.

As I ran, a vast space greeted me. A large amount of of red mana grains
floated around the interior of the giant’s body.

Red flesh stretched like chewing gum, connecting the ceiling to the
floor. There was a path that branched out into different directions.

***Where are you, Ian?***

I activated \[Clairvoyance\] and quickly scanned the area.

‘Found you!’

***Oh, Jesus Christ!***

Surprisingly, Ian was holding his own! He was narrowly defeating
Elphelt’s minions using their weakness, the light elemental sword!

‘That’s it!’

***You’re growing as well, Ian!***

I breathed a deep sigh of relief…

‘No, ugh…!’

Eventually.

Ian, caught off guard, succumbed to the magic of Elphelt’s minion and
fell unconscious, blood pouring from his head.

***Damn it…!***

“Hey!!”

Lisetta was chasing after me as expected. Still, it was a relief that
she didn’t use magic to stop me.

I read her thoughts with \[Psychological Insight\], I instinctively
realized that she knew about the situation and was acting accordingly.
She wasn’t brainless.

Lisetta and I quickly reached the space where Ian was. Ian was slumped
unconscious against the wall made of the giant’s flesh.

‘It’s not too late!’

***Phew, you idiot protagonist. I’m glad you’re safe… I thought my heart
would stop!***

\[Boooong, boong─────♪\]

In front of Ian, a bizarre-looking demon was humming and stomping its
feet with a strange rhythm.

It was a slender, elongated pink elephant that stood on two legs. It
seemed to be about three meters tall. Its head, made of pink skin,
scattered red mana powder intermittently. Its mouth was torn to extend
to its ear with a clown-like smile.

\[Buoh?\]

The elephant demon turned its head towards me and Lisetta. Its eyes,
pitch-black and large enough to resemble aliens, sent chills down my
spine.

\[Fall\] **Lv:** 90

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire, Blood

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to dance with your guts.\]

Elphelt’s minion, Fall.

Inside of the underground giant’s body were these elephant demons spread
out here and there.

The creature danced, wriggling its body. Its thick feet, contrasting
with its slender body, wiggled like worms.

\[Dance, buo-o-ok───?\]

The bastard asked with a dull voice. It was a proposal to dance together
to a single song.

By the way, it wasn’t a proposal directed at me. The creature was
referring to my guts.

It would rip out my internal organs, cover its entire body with them,
and then dance.

“What the…”

At the sight of that grotesque figure, Lisetta shook her head in
confusion. Her mind couldn’t keep up with the incomprehensible
situation.

*Zzingg-* With a buzzing sound, a crimson magic circle conjured in the
air, aimed at us. Fall’s magic had set its sights on us.

In an instant, the magic that flowed from it caressed my skin and passed
by.

“…Hey, move aside. That’s not an elephant you can handle.”

Lisetta must have realized the danger posed by Fall. She tightly gripped
the studded rod-shaped magic weapon, Rock Bat, in both hands.

When she tried to step forward in front of me, I extended my arm to
block her.

“What are you…?”

***I have to kill Elphelt quickly, save Kaya, and get the hell out of
here.***

Lisetta would only get in the way.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

My body became as light as a feather. I could feel the surge of mana
that would allow me to cast large-scale spell at a moment’s notice.

First, I had to save Ian and get the situation under control. I could
deal with the aftermath of revealing my identity to Lisetta later.

I reached out my right arm towards Fall and conjured a pale blue magic
circle in the air. It was the magic circle for \[Ice Spear\].

I formed a moderately sized \[Ice Spear\]. However, it contained an
extremely dense and potent concentration of mana. The dense, pale blue
mana swirled around the center of the \[Ice Spear\].

My aim was precise.

Just as Fall raised its elongated trunk to cast its spell…

I unleashed the \[Ice Spear\].

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Pshhhhh───!!*

*Hwaaaaaaaaa────!!*

\[Buooooooh───!!!\]

It happened in an instant.

The \[Ice Spear\] cut through the air like a bullet, piercing Fall in
the blink of an eye.

The spot where the \[Ice Spear\] passed was engraved in the air as its
traces of coldness took the form of flames. The wind pressure followed
and spread out in the aftermath.

Fall’s upper body was hollowed out, as if a cannonball had blasted
through it rather than a spear.

Just like that, it was over.

And Fall…. helplessly fell to the ground, a thud echoing through the
space.

\[On the shell… dancing…?\]

Soon, Fall’s figure uttered a faint voice before turning to ash and
disappearing.

The \[Hunter\] trait was released and my body felt heavy again. The
concentration of my mana drastically decreased.

It was strange, but I still couldn’t get used to it whenever the
\[Hunter\] trait was released…

“You… Your mana just now… What happened…?”

Lisetta’s voice trembled with astonishment.

I turned my gaze towards Lisetta. She stared at me with an expression of
disbelief, clearly confused.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Can feel your mana and is
confused by it.\]

It was the expected reaction. I had grown tired of it.

Once we entered the giant’s body, we couldn’t escape until I defeated
Elphelt. This place was not a safe haven by any means, as I didn’t know
where and how enemies ranging from level 85 to 100 would emerge.

Even if Lisetta was level 98, she was still in danger of dying if she
kept fighting similarly leveled enemies.

In other words, she was safest by my side.

“Lisetta.”

“Huh, what…?!”

“Don’t get away from me. Unless you want to die.”

The curious look on Lisetta’s face was gone. She remained tense, showing
only a guarded expression.

***She isn’t replying. People can be so indecisive.***

“Eden.”

I summoned my small golem familiar, Eden.

“Lift him up. We’re moving.”

Eden raised his right arm and responded with a booming sound, then began
to increase in size.

Boulders formed from thin air and clung to his body. Then, Eden
transformed into a two-meter-tall golem and began to emit a masculine
voice.

\[Kyu, kyu─!\]

Eden lifted the unconscious Ian in a princess carry.

I started to move along with him.

“Hey… Wait! Explain yourself!! Who the hell are you?!”

Lisetta followed after me.

She persistently questioned me for a while, but I remained silent. I
couldn’t think of anything to say in response after all.

<span id="0067_68_-_The_Underground_Giant_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 68: - The Underground Giant (2)
=======================================

**༺ The Underground Giant (2) ༻**

Before we knew it, we arrived at a vast square formed from the giant’s
bones. This was the place to form your party and gain EXP before
confronting Elphelt the Evanescent.

Lisetta furrowed her brows at the sight before her.

Energetic elephants, adorned in vibrant shades of pink or red, danced
and swayed joyfully. These were demons, their ears torn and their faces
twisted into eerie grins, humming tunes through their trunks.

A drumming elephant, slender and rhythmic, pounded drums made of flesh
with their elongated noses and created beats.

A guitarist elephant played magical bone-made instruments with quick,
tapping rhythms.

A singer elephant performed in an unknown language, melodically weaving
strange songs.

A chorus of elephants, arranged in a line, harmonized and sang together.

It was full of dissonance.

The elephant demons were utterly delighted by their peculiar music that
they were dancing in circles when…

\[Buoooo───?\]

…The elephant demons, the Fall, noticed our approach and halted their
dance. Their big, round, black eyes turned toward us in unison.

♪…

The music ceased, leaving nothing but silence.

\[Dance, buooh?\]

The leading elephant stepped forward and made a proposition to me.

After a brief pause, the rest of the elephants erupted with laughter,
their torn mouths splitting wide open.

\[Bukyakyakyakyakyakyak!! Bukyakyakyakak─────!!\]

\[Buoooh────! Baaaastarddd, Bakyayayayakak──!\]

\[Bukyakyakyakya──! Buhak! Bukyakyakyakyakyakyakya────!!\]

\[Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo────!!!\]

The elephants held their bellies while they rolled on the floor,
laughing hysterically. With their thick feet, they merrily applauded,
revealing toothless, black mouths as they chuckled and laughed.

***Perhaps I can make use of Eden here.***

“Eden, put Ian down.”

I gave a command to Eden, and he responded with a “Kyuu” and gently
placed Ian, whom he had been carrying, on the ground.

This was the Music Square. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it was safe to
run wild in this place. The bones forming the ground softened the
impacts transmitted to the giant’s body.

\[…Kyuu?!\]

As soon as \[Hunter\] was activated, dense rock mana flowed towards
Eden.

Eden was stunned.

His body began to grow larger and larger. One after another, flat
boulders were created from thin air and layered themselves on his body.

His piercing eyes glowed as he transformed into a solid 4-meter-tall
golem. It was his transformation into his humanoid form.

\[Eden\] **Lv:** (130)

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Amazed at his overflowing power.\]

“Take them down.”

\[Kyuuuaaahh───!\]

With a roar, Eden leaped forward in a straight line at incredible speed,
creating a gust of wind in his wake. His massive rock fist slammed into
one of the Fall.

*Pow──!*

An explosion-like sound resonated as one of the elephant’s body
violently traversed the air. It only came to a halt when it collided
with an enormous bone fragment.

It fell to the ground, lifeless.

The startled Fall hastily deployed their blood magic circle, unleashing
a barrage of blood-red magic spells.

However, it couldn’t even leave a scratch on Eden’s rock-hard body.

\[Kyuuoooooh───!\]

Eden soared upwards, and a large number of yellowish rocks appeared out
of thin air, clinging to his fists as if they were magnets.

He smashed the ground with his colossal fists.

*Kwaaaaaaaah───!!!*

The bones that made up the ground shattered, and the Fall were all
crushed without exception.

It was an extermination – a display of overwhelming power.

‘Hmmm.’

My heart swelled with awe as I realized it was the little golem Eden I
knew.

“Argh… Kaya… I must save Kaya…”

Just then, Ian, who had been lying on the ground, regained
consciousness. He groaned and held his head as he slowly raised his
upper body.

I quickly lifted the camouflage disguise over my shoulders to cover my
head.

*Whooooosh- Pow─!*

“Ugh!”

At that moment, a blunt piece of bone flew in a parabolic arc and struck
Ian directly in the head. It was due to Eden’s attack that the ground
shattered into pieces.

Ian let out a pained scream, then collapsed backward onto his back,
unconscious once again. Fresh blood trickled from where the bone
fragment had struck.

It was a ridiculous situation… At least I didn’t need to cover my head
with the disguise now.

\[Bugyak….\]

The Fall hoard were crushed beyond recognition, letting out a
distinctive groan as they turned to ashen dust and vanished.

Silence settled in.

Eden landed on the ground with a thud. The rocks that had covered his
body instantly dissipated into a light brown powder. His body shrank to
2 meters, the size it was before the battle.

\[Kyuu, Kyuu─!\]

\[Eden\] **Psychology:** \[Surprised by the fact that he was momentarily
stronger.\]

So, level 130 was his limit for now.

***If he continues to level up and gradually becomes stronger, one day
he’ll be as good as a high-level familiar.***

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 69!\] \[You have gained 2 stat
points!\]

***I leveled up. Yesss.***

“Come on, Eden. Pick up Ian again.”

\[Kyuu!\]

I called out again, and Eden rushed over and lifted Ian back into a
princess carry, followed by Lisetta and me.

“…”

***Come to think of it, when did Lisetta become so quiet?***

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Feels inferior, doubtful, and
fearful in your presence.\]

…Well, the reason was obvious. I decided to ignore her for now.

As we passed through the wide doorway-like passage, an overly spacious
dome-shaped room emerged and overwhelmed us.

We had reached the bulging abdomen of the Underground Giant.

“Where are we…!?”

A startled Lisetta gasped in shock, but I quickly clamped my hand over
her mouth.

“Quiet.”

“…”

She nodded, and I lowered my hand. We continued to move forward.

The mana, scattering bright crimson light, served as illumination.

The walls bubbled with blood, and the malformed ceiling emitted a
crimson glow around the ribs’ gloomy hue.

Below, darkness took hold beyond the cliff.

A line of flesh-like legs led straight to the center of the room. At the
end, the torso of a giant red elephant, its head resembling a brain,
stood tall.

It was the main body of Elphelt the Evanescent.

‘What’s going on?’

For some reason, the creature hung limply, its head bowed and lifeless.
Just like a corpse. Shouldn’t it have been doing a bizarre dance and
greeting us with vigor by now?

…And then, it happened.

*Crack─*

In the middle of the giant elephant’s head, someone raised their upper
body, revealing their figure.

Her long, flowing hair and white school shirt were drenched in the
elephant’s blood, staining them a deep scarlet. Crimson blood flowed
down her fair skin. After a moment of hesitation, she swallowed and
wiped the blood from her lips.

Her usual emerald eyes turned into a chilling, lifeless red, and gazed
upon us. They were vacant eyes devoid of the faintest glimmer of life.

Then, as soon as she caught sight of us, her cheeks flushed, a
mysterious smile creeping onto her lips.

“Isn’t that… the second seat…?”

Lisetta’s voice was filled with alarm.

Above the head of the gigantic elephant demon, a light green-haired
female student peered down upon us. She was Kaya Astrean, the boss who
had awakened as both a blood wizard and a demon.

\[Kaya the Ravenous\] **Lv:** (160)

**Race:** (Demon)

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant, Blood

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:** \[Hopes you can stop her insatiable desire for
slaughter.\]

‘Why is Kaya showing up already…?’

Even more surprising was that she was ten levels higher than the
original scenario.

For a brief moment, I was taken aback, but I quickly regained composure
and quickly came to a decision.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 4, Chapter 3, The Underground
Giant」, Kaya the Ravenous was a hidden boss who appeared right after
the player defeated Elphelt.

She emerged from within a whirlpool of crimson blood, formed by piercing
through a membrane of crimson mana as an incomplete blood wizard
awakening.

Now, Elphelt had forsaken its own elephant body and all of its
functions, including intelligence, and had become a parasite with Kaya
as its host. All that remained were instincts akin to bloodlust.

However, the current scenario’s Kaya seemed to have successfully
awakened early. That was why Elphelt must have transformed into a
parasite and already attached himself onto Kaya.

Though not visible here, there used to be a red earring-like object
dangling from Kaya’s right earlobe. It was Elphelt who had transferred
itself to her.

Kaya would be unable to suppress her murderous intentions towards humans
in her presence. She had no choice but to submit to Elphelt’s will.

***I’m sure that her current smile was born from Elphelt’s delight at
finally being able to devour humans.***

‘She’s still a long ways away from becoming a full-fledged demon…’

If I were to be defeated by Kaya the Ravenous, I would face the bad
ending「Gluttony 」. According to that scenario, it would take Kaya half
a day to transform into a full-fledged demon. There was still time to
reverse the situation.

Kaya was most likely ten levels higher than in the original scenario
because she had awakened as a complete blood wizard.

By the way, using blood mana had its own side effects. Although harmless
to the body, Kaya would have to live with those side effects once this
part was over. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, these side effects served
as a part of Kaya’s charm.

***By the way, why did Kaya awaken as a blood mage so quickly?***

‘…Perhaps it’s the fact that she resonated with plant mana earlier than
expected.’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Elphelt was aware that plant mana
harmonized well with blood mana. That was why he had tried to control
Kaya.

Kaya couldn’t use plant magic at the time, so her awakening as a blood
wizard was incomplete. In contrast, the current Kaya was fully attuned
to plant mana and could even use plant magic.

There was no doubt that the plant mana had instantly fused with the
blood mana. It was something I hadn’t anticipated.

However, that wouldn’t stop me from saving Kaya. After all, the fact
that I was stronger remained unchanged.

If I inflicted a fatal blow on Kaya, Elphelt would protect her for his
own survival and attempt to flee while in a weakened state. In that
moment of weakness, I would seize the opportunity to kill him. Kaya
would then revert back to her human form.

\[…\]

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」 + 「Flower of Evil (Blood
Element, ★6)」

= 「Carnage (Wind + Blood)」

*Whoosh─!*

A gust of reddish-green wind blew Kaya the Ravenous away from Elphelt’s
grasp. The fierce wind swept the blood off her body like an air
compressor, but it couldn’t clean the already crimson-drenched uniform.

Through the gale that dominated the space, Kaya gazed down upon me.

I could see the crimson floral tattoo that ran down from her right cheek
to her neck. It was the \[Flower of Evil\] that appeared whenever she
activated her blood mana.

Her lips twisted into an enigmatic expression—seemingly smiling and
crying at the same time—making it impossible to discern her emotions.

However, the icy red glint in her eyes were directed squarely at me.

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★6)」

I cast an \[Ice Barrier\] on Lisetta, Ian, and Eden to neutralize my ice
magic.

“Are you going to fight?”

I nodded at Lisetta’s question.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[The level and stats are temporarily greatly
enhanced!\] \[The skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

As I steeled myself to confront Kaya the Ravenous, my unique trait
\[Hunter\] activated.

Once again, I channeled rock mana to Eden and issued a command.

“Eden, watch over Lisetta and Ian.”

\[Kyuu!\]

Eden nodded, as if to assure me he would safeguard them. He would shield
them from the aftermath of the fight between me and Kaya.

Kaya the Ravenous constantly enveloped herself with an abundance of
mana, enabling her to soar through the air like a breeze. I recalled the
inconvenience Ian faced at his inability to fly in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ as he had to spend a large amount of mana to keep wind around
him at all times.

I, on the other hand, was capable of aerial combat.

Besides, if I stayed with Lisetta and Ian on this narrow bridge, we
would all become her targets.

I bent both knees and leaped toward the ceiling like a spring.

*Whoosh─!*

Breaking through the reddish-green wind, I reached a height that even
skyscrapers could barely reach.

“Are you even human?!”

Lisetta exclaimed, but I simply ignored her.

***“Come forth, Hilde.”***

I held my left arm out in front of me and activated my 8-star familiar
summoning circle.

A pale blue summoning circle appeared on my left wrist. In response,
condensed white jade mana gathered in the air, transforming into the
colossal form of a white dragon.

*───────── \[Kaaaaaah────!\]*

\[Frost Dragon Hilde\] **Lv:** 180

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Ice

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Delighted to fight alongside you.\]

The 8-star magic beast, Frost Dragon Hilde roared.

I jumped onto the back of that white dragon.

Chapter 69: - The Underground Giant (3)
=======================================

**༺ The Underground Giant (3) ༻**

“Why did I do that, seriously…”

Located in the Duchy of Astrean.

The vast expanse of shrubbery in the Astrean Manor boasted an
eye-catching panoramic view that seemed to come straight from a
watercolor painting. This was thanks to the subtle flow of mana from the
Emerald Fairy, Sylphia.

The wide paved path stretched ahead without obstruction, which was one
reason why the Duchy of Astrean was referred to as the center of
commerce.

It was summer vacation, and Kaya Astrean had returned to the Astrean
Manor.

Unlike when she left for the Märchen Academy in high spirits, upon
returning to the mansion, she showed a devastated appearance which
startled the household staff.

The reason was that she had contemplated her mistake during the carriage
ride.

For a while, Kaya had no appetite and would hardly touch her meals. Her
walking was sluggish, and she would bury her face in the pillow on her
bed at night, sighing deeply.

She couldn’t help it. She felt like she was going crazy.

During the vacation ceremony, she couldn’t control her soaring emotions
and impulsively kissed Isaac on the cheek.

***He must have felt burdened by that, right? Of course, he must have.
There’s no doubt about it.***

How many times had she repeated the phrase*, “Why did I do that?”* since
that day? She had been drowning in the swamp of regret for days now.

She couldn’t even bring herself to talk about it.

If word got out in the manor that Kaya was in love with someone, her
father, Gerald Astrean, would definitely be furious.

He was an upright and conservative man. He had strictly forbidden Kaya
to have romantic feelings, let alone a relationship until she graduated
from the academy and met someone befitting of her ducal title.

The only friend she could confide in, Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy, had
somehow managed to disappear within the forest.

**…Kaya was going crazy.**

Night. Time to sleep.

In the dark room, Kaya was tossing and turning in bed.

“Why did I… why did I do that. Ugh.”

Kaya sobbed, clutching her Armana Wand, the magic weapon Isaac had given
her during the end-of-semester evaluation.

For several days, she had repeated this pattern before falling asleep.

“…”

Of course, the regretful memory of the vacation ceremony wasn’t the only
one that lingered.

Moonlight was streaming through the window. Kaya turned her head to gaze
outside.

A bright, crescent moon.

A similar crescent moon hung in the sky on the day they went to Tantak
Underground Cave on Märchen Academy grounds. It had been so memorable to
Kaya that she could even remember the shape of the moon.

It was the day she went camping with Isaac. She remembered that day
vividly, her heart pounded so that she felt like it might burst with
tension, and even now, that memory was fresh in her mind.

He had wrapped his blanket over her, and told her she was beautiful.

The smooth feel of the wand in her hand brought back memories of her
end-of-semester evaluation.

***He was adamant that I was someone he approved of. He has no idea how
happy I am every time I think about those words.***

“…I miss you, Sir Isaac.”

She felt it all over again.

Before she knew it, Isaac’s presence had seeped into Kaya’s life like
moonlight.

\* \* \*

\[Master, could it be that this child… is the Kaya you have telling me
about?\]

“Don’t mind her.”

When asked by Frost Dragon Hilde, I replied normally as I threw off the
bothersome cloak of camouflage. No matter how twisted the scenario
became, the only way to save Kaya was to defeat her.

Elphelt, who had become a parasite in the form of an earring, shared his
blood with Kaya. In that parasitic state, he had the highest level of
elemental resistance.

Just as a giant’s outer shell distorted external mana, Elphelt had the
power to neutralize at least one spell.

So, if I could inflict fatal damage on both Kaya and Elphelt at the same
time, Elphelt would unconditionally endure my attack and exert all its
strength to restore its host, Kaya.

There was no other suitable host after all, and as expected, someone
sharing blood with a corpse would just end up dying.

Then, he would have ten minutes where he would be weakened and
vulnerable to my attacks. Of course, I had no intention of allowing him
to escape during that time.

With the giant red elephant as its center of gravity, Hilde flew in
circles inside the giant’s overly wide body.

In the center, Kaya Astrean, floating in midair on a reddish-green wind,
stretched out her arms toward me.

With an expression of longing on her face, she seemed to find me
appetizing. Although my muscles were quite developed and made me appear
quite appealing, I had no intention of being eaten.

Next, a multitude of magic circles materialized in the air. The colors
green and crimson blended together to form eight of them.

Behind her, grotesque chunks of flesh sprouted like tentacles,
intertwining and forming shapes resembling crimson tree trunks. Leaves
composed of human appendages densely bloomed all around.

The result was the emergence of a grotesque tree that radiated a
brilliant crimson glow.

「Tree of Radiance (Plant Element, ★7)」 + 「Flower of Evil (Blood
Element, ★6)」

= 「Tree of Blood (Plant + Blood)」

I remember being intrigued by that spell, created by combining the plant
and blood elements, in the guidebook. I wondered if it was going to be
released in the future as a DLC since it didn’t appear in the game.

This tree provided swift and dramatic recovery by offering blood and
flesh to allies. It was a higher-level version of \[Tree of Radiance\].
It was explicitly stated to be an unbalanced skill.

It was even said that if Kaya had summoned this tree in 「Act 4, Chapter
3, The Underground Giant」, there was no way to defeat her.

The only strategy was to render the tree unusable with a single attack.

\[Buooooooooh─────!!\]

\[Bururuk, Bururuk, Bururuk──!\]

\[Bbbuuuuiiiiiiiiik──!!!\]

\[Bugyagyagyagyagyagyagyak──!!!!\]

\[Ppugyaaak──!!!!\]

The wall made of the giant’s flesh began to spew out winged, crimson
elephant demons. Each one was nothing less than a member of Elphelt’s
body.

They swarmed like an army of ants, each holding a spear of bones in
their hands.

With eerie cries, they flew towards me.

Hilde stopped gliding through the air and flapped her wings, gazing at
Kaya. The white dragon’s massive wings shimmered and scattered pure
white cold mana as they swept through the air.

‘Frostscythe.’

I extended my right arm to the side and instinctually summoned the
Frostscythe. Pale blue mana gathered in the air and took the form of a
chilling, dark blue scythe. The Frostscythe heeded my call.

As I grasped it, additional ice mana flowed into me as if I had opened
an energy tank.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** (169)

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman Who Has Adapted to Student Life

**Mana:** (155000) / (119000) + (250000)

– Mana Recovery Speed (S)

Every time Hilde cast a spell, it took a nasty chunk of mana out of my
summon upkeep.

It wouldn’t hinder me as much, though, as a large amount of bonus mana
that Frostscythe provided would be consumed first.

“Slaughter them.”

I commanded, pointing the Frostscythe’s head at Kaya.

Above my head, a magnificent pale blue arc of magic traced a path. It
was Hilde’s magic circle.

Hilde’s mana glowed with brilliance, spreading out as an
all-encompassing force.

Soon, the magic circles set up by Kaya responded, and they all released
their magic at once, aiming at Hilde.

「Song of the Mountain Goat (Wind Element, ★7)」+ 「Blood Siphon (Blood
Element, ★5)」

= 「Baphoment’s Hymn (Wind + Blood)」

A reddish-green typhoon surged with the sharpness of a thousand blades.

Without distinction, the entire army of crimson elephant demons were
ruthlessly shredded by the blades of wind.

One of Kaya’s official patterns, \[Baphomet’s Hymn\].

This wind spell gradually increased in power as it absorbed the blood of
slain creatures.

───────── \[Kaaaaaaaaaaa────!!!\]

In defiance, Hilde unleashed a spell with a fierce roar.

「Hell of the Crimson Lotus (Ice Element, ★8)」

In an instant, shimmering silver lines appeared in the air.

*Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa────────────────!!!!*

With a thunderous noise, the lines transformed into a massive beam of
light, pouring out extreme coldness.

\[Hell of the Crimson Lotus\] devoured \[Baphomet’s Hymn\] and
annihilated the elephant-like demon horde that had approached me.

The world was bathed in a pristine white, and the surroundings were
covered in a white frost.

For a moment, even time itself felt frozen.

I remained calm, quietly blinking my eyes.

A frozen army of elephant demons came into view. Hilde’s cold beam
hadn’t directly hit them.

***This isn’t a stroke of luck.***

*Crackle──*

*Crackle───*

Hilde’s cold beams burrowed into the bodies of the elephant demons and
went on a rampage.

Soon, like a flower bud bursting into a full bloom, their flesh began to
tear in all directions.

*Whoooooosh───*

An eerie crimson landscape amidst the white world.

\[Hell of the Crimson Lotus\]. One of the eight great cold hells, and a
spell that freezes and bursts one’s entire body with intense cold,
transforming it into something akin to a crimson lotus flower.

True to its name, everything that came at me had transformed into
falling crimson lotuses, plunging into the darkness beyond the cliff.

After defending Kaya with all its might, the \[Tree of Blood\] grew into
a humming mass of flesh. Its trunk splintered into many branches as
Hilde’s cold beams churned within it, turning it into crimson dust
before vanishing.

It was a futile end.

“What the…”

Lisetta, protected by my \[Ice Barrier\], exclaimed in a shaky voice.

The surrounding landscape regained its warmth as the giant’s blood
flowed, turning red again.

\[…\]

Kaya’s face hardened. She began to fly away sideways.

One after another, masses of crimson venus flytraps bloomed on the wall
made of the giant’s flesh. The hellish carnivorous plants had mouths
with rows of neatly aligned white teeth.

「Parasitic Ensnarement (Plant Element, ★5)」 + 「Vampirism (Blood
Element, ★4)」

= 「Field of Slaughter (Plant + Blood)」

*\[Keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee──!!!\]*

*\[Keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee──!!!\]*

*\[Keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee──!!!\]*

*\[Keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee──!!!\]*

*\[Keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee──!!!\]*

Young, eerie laughter echoed from the carnivorous flower horde, \[Field
of Slaughter\]. It was a spell that would drain me of my blood.

I felt a sensation inside my body as if the flow of blood was being
twisted. If I stayed still, the blood coursing through my body would
pierce my skin, float through the air, and fall prey to the \[Field of
Slaughter\].

With that many, not a drop of my blood would remain.

That wasn’t the end of it. A huge, grotesque flower bloomed, filling the
entire wall. Its petals, like those of a clockwork flower, pulsed with a
brilliantly colored bloodstream.

In the center of the flower, a round mouth gaped open, revealing a
multitude of sharp thorns akin to a snail’s mouth. It was like a passage
that led to another dimension.

The giant flower with a gaping mouth. It was the \[Apocalypse\].

「Hell Flower (Plant Element, ★8)」 + 「Flower of Evil (Blood Element,
★6)」

= 「Apocalypse (Plant + Blood)」

\[Apocalypse\]. The setting stated that no living thing could survive
where this flower bloomed, and the area around it would inevitably
perish.

Kaya, hovering in the air with her back to the \[Apocalypse\], glared at
me.

She seemed to have decided to go all out after being attacked by Hilde.

“Hilde, charge.”

\[Understood\].

Hilde began to fly towards Kaya.

「Ice Sovereign’s Majesty (Ice Element, ★7)」

A brilliant pale blue light emitted from my body. It was \[Ice
Sovereign’s Majesty\]. a spell that repelled all incoming attacks.

The \[Field of Slaughter\] stopped its laughter, and each one gushed out
copious amounts of blood from their mouths, withering away.

Then, the radiance that had been emanating from me faded.

The horde from the \[Field of Slaughter\] that had withered helplessly
bowed their heads in silence.

Soon, \[Apocalypse\] unleashed a magic circle where luminous iridescence
and vivid crimson colors harmoniously intertwined, aiming at me. Its
size was impossible to gauge at a glance.

“Kaya, please endure it.”

As I flew through the air, I leaped upward, kicking off Hilde’s back. I
did this to get a good swing of the Frostscythe.

The flapping hem of my uniform fluttered as I firmly gripped the
Frostscyth with both hands.

A pale blue, flame-like mana, intensely surged around the Frostscythe.
As I swung it horizontally, shimmering pale blue lines appeared along
the path of the Frostscythe, cutting through Kaya’s abdomen and the form
of \[Apocalypse\]. The lines then expanded rapidly, devouring everything
the scythe touched.

「Absolute Zero (Ice Element, ★7)」

*Chaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!─────────────!!*

Frostscythe’s unique active skill, \[Absolute Zero\].

It was a spell that indiscriminately cut and froze through everything in
its path without regard for spatial limitations.

\[Apocalypse\] and the giant’s wall of flesh were frozen and split in
half due to the chilling beam that had penetrated deeply through them.
Even the spot where the Frostscythe had sliced was frozen solid.

Suddenly, vividly colored blood spurted from Kaya’s earlobe and
enveloped her entire body.

The blood that had restored Kaya from the brink of death clumped into a
single mass, taking the form of a small elephant.

It kicked off Kaya’s body and leaped against the wall to escape. I
opened the status window to identify the small elephant.

\[Elphelt the Evanescent\] **Lv:** 145

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire, Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to live.\]

***Yeah, no.***

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

I quickly conjured a huge iceberg in mid-air to sustain my leap. With a
burst of speed, I dashed through the air like a bullet towards the
fleeing Elphelt.

*Kwaaang────!!!*

The pressure built as I thrust the iceberg, recreating the sound of
cannon fire.

The Frostscythe turned into pale blue dust. I had put it there
intentionally. Instead, my hands were now filled with a dense mass of
ice mana.

\[Ppukeuh?!\]

As I approached the Elphelt the Evanescent floating in the air, I
detonated the concentrated mana in my hands.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah─────────────!!!!*

The ice exploded, engulfing Elphelt in a flood of ice. Weakened by
defending Kaya for his own survival, his body was shredded to pieces by
the force of an instantaneous explosion. He was trapped inside a massive
iceberg that had formed in a matter of seconds.

Kaya lost consciousness and began to fall. Hilde swooped down and caught
Kaya in her mouth. Hilde turned to me and started carrying me on her
back.

Finally, Hilde flew to a fleshy leg and gently placed Kaya on the
ground.

I also descended from her back with a perfect landing.

*Kuuuuuu────!*

The giant ice chunk landed with overwhelming force. I gently extended my
hand toward the giant ice chunk.

*Shalalalak──*

The ice melted away. The massive iceberg instantly turned into a light
blue powder and disappeared.

\[Ppukeuk…!\]

Elphelt, who had been pouring out blood, let out a pitiful cry before
turning to ash and scattering in the wind.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Elphelt the Evanescent
(Level 145)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to
72!\] \[You’ve gained 6 stat points!\] \[You have unlocked the
achievement ❰Dance on a Shell?❱! You have gained an additional 10 stat
points!\]

My body rapidly grew heavier as the \[Hunter\] trait was deactivated.

Rewards could be savored later. The loot would be left with Kaya, so I
could check it out afterwards.

I quickly hoisted Kaya onto my back.

\[Whew, we won. I am glad we fought together, Master──\]

The mana cost of maintaining the summon was extremely high, so I
immediately unsummoned Hilde.

‘Maast-’

She tried saying in a confused voice, before disappearing in a blur of
light blue mana.

***I’m sorry, Hilde, blame your weak master.***

With Kaya on my back, I began to run.

I urgently shouted at Lisetta, who had been staring at me in admiration
up til now.

“Lisetta! Run!”

“Huh, what?!”

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu—*

The earthquake began, and Lisetta was startled.

Upon the defeat of Elphelt, the giant’s body would slowly turn to ash,
starting from its core. In its wake, soil, seawater, and other things
that were originally there, would begin to return to the area where the
giant once stood.

Touching them would instantly trigger the bad ending, \[Live Burial\].

In other words, we had to run full speed to the giant’s mouth. It was
the final mission of 「Act 4, Chapter 3, The Underground Giant」.

From the center, eerie crimson mana began to surge. The mana transformed
into masses of sand and the ground.

The blood-colored mana gradually spread like a suffocating force.

‘Huh, shit!’

***It’s actually scarier in person!***

“Run, run!”

I let out a yell that bordered on a scream, and ran at full speed
alongside Eden, who was carrying an unconscious Ian, and Lisetta.

<span id="0069_70_-_The_Underground_Giant_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 70: - The Underground Giant (4)
=======================================

**༺ Underground Giant (4) ༻**

“What now?!”

“It’s collapsing!”

“What for?!”

“Because the main body is gone!”

“Was that elephant the main body?!”

I took the lead and rushed ahead. As I continuously searched for the way
back with \[Clairvoyance\], despite feeling dizzy, I was able to move
forward without hindrance.

If I looked back even for a moment, I could see the blood-colored mana
chasing after us with the terrifying momentum of a tsunami. Touching it
meant certain death.

Kaya was slumped against my back, unconscious.

Kaya’s usual faint body odor was nowhere to be found. Instead, it was
replaced with the smell of blood and guts.

“But what are you running for?! Your golem could have carried you! It
was so big and fast! Don’t you think?!”

I barely resisted the urge to shout back.

I couldn’t leave Kaya to Eden, who was carrying Ian while running. He
had his own limits too, of course. Despite his level increasing and
becoming faster, he was showing signs of exhaustion from being drained
of concentrated rock mana twice. If I had entrusted Kaya to him, our
running speed would surely slow down.

“And what’s with you? You’re not even within human standards to begin
with!!”

“Argh! Shut up! Summon your familiar or something! You’re not even
helpful, so why complain?!”

“Ah?!! You’ve said enough…!”

Lisetta glared at me, seemingly realizing she had almost slipped up.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Afraid of you.\]

Lisetta was a woman whose fighting spirit ignited when she was faced
with strong opponents. Her fear of me seemed to stem from the
overwhelming sense of powerlessness she had experienced.

“Damn it…!”

Lisetta summoned Jeff, her rock-armored lion familiar.

\[Heh! You’re going to drench me in the dreadlocks of a new battle
again, master!\]

As soon as he was summoned, Jeff roared with a valiant voice.

However, after hearing the commotion, he turned around and was so
startled that his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

\[Eek!!! What’s going on?!!\]

“Enough with the small talk! Just carry Kaya on your back!”

***Man, both the master and familiar are noisy.***

Nevertheless, Lisetta had some sense. She could see that I intended to
protect Kaya.

I had to run ahead of her. No matter how strong I was, if I ran at full
speed with Kaya on my back, I was bound to slow down. Lisetta must have
realized that.

I carefully moved Kaya from my back onto Jeff’s. The process stopped me
in my tracks for about two seconds to adjust. Fortunately, I still had
some leeway since I had been running even before the giant’s body
started to collapse.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

I immediately froze Kaya in place on Jeff’s back. We picked up the pace,
my body feeling much lighter now.

Lisetta admired my ability to find a path without obstacles, saying,
“You’re a good navigator!” She seemed unaware of the existence of
\[Clairvoyance\].

Soon, we reached the giant’s throat.

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」

I created a stone staircase leading up the wide opening. It didn’t reach
the top, but it didn’t matter since Lisetta and I alternated in building
a staircase.

We started running up the rock stairs.

“Oof!”

“Jeez, don’t you have any strength in your legs? If you don’t want to
die, don’t fall!”

“Do you think it’s something I can control, you brat?!”

The tremors made Lisetta stumble, but I caught her wrist and pulled her
up. After I let go of her wrist, I continued climbing up the throat with
her.

From the base of the throat, layers of the ground were piled up, making
it feel like a burial site.

***Just a little further! We’re almost there!***

“Phew!”

At last, we succeeded in getting out and made our way into the mouth!

I then made a trail of rocks in the mouth and stepped on it.

The smell of the giant’s mouth, the sticky saliva, and even the
suffocating atmosphere were all repulsive. It was a thoroughly
unpleasant space.

“The ceiling…!”

The teeth formed a tightly sealed ceiling. I could make it out because
the reddish-blood mana that flowed around it acted as a light.

Well, it didn’t matter. We were safe here.

“It’s alright.”

“What do you mean, it’s alright?!”

Before we knew it, the blood-red tsunami, now forming solid ground, was
almost upon us. Startled, Lisetta screamed, covering her face with her
arms.

The crimson mana engulfed everything, reaching the giant’s mouth before
it turned into dust and disappeared.

Only a massive sinkhole remained where the giant’s mouth used to be—This
sinkhole was made by the giant sticking its head out of the ground to
create an opening, so it remained unreplaced by the ground.

Suddenly, I felt a floating sensation. Underneath my feet was the center
of a dark abyss.

“What is this?”

We began to fall in unison.

As far as I could remember, this sinkhole wasn’t that deep. Still,
falling directly into it would mean certain death.

“It’s not that high, so quickly make some rocks!”

“What? Ah!”

Lisetta used \[Rock Generation\] to form a large boulder.

*Drrrrr───!*

The landing point was higher than expected. Thanks to that, we were able
to smoothly land on the boulder Lisetta created.

“Huff, huff…! We almost died!”

Lisetta exclaimed as she caught her breath while sitting on the rock. I
felt the same…

***We really almost died.***

‘It’s over…’

I sat down like her, deeply relieved.

The male lion familiar, Jeff, chimed in with a fascinated tone, ‘I’ve
never encountered a crisis like this before…

And with that, we sat there for a while, breathing hard and collecting
our emotions.

‘Are Kaya and Ian okay?’

As soon as my breathing calmed down, I turned to Jeff, the lion
familiar.

I glanced at Kaya on his back.

***She’s sleeping peacefully.***

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** (140)

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant, Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[ \]

The \[Flower of Evil\] that had been crawling from her neck down to her
cheeks had long since vanished.

***I’m glad she’s okay, but…***

‘Temporary level 140…’

The side effect of awakening as a blood wizard.

There was a setting that the blood element created a new personality.

This meant that the personality of ‘Kaya the Ravenous’, who uses blood
magic, was still present within Kaya.

The temporary level 140 displayed was probably because the status window
measured the humanized Kaya the Ravenous at that level. She was 10
levels higher than the original scenario, most likely due to her fully
awakening as a blood wizard.

In addition, the humanized Kaya was safe. She no longer had the
murderous or demonic instincts that Elphelt the Evanescent had instilled
in her.

To be clear, her entire personality hadn’t changed. There was just a
dramatic shift in her character but ultimately, Kaya was still Kaya.

Except that in order to wield blood magic, she had to become the
personality of her ravenous form.

‘What about Ian?’

Next, I looked at Ian Fairytale, who was being held by Eden.

The blood on his forehead had dried up. He should be fully healed by
now. He had the light element constitution, so his resilience was
excellent.

If he woke up along the way, I planned to use \[Black Ice\] to conceal
my appearance. That way, I could buy enough time to hide my true
identity. The real question was whether Lisetta could keep her mouth
shut.

\[Notification from the Academy\]

Just then, the voice of Professor Fernando came through from the
bracelet.

It seemed that the communication magic had finally activated, now that
the interference from the giant’s shell was gone.

\[The Hunting Evaluation has been urgently terminated. We are currently
conducting rescue operations, so please remain in place and report any
unusual occurrences immediately… Re-transmitting…\]

“Hey.”

Lisetta called out, sitting up in a pseudo-slouch as she rubbed her sore
shoulder.

“Can I say something?”

“Since when did you need my permission to speak?”

Lizetta furrowed her brow with irritation, but she didn’t lash out at
me. She took a deep breath to calm her emotions.

It surprised me that Lisetta managed to control her temper. Perhaps that
was the power of logic.

“I won’t ask for details. If it’s something that someone like you can’t
reveal, it must be something big. A demon must have brainwashed the
second seat. It’s all so strange.”

”…”

“You’re the black monster, aren’t you? You must be hiding your identity
on purpose.”

I nodded in agreement.

“I have reasons. I’ll reveal everything when the time comes, so keep it
a secret for now.”

“Then what are you going to tell the academy? It’s ridiculous to brag
that we’ve defeated a demon of this magnitude all on our own. They’re
probably tracking our location in real-time, and the second seat is
covered in blood, so they’re bound to realize that we’ve been involved
with a demon.”

“What else can we do? We’ll just say the black monster appeared.”

”…”

With a determined expression, Lisetta her eyes and then, grasping onto a
rock, stood up from her spot.

Soon, she opened her eyes again.

“For now, let’s organize our thoughts and actions. I know which side
you’re on.”

Her demeanor had changed.

“But tell me one thing. Why are demons appearing so frequently? Is there
some hidden secret within this academy?”

“I can’t tell you that either.”

It was a fact that I had kept to myself, fearing the complications it
might bring.

Especially when it came to Kaya, with whom I felt a sense of camaraderie
with. I didn’t want to burden her with this knowledge, much less
Lisetta.

“…Do you always bear this weight on your own? Ha, how amusing. Even if I
knew, I wouldn’t be able to help, fool. Even such an absurdly strong
bastard like you has been struggling. So, what could I do?”

She laughed softly before sighing.

I didn’t have anything to say, so I didn’t bother answering.

“People like you… I wish I hadn’t known. It would have been better.”

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Feels a strong sense of
inferiority towards you.\]

It was a cliché for someone who thought of themselves as a genius to
become frustrated in the face of a true genius.

I wasn’t a genius, so I couldn’t fully understand, but right now,
Lisetta might be feeling something similar.

‘I don’t care.’

***Of course, her feelings are none of my business.***

“Let’s go back, now,” I said, rising to my feet.

If I used elemental magic to create stairs and ladders leading from here
to the sinkhole above, we would easily escape to the outside.

Lisetta, along with Eden and Jeff carrying Ian and Kaya respectively,
followed me wordlessly.

\*\*\*

The situation outside the sinkhole was quite dire. The earthquake had
caused the cave to collapse, blocking the path.

The effects of the giant’s outer shell must have left the wizards
powerless.

The Imperial Knights would have had a hard time clearing away the
rubble. They hadn’t yet dispatched anyone who could easily clear such
rocks.

However, now that the giant had vanished, everyone would be able to
easily use magic to deal with things such as rocks and debris.

Lisetta and I made our way towards the exit while we cleared debris with
elemental magic.

We were safely rescued by an exam proctor who was rushing over from the
other side.

The academy’s staff was fully engaged in rescue operations, using wind
magic and makeshift carriages to transport the students. We boarded a
makeshift carriage and headed towards the dock.

The students gathered at the dock were speechless as they saw Lisetta,
Ian, Kaya, and me. The awkward silence hung in the air for a moment.

“Isaac…!”

Suddenly, a female student with long, rose-golden hair rushed toward me.
Her complexion was as pale as a corpse, and she looked utterly
terrified.

It was Luce Eltania.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Deeply relieved that you are safe.\]

Luce stopped in front of me and Lisetta, and immediately turned her
head. It seemed as though she was assessing the surrounding situation,
other than only me.

There was Ian, unconscious with blood flowing from his head.

Kaya was also unconscious, and her school uniform was drenched in red.

The normally feisty Lisetta looked exhausted.

As for me, there were traces of damage on my school uniform from Rose’s
attack during the day.

While the healers rush to help Ian and Kaya onto a stretcher, Luce
chewed her lip with a stern expression on her face.

“Top seat?”

”…”

Her azure eyes, as deep as the ocean, turned to Lisetta when she called
out to her.

After seemingly organizing the thoughts in her mind, Luce suddenly bowed
deeply to Lisetta, expressing her gratitude.

“Thank you.”

”…!”

Lisetta was taken aback. All the onlookers were equally bewildered.

The top seat had always been suspicious of anyone who approached her,
and had always shown a cynical attitude to everyone other than Isaac.
She never cared about anyone else. So this sincere expression of
gratitude surprised the onlookers.

“You protected Isaac, didn’t you? Thank you so much…”

Lisetta was supposed to go along with my story.

Though Lisetta must not have been expecting this situation since she was
the one who had been protected. However, she managed to remain silent
while breaking out in cold sweat.

***Thank you for keeping your promise.***

Then, Luce raised her head and approached me. No, she ran towards me.

“Lu…”

*Hug.*

Suddenly, she hugged me tightly, burying her face in my chest and
feeling my warmth.

She wrapped her arms around my waist, refusing to let go. It was as if
she never wanted to be separated from me ever again.

“I’m so glad you’re okay, Isaac. I’m so, so… glad.”

Her voice, as soft as the moonlight, sounded as though she was on the
verge of tears. I could feel her struggling to keep them from falling.

My heart tightened. The sight of someone genuinely caring about me to
shed tears for me was both precious and beautiful.

I gently held her shoulders, pulled her away from my embrace, and looked
into her eyes with a soft smile.

“Don’t worry about me, I’m fine. Thank you, Luce.”

After a while, Luce locked eyes with me before giving me a wry smile as
she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes.

“Isaac, stay with me from now on. Don’t leave my side, okay?”

“Sure. I don’t mind.”

“Well, put this on then.”

Suddenly, as if she had prepared it in advance, Luce pulled out
something resembling handcuffs.

***What is this?***

“What is that?”

“These are handcuffs. I bought it at an unmanned shop.”

***Wait, seriously? They’re actually handcuffs?***

“Here, let’s put this on our wrists. Then, we can stay close to each
other.”

”…”

“I can’t help it. It might get dangerous again… You need to stay close
to me, Isaac.”

Her expression showed sincere concern. I knew she was genuinely worried
about me…

However, Luce’s judgment, stemming from her emotions, was twisted in a
rather wrong direction.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Feeling a strong instinct to protect
you.\]

“I’ll protect you, Isaac. So, from now on, you’ll be safe by my side…
Ah! Isaac?!”

I instinctively backed away from Luce, fleeing for my life.

Chapter 71: - Hunting Evaluation Interlude (1)
==============================================

**༺ Hunting Evaluation Interlude (1) ༻**

“So, when will you start dating the top seat?”

Inside the ship back to the academy, Lisetta and I sat across from each
other, with a table between us. We were the only two in the room.

By the way, Ian and Kaya were resting in their respective cabins, each
serving as their own private hospital room.

Just like in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the Truth Investigation
Committee had hastily assembled on the ship.

If there was any indication that the situation had yet to end, it was
necessary to respond as quickly as possible.

Afterward, accommodations were given to the people involved in the
incident to allow them to rest their minds and bodies as much as
possible.

Lisetta and I were interrogated first.

Ian and Kaya would be called in after they were awake and well-rested.
By then, we would have already arrived at the academy.

They would call us in again if there were any discrepancies between my
statement and Lisetta’s.

However, there shouldn’t be any discrepancies. We had already prepared
our statements in advance, and she matched my words well.

As for how we aligned our stories.

1.  *I stumbled upon Lisetta and followed her to the central region,
    where I could earn a lot of evaluation points.*

This was the truth. At this point, my location was being tracked by the
bracelet, so I couldn’t afford to lie.

1.  *After seeing Lisetta enter the volcanic cave, I followed her
    shortly after. However, I ended up running into her and then an
    earthquake occurred.*

This was where the bullshit began. After the exam bracelet had lost its
location-tracking function from the underground giant’s mana
neutralization ability.

1.  *The earthquake had collapsed and blocked the way back, so Lisetta
    and I started looking for another way out. That was when I fell into
    a sinkhole.*

<!-- -->

1.  *She jumped in to save me, but since we couldn’t go back the way we
    came, we were forced to explore the insides of the giant demon’s
    body to find another exit.*

<!-- -->

1.  *We came across the unconscious Ian and Kaya on the way, and had our
    familiars carry them along.*

<!-- -->

1.  *Suddenly, the Black Monster appeared. Acting as if a Deus Ex
    Machina, it slaughtered all the demons.*

<!-- -->

1.  *We made a skillful getaway.*

The end.

The Truth Investigation Committee’s official list of members included
the student council president, Alice Carroll. Hence, it would be better
to avoid having our statements investigated after arriving at the
academy.

***By the way, Lisetta, you bastard, you’re talking nonsense.***

She was slouching in her chair. Exhausted, she seemed to be spouting off
whatever came to mind.

“It’s not what you think.”

“Oh, were you already dating? You’re doing great, asshole.”

“…”

Luce was currently traveling on a different ship.

When I ran away from the dock, Luce showed signs of summoning Galia, so
I immediately made a U-turn. I didn’t expect her to summon an 8-star
familiar just to chase me.

I made a stupid excuse like, “I thought I left the exam bracelet
somewhere else, but it was on my wrist, haha.”

Then she awkwardly giggled and said, “Of course it is.” When I read her
psychology, she thought I was trying to make her laugh by cracking a
joke.

***As if I would do something like that, you idiot.***

Afterwards, I explained that I had to go on a separate ship to cooperate
with the investigation of the incident.

Although this was before the professor had instructed me to do so, I
wasn’t wrong according to the scenario.

Luce shot me a suspicious glare.

Thankfully, Professor Fernando’s voice called out from the bracelet just
in time, calling for Lisetta.

*─Can I not follow you?*

*─From what I was told, no.*

After a final exchange of words, Luce walked away with a wistful
expression.

‘I didn’t think you’d do that to a friend.’

I liked Luce, but her tendency to cause an Extra Bad Ending was
terrifying.

I thought I would be fine as long as she didn’t find out I was Greung…
That was a mistake.

Sooner or later, I would have to firmly lecture her as if teaching a
child. I would tell her, ‘Luce, no matter how worried you are, it’s
wrong to physically restrict a person’s freedom.’

In response, Luce would likely refuse with logic, but I had a card up my
sleeve called throwing a tantrum based on strong moral principles. With
it, I could somehow break through her logic.

Soon, the door opened, and a female healer came in.

“You two said you would be Kaya Astrean’s guardians, right? You may come
in now.”

After she spoke, Lisetta and I stood up and started moving.

While it wasn’t a large one, an entire room was being used as Kaya’s
private hospital room.

The healers must have examined her condition and found nothing wrong
with her body.

As a result, they must have felt the need to prioritize the stability of
her mind rather than her body.

Preferably, the guardian would be someone close to the victim so that
they could put her heart at ease.

In the corner of the room was a female healer, reading a book while
waiting.

Kaya was silently sleeping under the bed’s covers, dressed in
light-brown robes that the female healers had changed her into.

By the way, the loot had been taken in advance while we were returning
to the dock from the volcanic cave. It was a by-product in the form of
earrings on Kaya’s earlobe.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 140

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[ \]

‘Ravenous or not, you’re still the same as ever.’

I visited Kaya for three reasons.

***First, to match statements with her.***

Kaya would regain consciousness before the ship arrived at the academy.

This was my only chance to talk with her, as the Truth Investigation
Committee would immediately call for her.

With the healer in the corner of the room, it would be difficult to
communicate verbally.

After Lisetta and I were rescued by the proctors, we were then escorted
to the dock in a carriage.

I wrote my message down on a piece of parchment I had purchased from an
unmanned shop, planning to pass it to Kaya.

***Second, I’m worried about Kaya.***

I had a fondness for Kaya. I couldn’t help but worry about her.

I sat in the guardian’s seat next to her bed.

“You’re not going to that light element guy from earlier?”

“He has Amy and Mateo, so he’ll be fine.”

That was why I decided I could be Kaya’s guardian.

As expected, the two of them volunteered to be Ian’s guardians by asking
the professor.

They were currently having a conversation with him in his hospital room
after he regained consciousness. I knew from using \[Clairvoyance\]
earlier.

By the way, I didn’t have to match statements with Ian. He had fainted
and was out cold the entire time.

“Ugh, I don’t care whether either of them drops dead or not. I’ll just
go rest. I’m tired.”

“Alright.”

Lisetta left the hospital room.

Before she closed the door, she snuck a glance at Kaya.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Worried about Kaya Astrean’s
physical condition.\]

There seemed to be a sense of camaraderie as members of the same class.

‘I’ll have to give her a little hint that Kaya’s okay later.’

Silence fell after Lisetta closed the door.

I quietly looked at Kaya. Her long straight hair, different from her
usual twin tails, suited her quite well.

I stroked her pale cheek with my fingers. It felt soft to the touch. She
was adorable, like a puppy.

She was a girl who liked me as a man. Although there were twists and
turns, it was fortunate that things ended safely.

From now on, I would have to face the dual personalities of Kaya. No
matter which personality, the fact remained that it was Kaya herself.

…Just as I was thinking that.

*Chuu–*

“…!!”

Suddenly, she nibbled my finger. It happened faster than I could react.

I felt a soft and moist sensation. Startled, I reflexively pulled my
hand away.

Kaya opened her eyes and looked at me.

It was… very bewildering.

“Kaya?”

Flushed red cheeks. A flirtatious smile.

Eyes that were clearly different from her usual emerald green. Rather,
they were a distinct and unfamiliar crimson hue.

“Sir Isaac, why were you caressing my face like that? Did you want to
touch me that badly\~?”

There was a hint of slyness in her cute voice.

I already knew that Dark Kaya’s personality was overflowing with
confidence to the point where she actively made moves on the player.

It was a total mismatch from her usual shyness when seeing me, which
left me speechless.

Kaya’s eyes drifted to the hand that had been stroking her cheek.

“You can touch me more if you’d like…”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Loves you as a person of the opposite
sex.\]

She bore an expression full of longing. ***So damn cute…***

“Hmm.”

At the corner of the room, the healer who had been sneakily glancing in
our direction cleared her throat, deliberately trying to be heard.
Kaya’s behavior seemed to be making things awkward.

***Keep it together first. Calm down.***

“How are you feeling?”

I calmly asked. Then, Kaya jerked her body upright.

“I’m fine. My body is just a little stiff.”

“Aaah…”

She moaned and stretched.

Then, Kaya intently stared at me. Her red eyes, glistening vividly with
the color of blood, held a radiance that was far different from my own.
It was mysterious, to say the least.

“What? Do you have something to say?”

I asked because it felt awkward to silently make eye contact.

An unexpected question came out of her mouth.

**“Can I kiss you?”**

*Pfff–!*

The healer, who had been drinking juice in the corner of the room for
quite some time, spat it out and coughed.

Her reaction echoed my own.

“…Pardon?”

Unconsciously, I let polite speech slip out.

<span id="0071_72_-_Hunting_Evaluation_-_Interlude_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 72: - Hunting Evaluation - Interlude (2)
================================================

**༺ Hunting Evaluation – Interlude (2) ༻**

“Well then, I’ll take that as a yes.”

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whirl—–!*

“…?!”

Suddenly, Kaya used wind magic to send the blanket that had been
covering her flying upward.

She then raised her hand to my face and began to lean in.

It was an incredibly unexpected situation.

*Whoosh─*

As Kaya’s wind subsided, the blanket floating above descended and
enveloped the two of us.

Within that stuffy blanket, our breaths began to intermingle.

“Sir Isaac.”

Kaya suddenly stopped right in front of my face, and began to whisper in
a serious voice.

“I will give my full thanks to you later. Please quickly finish the task
at hand.”

Despite the healer shouting angrily at the sight of us covered under the
blanket, Kaya remained resolute.

‘Wow…’

For a moment, I thought the usually passive Kaya would actually kiss me,
causing my heart to race. Despite having just awoken, weren’t her
actions a little too bold…?

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Kaya actively showed her affection for Ian
in her ‘Ravenous’ form. So, this was how it felt firsthand…

I finally understood why Ian was so taken aback by Kaya’s actions
in-game.

Regardless, it seemed Kaya was quick to grasp the fact that we needed to
secretly communicate.

Kaya was well aware that I had to hide my identity.

“You’re quick on the uptake.”

Relieved, I softly uttered a compliment.

I pulled out a piece of rolled-up parchment and discreetly passed it to
Kaya.

The parchment contained instructions for Kaya that I had thought of in
advance.

*Rustle─!*

“What do the two of you think you’re doing!?”

The healer swiftly lifted the blanket covering me and Kaya.

“E-Even if you’re dating… there’s a time and place for that! Isn’t that
right?!”

The healer scolded us with an angry expression.

Suddenly distancing herself from me, Kaya calmly apologized to the
healer.

After glaring back and forth between the two of us, the healer angrily
returned to her office.

As I watched the healer leave, I suddenly felt an itchy sensation on my
thigh.

“…!”

The cause was Kaya running her finger up and down my thigh.

She was writing something out with her finger.

***─Did your heart race?***

Our gazes met. She placed her other hand on her lips as she tilted her
head towards me. Her luscious emerald-green hair cascaded down her
shoulders.

A mischievous yet confident smile adorned her face, accompanied by an
overwhelmingly seductive sensation.

Just looking at her made my mouth go dry.

That smile was meant for me, and me alone.

Soon after, she began tracing out words on my thigh again.

***─My heart raced.***

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Wants to kiss you.\]

She continually expressed her affection for me without hesitation,
openly enticing me to see her as a woman.

This feels a little…

‘Surprising.’

It felt as though all my energy was being drained…

\*\*\*

Late at night.

Other than Dark Kaya’s attempts at seduction, there were no unusual
incidents throughout the rest of our cruise.

Once the ships docked at the academy’s port, all students were let off.
By now, the bracelets for the hunting evaluation had already been
removed.

Afterwards, the Imperial Knights and academy’s staff began working
together to investigate the incident on Elt Island.

Kaya and Ian were moved to the infirmary. As previously mentioned, they
would rest there until they were called by the investigative committee.

Lisetta and I were also informed they may call on us to testify as well
before sending us back to our dorms.

However, on the way to my dorm, I was accompanied by Luce, who was
waiting for me. It was truly a relief that she didn’t bring out those
ominous handcuffs again.

I was now back in Briggs Hall.

Immediately after I arrived back in my room, a sense of relief washed
over me. Naturally, all the energy in my body disappeared.

I didn’t even have the energy left to take a shower, so I opted to
simply lie on the bed instead.

‘At least I got this.’

I took out a red earring from a hidden pocket in my uniform.

This loot was called ‘Blood of the Evanescent’. I had taken it from
Kaya’s ear.

If one swallowed this, even if they were on the brink of death, they
would be restored to perfect health in an instant.

Even if they had lost a part of their body.

Note that since this was a single-use item, there would be no effect if
one melted and consumed it bit by bit.

‘I have to use this carefully.’

I was planning on saving it for Ian if needed, since I was worried that
he might die.

It might be obvious, but the world was set to hell mode. Even the most
seasoned of players would barely be able to clear it.

I couldn’t fault Ian for constantly fainting. That was why I had only
complained internally.

To be honest, I was just grateful that Ian was still alive.

If he just acquired the Luminous Sword and used \[Expelled from
Paradise\] at the right moment, I couldn’t ask for anything more.

‘Next… I have to think about how to allocate my stat points.’

I opened my status window.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 72

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman Who Has Adapted to Student Life

**Mana:** 7000/7000

– Mana Recovery Speed (C+)

– Stamina (B)

– Strength (B)

– Intelligence (C+)

– Willpower (A+)

Ever since I reached level 51, I could feel a rapid increase in my mana.

It would continue to increase at an even greater pace after I reached
level 101.

I was also sure that my \[Mana Recovery Speed\] would likely increase in
rank within a few days.

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 18 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (B+): 56/100 \[UP\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (A+): 81/100 \[UP\]

– Learning Efficiency (B+): 57/100 \[UP\] ◈ Elemental Resistance – Fire
Resistance (D-): 10/100 \[UP\]

– Water Resistance (D+): 16/100 \[UP\]

– Ice Resistance (C+): 34/100 \[UP\]

– Lightning Resistance (B-): 39/100 \[UP\]

– Rock Resistance (D): 12/100 \[UP\]

– Wind Resistance (C-): 23/100 \[UP\]

– Neutral Magic Resistance (D+): 18/100 \[UP\] ◈ vs. Race Combat Power –
vs. Human Combat Power (E): 4/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Other Races Combat Power (E): 1/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power (E): 0/100 \[UP\]

– vs. Demon Combat Power (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

‘Now, I should be able to reach S rank in \[Magic Training
Efficiency\].’

I invested 5 stat points in \[Physical Training Efficiency\], 10 stat
points in \[Magic Training Efficiency\], and 3 stat points in \[Learning
Efficiency\].

\[Your potential in \[Physical Training Efficiency\] has increased from
B+ rank to A- rank!\] \[Your potential in \[Magic Training Efficiency\]
has increased from A+ rank to S rank!\]

Now, my \[Elemental Firepower\], \[Elemental Efficiency\], and
\[Elemental Synergy\] would increase at a faster rate than any other
freshman.

Perhaps by my sophomore year, I would be able to reach the upper ranks
of B Class.

“…”

Sleep swallowed me like the tide.

I groggily closed my eyes, and soon fell into a deep slumber.

\*\*\*

The stifling summer breeze was replaced by a cool autumn wind.

The trees surrounding Orphin Hall adorned themselves with red and
yellow, creating a subtle yet enchanting atmosphere.

While Lisetta and I had been called due to the ongoing Elt Island
investigation, we weren’t called before the investigative committee.

We were simply asked to provide a description of what the interior of
the giant demon looked like.

Imperial Knights were relatively sparse within the academy, as many of
them had been dispatched to Elt Island.

‘Let’s think about what’s happened so far.’

In the early morning hours, I was lost in thought as I walked through
the garden of Orphin Hall alone.

It would be better to be thorough about the scenarios.

‘Firstly, the Elt Island incident.’

The appearance of the giant demon had tarnished the reputations of both
the academy and Imperial Knights.

The first issue was that the bracelet created to protect the students,
failed to fulfill its intended function.

Not only were the students potentially endangered, there was a
significant period of time where they couldn’t determine their
whereabouts, and they couldn’t even establish communications.

Even if there were no reported casualties, it was still a serious issue.
Criticism about the academy’s inadequate response began to spread.

As a result, Märchen Academy would lose a significant portion of its
investors.

‘Demons with the power to nullify mana no longer exist, but only I know
that.’

From the academy’s point of view…

***…Is there any guarantee that such a being wouldn’t appear again?***

Of course not. Therefore, they had no choice but to prepare for that
possibility.

By now, they were probably dealing with a horrible headache, but with
the support of the Imperial Knights, it would probably be resolved.

The second issue was that the Imperial Knights, despite being present at
the examination site, were unable to stop the demon.

Still, this would likely distract some people from criticism of the
Academy.

Consequently, this disgrace would lead to them dispatching higher
skilled individuals to Märchen Academy as support. Kaya’s sister, who
was also a member of the Imperial Knights, would likely come.

‘Regardless.’

The scenario was over, and everything flowed smoothly. However, two
problems remained on my end.

The first was that the academy had discussed the possibility of me being
the Black Monster. I found this out by using \[Psychological Insight\].
They based it on the fact that I also use the ice element.

However, they quickly concluded that I was too weak to be the Black
Monster.

‘The one suffering right now is Alice.’

With the existence of an ‘informant within the Academy’s Administration’
revealed, Alice Caroll was left unable to act freely.

Without substantial evidence, she couldn’t harm anyone based solely on
her suspicions.

***The second problem was Dark Kaya.***

‘What on earth am I going to do about her?’

I had predicted it, but her expressions of affection were overly
aggressive, leaving me unsure of how to proceed.

Until I defeated the Evil God, I didn’t want to focus on anything except
getting stronger. This was especially true for any kind of relationship.

“Huh?”

As if on cue, Kaya was walking towards me.

Come to think of it, Class A had reserved the training grounds during
the previous time slot.

Kaya’s green hair was tied in her usual twintails. Her pupils had also
returned back to their usual emerald.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** 100

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant, Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Currently feeling embarrassed towards you.\]

Upon seeing me, Kaya froze in place and began to shake.

It was as though a young deer was quivering in fear after coming face to
face with a predator.

As our eyes met, both of us remained still.

“S-s-s-s–s-s-sir Isaac…!”

***Isn’t her voice shaking a little too much?***

“T-The weather is very nice…! Looking at how beautiful the trees are,
it’s totally autumn now! A-Are your classes going well? W-Well, for
someone as great as Sir Isaac, your classes probably don’t mean much to
you…!”

Whilst sweating profusely, Kaya rambled on nervously.

Judging from her psychology, it was clear she vividly remembered what
she had done on the ship.

Now that we had met, it would be a good opportunity to discuss whether
she had followed the instructions I had given her, or if something had
happened.

“S-So I think I should express my gratitude to you! Haha, hahahaha!
W-where are you heading? The training grounds? Well, for someone like
Sir Isaac, such a place is trivial…”

“Kaya, you know what happened on the ship-”

“AH!!! AHHHHH!!!”

Pleadingly, Kaya covered her reddened face with her hands and cried out
in distress, as if begging me not to say those words.

Even her ears were flushed red.

That surprised me…

“AHHHHHH!!!”

Unable to bear it any longer, Kaya turned and began sprinting away at
full speed, her screams echoing in every direction.

I was so bewildered, that I just stood there in shock.

Chapter 73: - Gift
==================

**༺ Gift ༻**

The wind grew increasingly chilly as I traversed the road adorned with
colorful fallen leaves.

Lately, more and more students were wearing cape shawls over their
school uniforms, me included.

With the incident on Elt Island coming to a close, discussions about
demons had become commonplace between the students.

*─ Is there a person among us who can control demons? Maybe someone like
a hidden mastermind.*

*─ That’s a little much…*

*─ Yeah, let’s stop with the conspiracy theories.*

*─ If there was someone like that, wouldn’t their mana capacity be
visibly massive?*

*─ Could it be Luce? She has an S rank mana capacity.*

*─ It can’t be. If it were her, there’s no way she would have been
attacked by demons last semester.*

*─ It’s probably not the Star Witch either, since she fought against the
demons.*

*─ Then it’s almost certain that the demons are after one of us?*

*─ Probably.*

By now, most students at Märchen Academy had realized that the cause of
the frequent demon appearances was highly likely to be one of the
students.

Otherwise, there would be no explanation for their dormancy while the
students were on vacation.

It was a logical conclusion.

From my perspective, the constant appearance of demons was like having a
meal at lunch break.

It was simply the law of the academy genre.

The evening was filled with a calm atmosphere.

Within Josena Forest, located near the Academy’s entrance, there was a
lake densely flowing with mana.

At night, it would become even more vibrant.

I was currently seated on a stump nearby.

On the day I walked to Orphin Hall, Kaya had given me a note.

There was nothing abnormal about her.

Inside, she had written that she would like to meet me ‘here’, to
properly thank me.

In addition to the note, there was also a cute drawing of the
destination, ‘Norhan Lake’.

I wasn’t seeking any sort of repayment, but I had agreed to meet,
because we had a lot to talk about.

I had decided to fully explain myself to Kaya today.

‘Did I come too early?’

I hurried here immediately after classes had ended, but I probably could
have taken my time.

While holding a mana meter, I continually circulated mana through my
hand, using the spare time to train my \[Elemental Efficiency\].

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew behind me.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whoosh–*

I could feel the flow of mana along with the wind spell.

Startled, I turned to see a female student approaching from a distance.

A calm smile accompanied her twin emerald braids and mysterious crimson
eyes.

‘She’s changed personalities again.’

It was Kaya the Ravenous.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Lv:** (140)

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant, Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Happy to see you.\]

“You’re already here. Sorry for being late, I thought I would get here
quick enough.”

“It’s alright, but what’s that in your hand?”

Kaya was holding onto a long object wrapped in a bundle, making it
difficult to discern what it was.

“Huhu, it’s a secret.”

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Excited to see your reaction to her
gift.\]

She had mentioned wanting to thank me further, so it seemed she had
brought along a gift.

Brushing it off, I casually made an affirmative noise before turning my
attention to the lake.

Kaya sat next to me on the stump, tightening her grip on the gift.

“I testified as you instructed me to the Truth Investigation Committee.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.”

As she had gone through the same thing as Ian, it was easy for her to
fabricate her statement.

She had her guard down and was knocked unconscious by a demon, before
Lisetta healed her.

That was how she explained the situation to the Truth Investigation
Committee.

If nothing significant occurred during the investigation, the Truth
Investigation Committee would have no reason to look further than Kaya’s
testimony.

“That’s a relief.”

“Did anything happen on your end? You rescued me, so I’m sure they asked
you a few questions as well.”

“It wasn’t anything important, especially since they think I’m also a
victim. By the way, how much do you remember?”

Squinting into the sky, Kaya started combing through her memories.

“When I was taken by the demon… I remember the blood in my body
accelerating. My body felt really hot… the pressure made me feel as if
my arteries would burst.”

Extending one of her arms, Kaya looked at the back of her hand before
replying.

The sun was gradually setting.

“Then, I lost consciousness. It felt like I was drowning in a deep pool
of blood…? I don’t remember anything else besides that.”

She seemed to be recalling her fight with me and her awakening as a
blood wizard and demon. Those memories were likely lost when she
returned to being human.

“When I came to, I was on your back.”

I already knew from the original story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

She would have lost consciousness soon after.

“I… was really happy that Sir Isaac came to save me.”

Kaya smiled brightly at me.

“The next time I woke up, I was lying on a bed when Sir Isaac lewdly
stroked my cheek. To think that you’d take advantage of me like that,
you had quite the evil intentions\~”

“…I didn’t intend for anything like that.”

“What do you mean ‘like that’? I want you to be more specific.”

Kaya tilted her head playfully, flashing a mischievous smile that
resembled Dorothy’s. However, her smile was a little bit more
inappropriate.

‘She sure knows how to confuse me….’

***I should hurry and change the subject.***

“You know you’ve changed, right?”

“Yes… I can feel it quite often, including right now. It’s probably
because I was being controlled by a demon, right?”

Kaya mentioned that she felt exhilarated whenever she transformed into
Dark Kaya.

She would feel inexplicably confident, and there would be no trace of
her usual embarrassment.

Her head would buzz constantly, as if she were traversing a detailed
dream.

Afterwards, Kaya would ignore any logic or memories, acting solely on
her emotions, and becoming a different version of herself.

As a result, she becomes overly honest with her feelings, unreservedly
expressing her affection for me.

“Well, it’s not all that bad. I can wield new magic, and Sir Isaac is
even cooler to me now.”

While blushing, Kaya stared at me intently. Her gaze was burdensome and
filled with desire, something that should be aimed towards one’s
beloved.

Intentionally avoiding her gaze, I silently stared at the lake. The
sparkling blue light scattered across the water grew increasingly vivid
as the forest turned darker.

“Today, I wanted to explain something.”

“Explain something…?”

When I lightly spoke in my usual manner, Kaya seemed to feel a sense of
incongruity. I’ve been speaking like that since earlier.

I had tried to avoid speaking kindly to Kaya.

It was mainly because I didn’t know what would happen if my true
identity was revealed.

By pretending to be strong, on top of acting like I had middle school
syndrome, I had intended to keep my distance from her.

But I didn’t want to anymore.

I knew how Kaya felt, and her alternate self was expressing that
affection without hesitation.

If I were to continue acting like this even while knowing how she felt,
it would be like trampling on her feelings.

Since we had the opportunity to be alone, I wanted to be honest with
her.

“I’ve been acting a bit mean to you, but to be honest, it was quite
uncomfortable for me. Was it strange for you too?”

I was cringing inwardly.

“…??”

Kaya didn’t seem to understand what I was saying.

“Sorry that I’ve been a bit guarded. From now on, I’ll be more relaxed
with you, so please understand.”

It should be fine to loosen my grip on our relationship.

I wasn’t prepared to dismantle Kaya’s misconception that I was strong
yet, as that would destroy our relationship. I didn’t have any idea how
I would explain that, anyway.

“I have a goal I need to accomplish by our third year. Until then, I
can’t think about anything else.”

Even if Dorothy, my favorite character, were to confess, I wouldn’t be
able to accept her feelings right now.

Back when I was a student focusing on my exams, dating problems were an
obvious enemy of exam-taking. It had the power to violently shake a
person’s heart.

In particular, magical training required a great deal of concentration,
as it was closely linked to the theory. Here, romance would be
especially disruptive.

Hence, I decided to prevent and postpone any romantic developments in
advance, until I defeated the Evil God.

By revealing a small part of my secret, I planned on making it clear to
Kaya that I wouldn’t be returning her feelings.

‘You’re ridiculously beautiful, but my current situation won’t let me
return your feelings.’

That was how I planned on handling the situation.

I continued to speak.

“So I hope you’ll understand—”

Suddenly, Kaya stood up.

Chu─!

“…!”

I felt a moist sensation on my cheek, along with an adorable sound.

Recalling what happened during the summer vacation, I turned to face
Kaya.

She had already made her way to me, leaning in my direction with a
casual smile.

Even the enchanting blue light of the lake was unable to conceal the
vivid crimson in her eyes.

“I’ve wondered about this before.”

While pressing down on my shoulders with both hands, Kaya placed her
knee between my legs.

She stared at me.

There was no escape.

“Why would someone like Sir Isaac come to the Academy?”

I could smell a subtle yet alluring scent, accompanied by the feel of
her warm breath on my forehead.

“It’s probably because of the demons. But why would someone like you
have a ‘goal’? Is it a goal so ambitious that you can’t even ‘spare a
moment to pay attention to someone else’?”

Kaya giggled.

“By any chance, Sir Isaac, will a powerful demon emerge during our third
year? Have you been planning all this time to defeat that demon? That’s
the reason you entered the academy… Or something like that?”

Kaya’s accurate deduction stopped me in my tracks.

“…You have quite the imagination.”

I calmly replied, making sure not to reveal even the slightest reaction.

“What kind of reason would that be? If a strong demon was going to
appear in our third year, I would have told someone else about it.”

“You knew nobody else would believe it, and only you realized. Your
abilities are far beyond my imagination.”

The resurrection of the Evil God.

It wasn’t entirely incorrect to say that only I knew.

However, my knowledge was limited to what was written in the ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

There was no way a weakling like me could recognize that the Evil God
would be resurrected.

As I tried to explain myself, Kaya giggled before interrupting me.

“What you’re saying is that you have no plans of ‘dating’ until you
complete your ‘goal’, right?”

A sense of unease traveled down my spine.

It was the same feeling I had every time Luce acted suspiciously.

I hurriedly read Kaya’s current thoughts by using \[Psychological
Insight\].

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Attempting to seduce you without
holding back.\]

‘Huh…?’

Her thoughts were very different from what I expected…?

I had anticipated her acting like she was in a drama, asking, ‘If I
still feel the same way during our third year, will you accept my
feelings then?’

I had even expected her to exclaim angrily, asking me, ‘Do you just not
have feelings for me? I’d rather you be honest, I hate this…!’ Or
something along those lines.

‘Did I just loosen Kaya’s restraints…?’

Regardless, Isaac was not in a position to date anyone.

So, she could continually seduce him until he liked her.

Ultimately, when he decided to pursue a relationship, she would make him
hers.

This was likely how Kaya had arrived at her current conclusion.

“…I hope you don’t misunderstand me.”

“Don’t worry. I understood completely.”

After Kaya giggled to herself, she grabbed the long object that had been
left at the base of the stump.

“Sir Isaac, did you know about this?”

Kaya began gently caressing the wrapped object as she spoke.

“In the Masop Forest, the Rompa tribe has a tradition of offering
choices when giving gifts to their tribemates, allowing them to choose
the gift they prefer. Whether it’s a rock or the skin of an animal…”

After staring in my direction, Kaya smiled brightly.

“Thank you for saving me. If Sir Isaac wasn’t there, I probably wouldn’t
be alive. Huhu, I prepared two gifts, so please choose one.”

It was a wooden staff.

The gemstone at its tip had a blend of deep blue and sunset hues. It was
an awe-inspiring sight.

Kaya passed the object to me with both hands.

“‘Zhonya’s Staff’ is a magical weapon that we’ve kept in our safe. You
don’t have to worry about it being valuable, since I use it myself. I
brought it because I was planning on using a staff…but I think it suits
Sir Isaac much better.

My mouth started watering, but I quickly suppressed my urges.

A magical weapon was quite tempting.

A suitable magical weapon would require a significant amount of gel to
purchase, and the Frostscythe I currently had in my possession couldn’t
even be used properly…So a magical weapon was perfect.

Not to mention, it was Zhonya’s Staff…! I couldn’t remember if it was a
tier 2 or 3 weapon, but it was definitely a rare item worthy of being
guarded in the Astrean family’s coffers.

‘I wasn’t planning on receiving a gift in return…’

At this point, my thoughts shifted. Her sincerity was impossible to
ignore, leaving me no choice but to accept the gift.

My hand naturally moved towards the staff that Kaya was offering.

Suddenly, she withdrew it behind her.

“There is another choice.”

Kaya held onto the staff with one hand, while simultaneously lifting her
skirt slightly with the other.

Her flawless skin shone, showcasing her beautiful features as she smiled
mischievously.

“The second choice is me.”

I stopped.

“Which do you want more, Sir Isaac?”

With a voice full of charm, Kaya mischievously asked.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Hopes that you will return her
feelings.\]

The humid air of Norhan Lake filled my lungs as the cool night air
started sneaking underneath my clothes.

For a long time, we stared into each other’s eyes.

“Haa.”

Letting out a sigh, I approached Kaya.

As I was seemingly about to embrace her,

“Ah!?”

I took Zhonya’s Staff from her arms and moved away.

“I’ll use it well. Thanks.”

“…”

Shadows covered Kaya’s eyes as she glared at me for the first time
today, her face contorted in disappointment.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t desperate enough for romance to succumb to her
pitiful advances.

Chapter 74: - Back Story - Hunting Evaluation (2.5)
===================================================

**༺ Back Story – Hunting Evaluation (2.5) ༻**

※ This takes place after the events of Part (2) and before Part (3) of
the Hunting Evaluation.

Elt Island.

In the midst of the Hunting Evaluation, I was about halfway through
after I defeated Rose Red Rivera

Before long, I found myself within the marshlands. Crossing it would be
a daunting task due to the watery mire that formed a large lake.

I could build a bridge with ice or rock magic.

However, the marshlands were likely to harbor demonic illusions and
enemy familiars. I could use elemental magic to get across somehow, but
if these creatures were to ambush me mid-way through, I’d be at a
significant disadvantage.

‘I might be better off turning back.’

I shifted my foot to the side, contemplating an alternative route.

And then it happened.

*Puuuuuuuu—!*

“Whoa!”

Without warning, the swamp surged up!

Sailing through the air amidst the splattering mud was a reptilian magic
beast, its size akin to that of two grown men combined. Cloaked in water
mana, it was the swamp-dwelling crocodile familiar, Dove.

\[Dove\] **Lv:** 60

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Water

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Wants to defeat you and earn praise from its master.\]

It opened its mouth, baring its menacingly sharp teeth.

\[Gahhhhh!\]

Deploying a blue magic circle, the crocodile magic beast tried to leap
toward me. Perhaps hidden within the swamp, it had gone unnoticed by
Hilde.

I hastily clasped my fingers together and condensed ice mana. The magic
circle of \[Frost Explosion\] conjured in front of my hands.

「Cascade (Water Element, ★3)」

As the crocodile beast unleashed a large amount of water with its magic
circle, I detonated the condensed ice mana toward him.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kwaaaahhhh—!!*

The powerful shock from the explosion of frost engulfed both the
crocodile and his \[Cascade\] spell.

In an instant, the spreading frost enveloped the crocodile magic beast,
swallowing him and causing him to soar onto the trees.

*Kuuuuu──!*

The elongated ice chunks that had frozen the crocodile familiar fell
into the marshland and transformed into a robust bridge-like structure.
The solid block of ice, condensed by mana, didn’t crack in the
slightest.

It was significantly longer compared to the one I had created during the
first semester. Clearly, my mastery over \[Frost Explosion\] had greatly
improved.

I resisted the urge to cross immediately. As I said before, if enemies
swooped down on me while I was crossing the ice bridge, I’d be doomed.

\[Master, another magic beast is approaching.\]

\[Kyuuuuuu—\]

*Drrrrrrrrrr—*

A magic beast covered in rock-like armor rolled toward me with a
crouched posture. It was an armadillo familiar with a body that could
easily measure around 2 meters when stretched out in its rolled form.

It must have heard the sound of magic being cast and the sound of ice
chunks falling into the marshland.

\[Arivori\] **Lv:** 56

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Wants to defeat you and be petted by its master.\]
「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

Gently extending my arm upwards, I conjured an \[Ice Spear\] above my
head.

I aimed it at Arivori, the armadillo familiar that was rolling towards
me. The moment I was about to fire the \[Ice Spear\] —

「Thunderbolt (Lightning Element, ★4)」

*Kwaaang─!!*

“…!”

A bolt of purple lightning pierced through the gaps in the foliage and
struck Arivori. The powerful thunderbolt paralyzed its entire body, and
its rock armor was lightly shattered.

Arivori didn’t have time to scream before it lost consciousness, its
four legs sprawled out. Only its feet twitch intermittently.

Purple electricity began to crackle in the aftermath of the
\[Thunderbolt\].

‘What is this, another…?’

\[Master, something dangerous is coming!\]

Upon Hilde’s urgent warning, I felt a sinking feeling spread through my
chest.

***Why, why? What’s going on again?!***

────── \[Kiaaaaaah!\]

Suddenly, the familiar screech of a bird of prey echoed throughout the
jungle.

“Ugh!”

Through the trees, a black bird enveloped in purple lightning swooped
down and landed in front of Arivori, the armadillo familiar. Electric
currents and gusts of wind spread in all directions.

Well, that certainly caught me off guard…

“Galia…?”

Before me stood a black grouse, ‘Thunderbird Galia’. He was smaller than
usual

\[Thunderbird Galia\] **Lv:** (100)

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Delighted to see you.\]

“Isaac, I found you.”

A rose-golden-haired female student was perched on Galia’s back. She was
Luce Eltania, the first year top seat of the Magic Department.

“Luce?”

Galia hunched his head down to the ground, and Luce slid down his nape
and onto the ground.

A gentle smile adorned her face.

***Thank goodness… I was scared when that \[Thunderbolt\] struck.***

A sense of relief washed over me. If it was Luce, she would definitely
be on my side.

“Hey, how did you manage to find me? That’s amazing…!”

I intended to approach Luce with a smiling face and greet her, but I
stopped abruptly.

Somehow, her condition seemed off.

Flushed cheeks. Breath so hot and ragged that it produced visible puffs
of air. A seductive smile.

Almost as if… she was excited.

A chill ran down my spine. It reminded me of the Luce from Extra Bad
Ending N.13, 「The Birdcage」, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 151

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** ?

**Psychology:** \[Wants to be with youWants to be with youWants to be
with youWants to be with youWants to be with youWants to be with
youWants to be with youWants to be with youWants to be with youWants to
be with you…\]

A shiver ran down my spine, and I quickly closed Luce’s status window.

‘What’s this? What’s…?’

***What’s with this sudden emotional outburst?***

When I saw her at the academy’s dock, she wasn’t any different from her
usual self…?

“I’ve been looking for you.”

Luce steadied her breath and began to slowly approach me.

“Whenever I saw someone use ice magic, I’d go and check it out. I
finally found you.”

Only when we were closer could I make out a faint emerald-green powder
faintly drift from Luce’s head.

‘Oh my god…’

How could I not recognize what that was?

It was a substance that oozed from those who had been struck by the
spores of the ‘Choro Mushroom’.

From what I remembered, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the choro mushroom
was primarily found in the highlands.

When a creature approached, it released spores that amplified the
emotions the person harbored.

For example, if you hate someone, you wouldn’t be able to overcome the
urge to harm them.

And if you harbor even a slight crush towards another, it could turn
into passionate love.

I remember it being described in the community as ‘becoming an easy
woman’.

After a certain period of time, those affected by the spores would fall
into a forced slumber.

In the process of completely detoxifying the effect, the person would
sleep as if they were dead. They would become completely defenseless and
would lose all memories associated with the effects of the choro
mushroom.

This meant that if you came across one, you had to run away as fast as
possible.

‘How much of the spores did Luce inhale?’

She had most likely inhaled a significant amount of the mushroom’s
spores.

For the record, the fumes wafting out were a natural part of the
detoxification process and weren’t toxic.

Anyway,

As I pondered over what Luce had said, I inferred how she had ended up
in this state.

She must have climbed to the highlands to find me. And with her keen
eyesight, she must have searched for my whereabouts from the cliff.

Even if the forest was filled with trees, Luce’s vision was monstrous
enough to track my movements through the gaps in the leaves.

During this time, the mushrooms clustered on the highlands would have
begun releasing their spores, causing Luce to inhale a considerable
amount of the spore.

Gradually, her emotions intensified, turning her into an easy woman.

Luce approached me as if she was about to embrace me and looked at me
with a smile one would use for their lover.

“I missed you, Isaac.”

“…!”

Her voice, as soft as moonlight, gently caressed my eardrums. Combined
with her warm breath, it transformed into a bewitching melody that had
the power to paralyze my senses.

A sensation of intense pleasure.

I froze like ice under its influence.

“This place is dangerous…. I’ll protect you from getting hurt, so stay
by my side, Isaac.”

No amount of ASMR could beat the sound of Luce’s voice. It felt as if
all my clothes had been stripped away and feathers were lightly
caressing my entire body—it was a shivering ecstasy.

***No, snap out of it.***

I barely managed to regain my composure and began to think.

‘If I had Luce, it’d feel like I’ve got an entire army on my side.’

With Luce as an ally, the difficulty of 「Act 4, Chapter 2, Food
Chain」would drastically drop. It would be a great advantage for me.

I had originally planned to recruit an ally at this point, as I knew I’d
be facing tougher enemies going forward.

However, I was afraid of Luce’s habits as an easy woman.

Perhaps due to the fact that I was lost in thought without offering her
a response, Luce’s expression grew cold.

“Do you… do you dislike being around me?”

Luce discreetly moved her right hand behind her back.

***I don’t know what she’s reaching for, but a strong sense of unease is
hitting me like a battering ram.***

In a panic, I hastily summoned my inner actor, the seasoned Isaac. I put
on my best acting face, flashed a natural smile, and reassured Luce.

“I was just overwhelmed with joy for a moment. Why would I, hate being
around you, does that even make sense?”

“…”

Luce stared at me with seemingly emotionless eyes, unable to brush off
her suspicion.

“Thank you for coming, Luce. You’re my anchor.”

As soon as I added a warm comment, Luce’s expression began to soften.

*Brush-*

Luce discreetly slid something into her skirt’s waistband. Though she
muffled the sound as much as she could, I could still hear it distinctly
from being so close.

I had a strong feeling that the ‘easy woman’ Luce was a double-edged
sword due to her strong inclination to keep people she cherished by her
side and protect them.

She had been burdened by the guilt of being unable to protect the Great
Witch of Heaven’s Wrath and Hansel, shaping her current self.

However, when wielded skillfully, a double-edged sword could cut through
anything.

“Isaac, where were you going?”

“To the center. I heard it’s a sweet spot, so I wanted to check it out.
Can you take me there on the Thunderbird?”

Luce nodded with a smile.

I tried to read Luce’s psychology again, out of habit, but quickly shut
it down, feeling a shiver.

‘Well, that’s enough of that.’

***Preventing a bad ending is my top priority.***

I forced a smile and turned to walk with the double-edged easy woman.

And then it happened.

“…!”

Luce suddenly embraced me.

‘What the heck!’

I could feel the soft sensation and warmth of her chest against my own.

The smell of Luce’s erotic body odor and the faint grassy smell of the
fumes from the choro mushroom detoxification assaulted my sense of
smell.

I looked down at Luce in surprise.

“Haah, haah…”

She struggled to cling to my clothes. Her breath was labored, as if she
was suffering from a severe flu.

It seemed like the side effects of inhaling too many choro mushroom
spores had kicked in.

Her earlier moans and blushing were partly due to her deteriorated
physical state.

“Isaac… I’m having a bit of trouble maintaining my balance… I’m sorry. I
couldn’t increase Galia’s size either… I’m sorry I couldn’t give you a
ride…”

“…What are you apologizing for? You should rest here for a bit.”

Currently, it seemed impossible for Luce to increase Galia’s size with
her current mana control. There wasn’t enough space on Galia for both me
and Luce to ride…

Anyway, the fact that I was trying to rely on someone like her for help
made me feel guilty.

I held onto Luce’s shoulders and guided her to sit against a nearby
tree. Galia, even after being reduced to level 100 and shrunken, would
be able to protect Luce, allowing me to leave her behind without
concern.

And the side effects of the choro mushroom would disappear after a good
night’s sleep.

*Shove.*

But Luce pushed my arm away and shook her head.

“Stay with me, Isaac… I want to be with you. If I just catch my breath
for a moment, I’ll be fine again… And if I’m not, we can ride around on
the Galia…”

Luce gently stroked my sleeve, the same area that had been charred by
Rose’s magic earlier.

“I’ll protect you, Isaac… So please come see me more often. Don’t get
hurt like this…”

Luce clasped my wrist with the same slender hand that had been stroking
my sleeve.

“If you get hurt… It hurts me so much…” Her voice contained a hint of
tears.

The effect of choro mushroom was to amplify the emotions harbored by the
affected person.

Seeing Luce openly express her inner feelings as well as her
vulnerability, I froze in place. I felt as if a heavy iron weight was
being pressed down on my heart.

‘Is this a friend or a lover?’

Hidden beneath Luce’s usual language and bland remarks, there was
something that unexpectedly ambushed me to stop me in my tracks, as if
it were trying to freeze time.

I sighed and gently let go of Luce, startling her. I turned my back and
sat down, bending one knee and stretching my arms back.

“Get on.”

I said as I slightly turned my head.

Luce looked puzzled, her face showing that she didn’t understand what I
meant.

“You said you were coming with me, right? I’ll carry you.”

***How can my heart not melt from all the concern she’s showing me?***

If anything, I wanted Luce to stay by my side. After all, I couldn’t
hate her.

Plus, with her by my side, Galia could fight more comfortably.

“Hehe.”

Luce giggled playfully, and clung to my back without hesitation.

She wrapped her arms around my shoulders, and I grabbed onto her legs
and stood up.

“It’s not uncomfortable, is it?”

“No, it’s fine. Isaac. You won’t get tired, will you?”

“Don’t worry, I’m strong.”

Luce smirked.

“Galia, I’m going to take a shortcut, so back me up.”

\[Leave it to me.\]

Galia’s deep masculine voice echoed in my mind.

With that, I picked up Luce and set off. I trudged across the marshland,
stepping over the icebergs I had created.

I knew that since we had Galia, we would be safe.

“Isaac.”

“…!”

As soon as Luce’s voice rang in my ear, a shiver ran down my spine. Her
tone was like a sweet and seductive tactical weapon.

“What?” I replied emotionlessly.

“Your hands… are quite lewd,” Luce said with a faint smile.

She seemed to be referring to my hands that were supporting her legs.

…Come to think of it, that was true. It had been so long since I had
carried someone that I didn’t realize I didn’t need to grasp her thigh.
Somehow, the sensation felt enchanting. It was making me blush.

I slid my arms further under her knees. Luce giggled at the sight,
finding it amusing.

Thanks to Luce and Galia joining me, I didn’t have to do much. They
would take care of any demonic illusions or hostile familiars that might
attack.

‘Thank goodness, really.’

If I were alone, this would have been a challenging section where I
could be eliminated at any moment.

“*Sniff*. By the way, you don’t smell like Isaac today…?”

“That’s because I used an odor remover.”

“That’s a shame.”

There might be enemies who could track me by scent.

I masked my body odor with an odor remover I had purchased at an
unmanned shop.

“But Isaac, there’s something I’m curious about…”

“Yeah.”

“Can you give me some… relationship advice today as well?”

Luce’s voice started to fade as she began to doze off.

Relationship advice. I’d been giving her nothing but stereotypical
advice.

At first, when Luce first asked me to teach her how to be in a
relationship, I was stumped, but now it didn’t seem like a big deal.
Humans are adaptable creatures, after all.

“What is it? Tell me.” I asked absentmindedly.

“If I had a crush on someone, and they were carrying me… what should I
say?”

I stopped in my tracks. I involuntarily froze.

My head started to spin at her words.

***Am I supposed to interpret this as her confessing that she likes me?
But that wouldn’t make sense, right?***

“You… you like Greung, don’t you?”

“…”

“…Ah.”

I realized I had misspoken.

Maybe it was just because of the situation where I was carrying her that
such a question came to mind.

Asking, ‘You like Greung, don’t you?’ here could easily be interpreted
as, ‘Are you confessing your feelings to me right now?’ There was plenty
of room for that interpretation.

“I didn’t mean it that way…”

“I misunderstood. I’m sorry.”

I moved on again.

“Is there something Isaac needs to apologize for…?”

Luce buried her face in my shoulder. I could feel a feverish heat
through the fabric.

Even if the side effects of the choro mushroom would improve with some
sleep, I was deeply concerned about Luce’s condition right now.

I kept a close eye on Luce to make sure nothing was wrong with her.

“Then, Isaac. I have a favor to ask… Can you please tell me something?”

“What is it?”

*Kwagwang──!*

A demonic illusion popped out, but Galia killed it with a single
thunderbolt.

I quickened my pace along that path.

Luce breathed heavily for a moment, then managed to calm herself and
continued speaking.

“Tell me that Isaac is Greung… Please just say that…”

I expected it.

***Sorry, but that’s not going to work.***

***To be honest, I don’t trust Luce. At least until I defeat the Evil
God, I intend to keep her from obtaining as much confirmation as
possible.***

If she found out, it would increase the potential for a bad ending. It
was already hard enough to get stronger and focus on killing demons.

***So when I defeat the Evil God and no longer have to worry about
preventing bad endings…***

***…At that moment, I will reveal everything.***

Well, surely she won’t resort to torture by demanding, ‘Say you’re
Greung.’

***…Huh? She actually didn’t?***

“You’re so stubborn, seriously. Of course, I’m not. For you to do all of
this just means you must like me or something, right?”

I intentionally used a casual tone to block Luce’s line of questioning.

From Luce’s perspective, she couldn’t be fully certain unless she found
definite proof that I was Greung.

This psychological distance was just right.

Luce wasn’t in a position to freely pour out her emotions.

However, her next response was so unexpected, I found myself at a loss
for words.

“Maybe I do…”

Luce flashed a faint smile.

Her soft whisper resonated in my mind like a distant echo.

“Luce…?”

“…”

After that, Luce didn’t utter another word. I called her name
repeatedly, but to no avail.

Her body went limp. Soft breaths followed one after another, gently
seeping into my ear.

“Are you asleep?”

A bitter chuckle escaped my lips.

In the end, it seemed like Luce’s body had fallen into a state of forced
slumber to detoxify the effects of the choro mushroom.

*Beep──*

Luce’s bracelet signaled her elimination.

The exam bracelet continuously monitored the wearer’s physical condition
and signaled elimination when they became incapacitated. Luce’s was no
different.

I leaned Luce against a nearby tree. Galia, who had been providing
support, settled down next to me.

Luce was sound asleep. Her head was tilted to the side, and her silky
rose-gold hair dripped with rainwater.

***When she wakes up, she’ll have lost her memory.***

“Galia, you’ve done well. The proctor will come to take her away soon.
You’re eliminated along with your master, so just follow along.”

\[What are you going to do?\]

“I’ll go where I’m going. Thanks.”

I stretched my stiff shoulders, which had become sore from carrying
Luce.

“I’m off.”

\[I have something to tell you, though.\]

Galia gazed at me with his eyes crackling with lightning.

\[When do you plan to reveal your secret to this child?\]

It was a natural question considering that Galia viewed Luce as if she
were his own daughter.

“…By the way, thank you for keeping the secret. I’ll reveal it when the
time is right.”

\[Please don’t be late. This child, she really likes you a lot, you
know.\]

”…”

\[I also want to meet my grandchildren soon…\]

“I’m in a hurry, so I’ll go. See you next time.”

I quickened my pace as if running away, interrupting Galia’s unfiltered
words.

As if to warn me to be careful, Galia spread one of his wings and waved
at me. I waved my arm in return.

‘Cheer up.’

I took a deep breath to compose myself. From now on, challenging moments
awaited. I needed to avoid combat as much as possible to reach the
center.

***Let’s do this. I’ll prevent a bad ending, just like I’ve done until
now.***

I pushed through the dense forest toward the center.

Chapter 75: - Social Gathering (1)
==================================

**༺ Social Gathering (1) ༻**

“Sir Issac, are you an idiot?”

Kaya assaulted me with a displeased expression on her face.

She even suggested that if I chose her, Zhonya’s Staff would follow.

I couldn’t choose Kaya even as a joke. It would seem like I was taking
her feelings lightly.

Fortunately, Kaya’s expression quickly eased as if she were treating it
as a joke.

After some casual conversation, we parted ways.

Lastly, Kaya said, “You’ll probably think of me a lot before going to
sleep tonight,” and sent me off with a sinister smile.

‘This is awkward.’

As I walked back to my dorm, I became engrossed in thought.

Kaya’s affection was becoming overly aggressive, causing me problems.

I felt the need to establish a clear stance on how to treat her… in the
future.

As I expected, Kaya’s demeanor returned to normal the following day.

“I-I apologize for acting so presumptuous yesterdayyyy—-!”

As soon as Kaya saw me, her face flushed red, as if she were remembering
what had occurred yesterday, and screamed out an apology as she ran
away.

I couldn’t help but feel uncertain about when I would be able to have a
proper conversation with her.

It was now evening, and the hue of the setting sun was prevalent in the
sky.

After classes, I headed for the butterfly garden. Putting the issue of
Kaya aside, I wanted to test out Zhonya’s Staff.

It had been a while since I last visited the butterfly garden, and the
atmosphere was quite tranquil.

Only the sound of grass being swept in the autumn breeze could be heard.

It was a stark contrast to the bustling training grounds where many
students had gathered to train. I could feel a sense of relaxation wash
over me.

“Oh…”

When I caught sight of a female student leaning against a zelkova tree,
I couldn’t help but make an exclamation of admiration.

Her long, violet hair cascaded down her shoulders from beneath her navy
blue hat.

With both legs stretched out in front of her, she silently gazed into
the evening sky.

She was a second year student and my senior, Dorothy Heartnova.

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Level:** 181

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Rock, Starlight

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:\[★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆\]**

‘Keogh.’

***Is there an image more beautiful than this? No, Dorothy is just that
beautiful. Ahh big sis is so beautiful and good to me, I’m gonna die.***

I was currently discussing what had occurred on Elt Island with her,
assuring my story matched the one I had given to the Truth Investigation
Committee.

Dorothy advised me to refrain from such dangerous actions, but didn’t
forget to express her relief that I was safe. She still had her moments
of being a respectable senior.

Anyways, as I was admiring her goddess-like appearance, Dorothy’s gaze
focused on me.

Soon after, a bright smile blossomed on her face, akin to a flower in
full bloom.

“President!”

“Senior.”

We exchanged identical smiles as we responded to each other.

Dorothy suddenly got up, hopping towards me before leaning closer to my
face.

“Have you eaten–”

“Be my partner!”

Cutting off my words, Dorothy suddenly shouted a request at me.

‘Her partner? Oh, she’s talking about the social gathering.’

The scenario was currently moving towards 「Act 5 Scene 1: The Four
Constellations」.

To explain, excluding the student council, the four factions that were
involved in the Academy’s administrative policies were dubbed as the
Four Constellations. Each of them were named after a constellation that
existed in this world’s night sky.

Act 5 focused on our protagonist, Ian Fairytale, entering one of the
four factions, the ‘Blue Wolf’, where he found himself confused about
everything.

Originally, the final boss of this act should have been Heinkel the
Hoarder, but because I had already killed him, I couldn’t predict how
the story would unfold.

The four factions would gradually begin to recruit their members amongst
the freshmen.

But before that, they would host a social gathering, a large-scale party
that had become part of a tradition at the Märchen Academy.

At the social gathering, students interested in romance would attend in
pairs. It evoked similar romantic emotions to that of a cherry blossom
viewing event or a festival.

While attendance was open to anyone, to enter the party’s central area,
one must receive a separate ‘invitation’ from one of the four factions.
There, you could meet the key representatives of each faction.

‘Having a partner would be nice.’

In the ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the events afterward would unfold
differently depending on which heroine you chose as your partner. I
remembered it as a very enjoyable Act.

It seemed Dorothy wanted to take me to the party as her partner.

“You’re talking about the social gathering, right?”

“That’s right.”

“I’m touched.”

With shining eyes, I replied sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.

Dorothy had opened her heart to me, expressing her wish to take me to
the gathering as her partner.

If I were to express my current emotions with body language, not even a
backflip would be enough.

As if my response satisfied her, she giggled.

“Nihihihi, as expected of my fan, you’re so straightforward!”

“But I don’t think I’ll be able to go.”

“But why?!”

Dorothy responded immediately, looking clearly discontent. Her
expression hurt my heart.

“Because I have to train.”

I responded whilst shrugging, giving off the impression of someone who
chose to study in the library alone in the midst of a festival.

My desire to have fun with Dorothy was higher than even the Tower of
Babel. I also thought that it wouldn’t hurt if I were to take the
occasional break.

However, going with her would attract a lot of attention.

I had already attracted the attention of other 1st year students by
hanging out with Luce.

Moreover, this particular social gathering was a place where students
from all grades attended.

If I were to go with Dorothy, who was hailed as the Academy’s greatest
talent and someone who had received the blessings of Manhalla…

The eyes of every student in the Academy would gather upon me,

What was worse, the student council president, Alice Carroll, would also
be in attendance.

Therefore, it became necessary for me to avoid becoming Dorothy’s
partner and attending the social gathering.

Dorothy squinted her eyes, giving me an intense stare before letting out
a sigh. It was clear that she was annoyed by my response.

“Training fanatic. You’re no fun.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Never mind that, where’d you get that thing?”

Dorothy snuck a glance at the Zhonya’s Staff I was holding in my left
hand.

“I received it as a gift. For the time being, I plan on practicing with
it.”

“Hmm…”

Dorothy didn’t seem to have any interest in knowing who gave me the
gift. Maybe she thought it wasn’t an important detail.

Turning her back on me, she began walking toward the zelkova tree.

“I changed my mind. I don’t want to go to the gathering either.”

“Senior?”

“As a training fanatic, you’re no fun at all, President, but going to
the gathering without you would be even less fun.”

Letting out a grunt, Dorothy leaned against the zelkova tree as she
pulled a book out of her witch’s hat.

‘Who keeps something like that in their hat?’

Regardless, I had to continue with what I had planned.

Before practicing with Zhonya’s Staff, I decided to work on my rock
magic as I felt I could unlock a new skill today.

As I channeled my elemental mana, a rock spell began to take form.

Time passed.

\[Rock Elemental Spell \[Rock Wall (★4)\] has been unlocked!\] \[Rock
Elemental Spell \[Rock Avalanche (★4)\] has been unlocked!!\]

The small golem familiar I had summoned earlier, Eden, was celebrating
as he watched me use \[Rock Avalanche\].

Perhaps due to devouring high-quality rock mana on Elt Island, his
growth accelerated, as he had already reached level 85.

When I checked Eden’s status window, it now noted him as a ‘★4 familiar.
I was quite satisfied with his progress.

‘Ah, what’s his \[Synchronization\]?’

While avoiding Dorothy’s gaze, I cautiously scrolled through the status
window.

\[Familiars\] **Eden (Level: 85)**

**Grade:** ★4

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Rock

**Friendship:** 90

**Synchronization:** 75

**Mana Consumption for Summoning:** 350

“Oh, it went up a lot.”

If one’s \[Synchronization\] with their familiar was high, they would be
able to use some of their familiar’s abilities.

It was like a partial summoning. For example, a high synchronization
with an avian type familiar, would make one able to manifest its wings
on their body.

In the case of someone like Eden… it would allow me to make a rock fist.
Eden’s skill of attaching and detaching rocks from himself would likely
come into play.

Something like a rock armor might be useful, but it seemed to be
difficult to raise my mana manipulation to achieve something like that,
so I elected to move on.

Compared to just encasing one’s fist with rocks, making sure each
individual plate of armor fit one’s body exactly without affecting their
mobility would significantly increase the difficulty of mana
manipulation.

‘Next…’

I was now focused on my primary goal for today. I picked up Kaya’s gift,
which I had left aside for the moment, Zhonya’s Staff.

The sensation of gripping the staff was rather satisfying.

\[Zhonya’s Staff\] A rare magic weapon crafted from the Philosopher’s
Tree. Adorned with a gemstone infused with the natural essence of dawn.
It works especially well with the elements of water, ice, wind, and
rock.

Rank: Tier 2

I gazed at the staff quietly, its outward appearance suiting me
perfectly.

***Let’s try it.***

Extending the gemstone part of Zhonya’s Staff forward, I began to
channel my mana.

‘Now, I’ll cast magic… huh?’

For some reason, the mana I channeled into the staff seemed to be stuck,
becoming tangled like threads.

Magical weapons increased the power of one’s spells, but control over
one’s mana became increasingly difficult, which was why many students
struggled to use them.

I was now experiencing why.

***This is harder than I thought…***

“Ugh…”

\[Kyuu?\]

Grinding my teeth, I attempted to cast a spell using Zhonya’s Staff.

I barely managed to manifest the spell at the tip of the staff.

「Fr?t?fire (Ice Element, ★4?)」

*Hwaaa─!*

But all that appeared was a weak cold ember.

Turning on a gas stove would have been far more spectacular than this.

“Nyaha!!”

Behind me, I could hear a peculiar laughter.

As I turned, I could see Dorothy, who was still leaning against the
zelkova tree.

“Nyahahahaha-! Was that supposed to be a fart?”

Grabbing her belly, Dorothy continued to giggle gleefully.

While a wave of shame washed over me, I couldn’t help but admit to
myself how beautiful her laughing face was.

“Ah, what should I do with you. President, you’re so cute…”

Tears began to well up in Dorothy’s eyes, clearly greatly amused by the
sight.

I couldn’t help but admit that it really did look like a fart.

“I feel more motivated. Thank you for making fun of me, Senior.”

“Nihihihi, I’ll make fun of you as much as you want.”

\[Kyuu!\]

Eden also seemed prepared to make fun of me whenever I needed it.

“Well… What happened just now couldn’t be helped since I just started
practicing with the staff. Even if it’s as feeble as a fart right now,
the end result will be magnificent.”

“I wonder how long it’ll take before it becomes magnificent. Nihihi.”

Eden raised one arm in agreement with my words.

Truly, the only one on my side was Eden.

\*\*\*

‘I feel like I’m losing it…’

It was a pitch-black night.

Navigating the ground using Zhonya’s Staff, I headed toward Briggs Hall,
a middle-tier dorm.

In order to properly wield a magic weapon, you were required to go
through an intricate mana control process, which was quite taxing
mentally.

If I had to compare it to studying, it would be like reading a textbook
with hundreds of problems written in tiny characters, each requiring a
precise answer.

“Hmm?”

As I was about to enter Briggs Hall, I noticed the mana stone in my
mailbox emitting a faint blue light.

The fact that it was glowing meant something was inside my mailbox.

‘Did I have anything I should be receiving?’

***There shouldn’t be anything though.***

When I opened the mailbox and saw a letter addressed to me, I pulled it
out and held it up.

“…?”

My mind, already exhausted from wielding a magic weapon, became even
more confused.

On the bright red envelope, a red elephant, the symbol of one of the
Four Constellations that represented the ‘Red Elephant’ was engraved
onto it.

‘Why am I receiving this?’

This letter was an official invitation to the social gathering hosted by
the Four Constellations. This gave me the right to enter the central
area of the party.

It could also grant me the right to join the Red Elephant constellation.

「Act 5, Chapter 1, The Four Constellations」 of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ began with Ian Fairytale receiving an invitation.

These invitations were primarily sent to exceptional students or special
individuals like Ian, who possessed the light element.

This was all to increase the influence of their respective faction.

In other words, this invitation wasn’t meant for someone like me.

“…”

My intuition began to scream at me.

It felt like Act 5, which I had brushed off without much thought, was
entangling me in something very bad.

**You can rate this serieshere.**

<span id="0075_76_-_Social_Gathering_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 76: - Social Gathering (2)
==================================

**༺ Social Gathering (2) ༻**

“Isaac… He must absolutely be recruited.”

Within Märchen Academy, there were a total of five factions that could
influence how the Magic Department ran. Excluding the student council,
the remaining four were known as the Four Constellations, each of which
were fittingly named after a constellation.

The Black Tiger.

The Blue Wolf.

The Golden Eagle.

The Red Elephant.

The balance of power between the Four Constellations shifted based on
the results of the student council elections. Depending on which faction
the president originated from, the influence of that constellation would
grow.

For example, the student council president Alice Carroll was affiliated
with the Golden Eagle constellation, meaning they currently possessed
the greatest authority among the Four Constellations. Some members of
the Golden Eagle were also a part of the student council.

Since the constellation affiliated with the student council president
tended to monopolize power, the academy also granted a certain level of
authority to the other constellations. This allowed the other
constellations to keep the student council in check.

As a member of the student council, one could wield immense authority at
Märchen Academy. Moreover, it granted a tremendous amount of recognition
following one’s graduation from the academy.

To understand why Isaac received an invitation from the Four
Constellations, we have to go back a few days after the conclusion of
the Hunting Evaluation.

‘Elephas Hall’ occupied a corner of Märchen Academy. In front of the
courtyard, the sight of the spinning water wheel accompanied by the
blooming trees created a landscape reminiscent of an eastern nation.

In that place stood a towering wooden building. It served as the
headquarters of the Red Elephant constellation.

A red elephant that symbolized the organization was engraved on the
office walls.

Seated behind a desk in that office was a muscular man, accompanied by a
pair of female secretaries with lifeless eyes.

With his dark red hair and intimidating aura, it was hard to believe
that the man seated behind the desk was a student.

That man was the leader of the Red Elephant Constellation, ‘Malrog’.

A female student with glasses stood in front of him and stuttered as she
spoke.

“W-we absolutely must recruit him before the other constellations…!”

Eva Hielov, who gathered information for the Red Elephant faction,
appeared visibly tense.

It was a result of the pressure being evoked by Malrog, enhancing her
fear that stemmed from the first semester.

Soon, the Four Constellations would be able to recruit first year
students as members of their respective factions, causing an all-out war
to acquire new talent.

In the first semester, Eva had recommended individuals to be recruited
based on the information she had gathered, but she wasn’t able to utter
his name.

*— Keep what you’ve learned between us if possible. Otherwise, who knows
what Dorothy might do.*

The words of Dorothy’s white cat famiiar, Ella, echoed in her head, her
intuition recognizing it as a threat.

However, Eva had already made up her mind over the vacation.

“Isaac? Who is that?”

Malrog questioned in a commanding voice.

It was clear to an outside observer that he was looking down on her.

It wasn’t strange that Malrog had never heard Isaac’s name before.

Isaac was only the subject of rumors amongst the first years.

Very few amongst the second and third years had even heard of his name.

“He… is an irregular existence.”

A commoner that didn’t even have a last name. A man considered to be the
weakest of the weak.

However, he was no mere underachiever.

Luce Eltania, the overwhelming freshman top seat who was cold to
everyone she faced, showed favoritism to Isaac alone.

Furthermore, the second seat Kaya Astrean and third seat Ciel Carnedas
also sided with Isaac during the end-of-semester evaluation.

But the most surprising of all was that Dorothy Heartnova, the strongest
powerhouse within Märchen Academy, also had a close relationship with
Isaac.

Additionally, his growth was astonishing. Within just half a year, he
had risen from Grade E mana to Grade C+. It was an accomplishment nobody
would be able to deny. Now, nobody would be able to predict how much he
would grow.

For that reason, Eva confessed everything she knew to Malrog.

“…”

As Malrog listened to Eva’s confession, his eyebrows furrowed.

It was clear he was intrigued.

\* \* \*

“This is unexpected.”

\[What do you mean?\]

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 5, Chapter 1, Four Constellations」
would begin with Ian Fairytale receiving an invitation.

In \[Act 5, Chapter 1\], Ian would attend the social gathering.

In \[Act 5, Chapter 2\], he would befriend the disguised Leafa.

In \[Act 5, Chapter 3\], he would confront the Red Elephant faction as a
member of the Blue Wolf faction.

In \[Act 5, Chapter 4\], Heinkel the Hoarder would infiltrate the
gathering and fight against Ian.

Currently, \[Act 5, Chapter 1\] was about to begin.

Ian, alongside the player’s chosen heroine, would spend a romantic
evening at the social gathering, and face off against the Four
Constellations for the first time.

Each respective faction would then engage in psychological warfare in an
attempt to recruit Ian, who possessed the rare light element as their
own.

‘Although, where Ian goes has already been decided.’

Following the original scenario, he would choose the Blue Wolf faction.

This was because the leader of the Blue Wolf faction, ‘Ray Rasmorgan’,
was an all-rounder gifted in both swordsmanship and magic. Ian’s ideal.

Anyways.

At the central area of the social gathering, the Four Constellations
would host an event for the students who had received invitations.

Whenever the time came, they would roll a ball filled with treasure. As
students channeled their mana, the ball would roll in the direction
where the greatest concentration of mana could be felt.

It wasn’t that the treasure-containing ball had a will of its own. It
merely moved towards the student whose mana resonated best with the
treasure inside the ball.

From there, Ian would receive another treasure known as ‘Cherubim’s
Necklace.’, which amplified the power of his light magic.

The reason such an overpowered item was given as a reward at a mere
social gathering was simple.

While it may have seemed like nothing but a pretty trinket to others,
its true value had not yet been recognized.

This was because the light element had not appeared within the academy
until now, preventing others from grasping the true radiance of the
item.

If worn by a demon, it would transform into a ‘Fallen Angel’s Necklace’,
amplifying the demon’s abilities instead. Consequently, some clever
demons attempted to steal the necklace during the second semester.

Well, Cherubim’s Necklace was nothing more than a trinket for me, but
Ian absolutely needed this item. Therefore, I had to find a way to
smoothly give him the necklace without any variables arising.

It was night. I was currently at Briggs Hall viewing the contents of the
invitation sent to me by the Red Elephant faction, noting the fancy
decorations attached.

As I commented on the strange situation, Hilde questioned me about it.

She had transformed from a small orb of light to something that
resembled a flickering flame. Within its form, I could see her pale blue
eyes glisten.

Her transformation was likely due to my increase in mana.

“It seems like Eva Hielov sold me out.”

\[You must be talking about the Four Constellations you spoke of last
time.\]

The contents of the letter were filled to the brim with information on
‘Isaac’.

**You are a promising individual whose Mana Grade has risen from Grade E
to Grade C+ in only one semester. As well as someone who successfully
cast 5-star magic as a first year student.**

To you, who has reached such heights in this short period of time, I
offer you my respect…

‘What a load of nonsense.’

The Red Elephant faction only pursued their own interests. Even though
my rate of growth might be much faster than the other students, that
alone wasn’t a reason for them to send me an invitation.

‘I’m sure it was Eva who convinced them to recruit me.’

I knew each person responsible for gathering information amongst the
Four Constellations. For the Red Elephant faction, it was Eva Hielov.

‘The reason they sent me an invitation is probably because of Luce.’

While there had been some rumors circulating about Luce and I having a
certain relationship, it was nothing more than baseless gossip amongst
the first years.

Perhaps the Red Elephant faction believed that if they recruited me,
Luce would follow. Eva’s persuasion likely played a key role in that.

‘…Maybe she really would.’

The more I thought about it, the more I could imagine Luce following me…

In the original story, Luce didn’t join any faction, as it would
restrict her freedom.

She truly was exceptional.

“…”

I leaned back in my chair and deeply pondered the situation.

I had made a strong effort to keep a low profile, and I even planned to
skip the social gathering to focus on training. I just wanted to make
sure Ian had received Cherubim’s Necklace using \[Clairvoyance\].

There shouldn’t be any demons or variables during this part of the game.

Still, there was also no guarantee that the story would follow the
original…

‘I’m being too complacent.’

My goal was to prevent any and all bad endings, meaning I always had to
be focused on the progression of the main story.

Based on my knowledge of the game, I considered all possible variables
and potential outcomes.

From there, I thought about my potential courses of action. I had to be
as cautious as possible, yet also assume that the worst-case scenario
would happen.

Just when I had come up with a plan, Hilde asked me another question.

\[What are you planning to do now? I was under the impression that you
wanted to avoid drawing attention from the Four Constellations?\]

I had informed Hilde of many things regarding the academy. Although I
hadn’t expressly stated my ultimate goal of defeating the Evil God,
Hilde already knew many things about me.

“To start, I have to investigate to see if anything concerning is
happening. Since I have \[Clairvoyance\], I should easily be able to
discover anything significant, like their stronghold.”

I needed to see if Eva Hielov had stopped at just spreading my
information, or if any dangerous variables arose with the disappearances
of Heinkel the Hoarder and Leafa the Illusive.

***I need to investigate as much as possible before the start of the
social gathering.***

“I have to go borrow some formal clothing since they’ll be out of stock
if I wait too long.”

\[The formal wear of this age…! Ahem, I want to wear it too.\]

“…Sorry, I’ll get you some when you can actually manifest your true
form.”

\[…!\]

\[Frost Dragon Hilde\] **Psychology:** \[Excited for the day when she
can wear a beautiful dress.\]

Despite her current form resembling a flickering flame, I could see her
two eyes sparkling with excitement.

I didn’t understand why she was so excited over a dress, since her true
form should be that of a dragon.

Nonetheless, I decided to understand her feelings. After all, she was
still a girl. Later on, when she becomes a baby dragon, I should get her
an improved version of the dress.

Before the social gathering began, my investigation of the Four
Constellations was completed.

Naturally, I found out that the original story had already been
significantly distorted.

Chapter 77: - Social Gathering (3)
==================================

**༺ Social Gathering (3) ༻**

“Gahhh!! You’re weak!!”

No matter how late it was, Lisetta Lionheart felt unable to leave the
training grounds.

As she wielded her gem-studded Rock Bat, Lisetta continually cast rock
magic against demonic illusions. She had already defeated several
high-level illusions but remained unsatisfied.

Lisetta didn’t know how long she had been fighting for.

Drenched in sweat, she exhaled, giving her a brief moment of respite.

Suddenly, she cried out to herself, repeatedly blaming her own weakness.

“One more time!!”

The demonic illusions reappeared, taking the form of 5 minotaurs.
However, after a brief skirmish, all the illusions had been defeated.

Still, she wasn’t satisfied.

The rock magic that so many had praised her for until now, was a source
of great pride for her.

However, her magic now felt incredibly dull.

It was all because Isaac, who had accompanied her inside the body of the
underground giant, felt so much greater in comparison.

As Lisetta sank in the mud, she reflected on the strong sense of
dejection she had felt, accompanied by a sense of inferiority.

“Ha, I don’t feel better at all.”

Within the spacious dome-shaped arena, only Lisetta’s lamentation could
be heard.

Her ideal man was someone her own age who was stronger than her. That
was one of the reasons why she had chosen to attend Märchen Academy.

While it may seem that she had finally found such a man, he was far
beyond her.

All she wanted was a man who could defeat her after a long and fierce
fight.

The difference in strength between her and Isaac was so large that she
felt it could pierce the heavens.

It was as though he was from a completely different world.

Rather than curiosity, excitement, admiration, or affection, Lisetta
only felt fear and helplessness.

That line of thought inevitably led her to feel shame about her past.
Had she really been so full of herself? Did she really think she was
that strong? Was it so wrong for her to only look for potentially strong
partners?

“Maybe it would’ve been better if I had never met him.”

Lisetta closed her eyes and sighed.

This was something she had repeatedly thought about over the course of
the past few days.

In the pitch-black evening, Lisetta left the training grounds, noting
how eerily quiet the academy was.

As she lowered her head, she gazed at her own trembling hands.

Even if she continually trained for hundreds, even thousands of hours,
could she eventually reach Isaac?

Isaac, who effortlessly manipulated high-ranking familiars that
transcended her imagination and effortlessly cast powerful spells.

There was a long way to go, but she had no idea where to begin to
overcome this inferiority complex.

Lisetta walked forward, clenching her trembling hands into fists.

\*\*\*

Even a week later, the quiet autumn night remained vibrant.

It was now the eve of the social gathering hosted by the Four
Constellations.

The gathering would be hosted at ‘Palace Hall’.

Consisting of four separate buildings and a large tower, Palace Hall was
a venue reserved for special occasions and large-scale academic events.

With three of the buildings surrounding the fourth, it formed a unique
configuration.

The building in the center was the main party area where only students
who had received invitations to the Four Constellations could enter.

The party space in each building was magnificent in its own way, and
there was enough space to accommodate potentially every student in
Märchen Academy.

The orchestra played the strings of the vielle and rebec, and performed
on a long tromba marina. The sound of the plucked strings from a convex
medium-sized organ blended into the performance. Various instruments
filled the party atmosphere with a refreshing melody that was just right
for the occasion.

The students present were enjoying the food and music as they danced,
elegantly dressed in formal attire.

“Ha! Truly, this is a fitting occasion for me!”

At the luxurious heart of Palace Hall, dubbed Atla Hall, many of the top
students from various departments within the department were gathered.

This included the Magic Department, Knight Department, and Alchemy
Department.

Amongst the students was a vain noble noted for his blond hair, Tristan
Humphrey. He leaned on the railing of the second floor, raised his wine
glass, and cried out joyfully.

He laughed alongside the other top Class B students and toasted to each
other. They had also received an invitation from the Four
Constellations.

Nearby, Mateo Jordana, a male student with light brown hair briefly
glanced at them before returning his focus to his food.

As a commoner, it was rare for him to enjoy such luxurious food. It
would be a waste not to eat it.

Sat near him was a black-haired male student named Ian Fairytale, who
was engaged in a conversation while enjoying his meal.

Tristan’s vain ramblings had become a part of their daily lives.

“Oh…”

“Lady Kaya, I’ve heard of you, but I never imagined you’d be so
beautiful…”

Suddenly, Mateo heard the admiring voices of his fellow students. By
looking around, he could see that the focus of their admiration was a
female student of the Magic Department.

The one attracting their attention was a lovely freshman girl with
emerald green hair.

It was Kaya Astrean, the second seat of the Magic Department.

With her charming appearance and grace befitting a member of the Astrean
family, many of the male students continually looked on in awe.

‘Sir Isaac, I want to see you…’

Unfazed by their gazes, Kaya licked her lips.

Vibrant red eyes. She had taken on her dark personality.

‘I put so much effort into my outfit too.’

Kaya was dressed in a striking dark green dress, intentionally choosing
a short skirt that accentuated her legs.

She had intentionally chosen this revealing attire, determined to seduce
Isaac during this gathering.

Instead of her usual twin-tails, her hair was intricately braided in an
updo style.

Kaya also wore various luxurious accessories, which added to her noble
appearance.

Elsewhere, a beautiful girl was devouring a tomahawk steak in a way
unbefitting of her noble appearance.

She was wearing a yellow dress, and her orange hair was styled in a
ponytail.

It was Lisetta Lionheart.

‘Is that bastard not coming?’

Even though she was devouring her favorite meat, Lisetta’s mind was
elsewhere.

More specifically, she was thinking about Isaac. He, who was undoubtedly
stronger than anyone present, hadn’t revealed himself.

Well, he had his reasons for pretending to be weak, so it was possible
he hadn’t been invited. After all, he was a monster capable of hiding
his mana.

Lisetta thought to herself, chewing on her meat.

“Huhu. It’s nothing compared to the texture of a hundred-year-old pork
that has been frozen in the north, but it’s delicious enough.”

A girl with short pink hair, Keridna Whiteclark, was laughing softly as
she answered the question of her classmates on whether she liked the
food or not.

However, she didn’t let her true thoughts show.

When she first entered the social gathering, she worried that she might
run into Isaac.

However, it seemed he had failed to receive an invitation to Atla Hall.
Otherwise, he would already be here.

That thought brought a sense of peace to Keridna.

***Because Isaac is terrifying…!***

“Is the top seat not coming?”

Her interest shifted to the top seat within the Magic Department, Luce
Eltania. She was someone who definitely received an invitation from the
Four Constellations, yet she was nowhere to be found.

Although it was difficult for Keridna to have positive feelings
regarding Luce, she knew having a good relationship with her would be
beneficial for the future.

Despite being close to a sociopath and refusing to interact with anyone
but Isaac, Luce was an exceptional individual.

With the party being so lighthearted, today should have been the perfect
opportunity… but it seemed Luce had no interest in the gathering at all.

Such a shame.

Soon afterwards, the elegant arched doorway of the venue opened.

As Keridna reflexively looked over to the entrance, her face turned
pale.

The person who entered was a male student with tousled silver-blue hair.

It was Isaac.

As Isaac entered, his bangs were curled upwards, and his white suit
perfectly complimented his well-toned physique. Additionally, his
friendly demeanor seemed quite genuine.

The students of the Magic Department were taken quite aback, as they
didn’t understand how he was able to attend without being kicked out at
the entrance.

Students from other departments also snuck glances at Isaac, with the
female students taking sight of his charm.

Lisetta glared, Keridna’s eyes shook in fear, and Kaya’s eyes widened in
awe.

“…!”

*THUMP!*

Kaya’s heart almost stopped, the sensation making her want to vomit
blood.

The sight of the silver-blue-haired student passing through the doorway
wasn’t something Kaya could mentally handle, but she did her best to
endure it as she bit down on her lip.

‘Ah, Sir Isaac… have you decided to kill me…!? H-how can you be so
cooooool…!?’

Kaya couldn’t help but blush at Isaac’s appearance. She turned her head
to the side as she covered her cheeks with a sinister laugh.

***He’s so handsome…!***

In reality, there were several people in the room as handsome as Isaac,
but in Kaya’s eyes, he was the most handsome of all.

In Kaya’s eyes, he was exuding charm from head to toe.

The urge to wrap herself in wind magic and fly straight into Isaac’s
arms was overwhelming. However, she couldn’t do as she pleased.

‘Since Sir Isaac said to pretend not to know him….’

She had to restrain herself like how they had agreed upon before.

She wasn’t allowed to interfere with his actions.

“You. How did you get in here?”

“Hmm?”

At that moment, Tristan Humphrey approached Isaac with a displeased
expression.

It was clear he was unhappy at the fact that Isaac had been allowed into
the same Atla Hall as him.

“This isn’t a place for the likes of you. With your level of skill, you
shouldn’t have received an invitation from the Four Constellations.”

Kaya’s eyes darkened as she expressionlessly began walking towards
Tristan.

The sight of Tristan raising his voice at Sir Isaac was disgusting.

“No matter how strong you may have gotten, your mana is still pathetic.
How could you, who doesn’t have any remarkable abilities, have received
an invita-”

As Kaya contemplated sending Tristan flying with her wind magic, someone
placed their hand on his shoulder.

Tristan wore a confused expression as he turned to see who had
restrained him, but quickly gulped in terror.

It was Lisetta Lionheart.

“I don’t usually meddle in these matters.”

Lisetta approached Tristan and quietly whispered into his ear.

“But shut up and go away if you want to live.”

A single bead of sweat appeared on Lisetta’s forehead as she issued her
warning.

Lisetta felt a growing sense of foreboding as she watched Tristan taunt
Isaac, she was unable to remain still. Saying such things to him was
suicidal.

If an aspiring knight challenged their commander, their fellow knights
might feel a similar emotion.

It felt as though Lisetta was watching a similar situation unfold before
her.

The only difference was that Isaac was a true monster.

Lisetta believed it was her duty to save a fellow human, no matter how
little she cared about that person.

It was a reasonable decision considering Lisetta was unaware of what
Tristan had done to Isaac up until now.

“I’m off…!”

Lisetta swiftly separated herself from Tristan and ran off. She didn’t
want to be near Isaac any longer.

‘What was that…?’

Tristan’s mind became muddled.

Lisetta Lionheart, what that feisty woman had essentially said was to
stop immediately if he didn’t want to die.

Why in the world was she taking Isaac’s side?

Suddenly, Tristan recalled the class placement evaluation during the
first semester. Kaya Astrean, who was currently present, had also taken
Isaac’s side.

Even during the end-of-semester evaluation, Luce Eltania had protected
Isaac.

“…”

He didn’t know the reason.

However, one thing was for certain. A student from Class A who was far
stronger than him was siding with Isaac.

He was trying to catch a fish, but that fish was surrounded by predators
such as sharks and killers whales protecting it.

Tristan was engulfed with a sense of danger.

“I don’t know what Lisetta told you.”

Suddenly, Isaac began conversing with Tristan.

“But it’s been a while. Good to see you.”

After lightly tapping Tristan’s shoulder, he walked past him.

Tristan was left speechless.

Chapter 78: - Social Gathering (4)
==================================

**༺ Social Gathering (4) ༻**

‘Senior Dorothy, please be my partner.’

In the Palace Hall where the social gathering was taking place.

At the party venue of the third building, a certain female student was
sitting alone against the wall while sipping wine.

She had flowing purple hair and was dressed in an elegant purple dress.
Thanks to her asking her maid for assistance, her makeup was more
intricate than usual.

In the place where her usual witch hat sat, a pretty flower-shaped
hairpin was placed.

The girl was Dorothy Heartnova, the sophomore top seat of the Magic
Department.

She was spending her time in boredom.

All this while, she had been greeting her classmates, juniors and
seniors, while turning down invitations from male students with a smile
on her face.

While Dorothy sat there, sipping on sour wine for no apparent reason,
the students cast a curious side glance at her.

The dress Dorothy was currently wearing was something she had already
prepared for the social gathering since the vacation. She was looking
forward to attending the gathering with Isaac.

Though he ended up rejecting her invitation, she thought that there was
no need to feel bothered by it.

She thought that it was alright. As long as she was with him, it would
be okay. She would still be happy. It wasn’t like she couldn’t
understand his reasons. Her chest just felt a little numb.

But the evening before, Isaac asked Dorothy to be his partner, and she
was overjoyed by it.

*─ Ah?! Did you change your mind?*

*─ Yes. I’m sorry for changing my mind, Senior.*

*─ Don’t be, don’t be! Nihihi. President\~ It was hard refusing this big
sis’ offer after all\~?*

*─ Of course. I’m your biggest fan.*

*─ But what should I do? The shock of being rejected once hasn’t
completely subsided yet\~ If the President doesn’t escort me sincerely,
I don’t think the shock will go away\~*

*─ I’ll escort you, even if it costs my life.*

*─ I like your sense of duty! I love it!*

*─ But senior, there’s something I’d like to ask you.*

*─ …?*

However, it seemed Isaac couldn’t fully enjoy the gathering.

*─ Can you wait for me until 9 pm?*

*─ Huh? Why? 9 pm is late, isn’t it? You can’t enjoy the party much by
then…*

*─ I have a situation, and to be honest, I’m embarrassed to ask you to
be my partner.’*

*─ President?*

*─ But, if I were to go to the gathering anyway, I want to enjoy it with
you, Senior.*

Isaac was an interesting man.

Because he always showed his affection.

Pure unconditional affection. His feelings made her feel warm just by
seeing them.

However, occasionally, he would show a sense of concern towards her. The
emotion he displayed yesterday was a prime example.

“The President is so shameless. He just does whatever he wants.”

Dorothy grumbled with a pouty look, putting both her hands on her chin.

Slowly, she got a bit drunk, with her cheeks getting red.

“If you say that, how can I not wait…”

Even if Dorothy was hailed as the strongest powerhouse in Märchen
Academy.

To Isaac, she was a woman that he worried about.

That thought slightly pricked Dorothy’s pride, but she didn’t hate it.

\* \* \*

\[A demon has been detected nearby.\]

It took me a week to change my mind.

The thought of being able to predict the flow of the story and prevent
bad endings from the shadows was merely arrogance.

Unless I crossed that line, I had to be prepared for some noticeable
risk.

‘Because the scenario is already a mess.’

Heinkel the Hoarder and Leafa the Illusive, who were supposed to appear
in the second semester, died early.

The effect of their death brought an unexpected entity.

That was the ‘demon’ in this gathering.

They were one of the beings that I didn’t want to meet early on.

‘Ugh, I’m getting nervous.’

As my body trembled violently, I regulated my breath to calm myself
down.

The effect of the passive skill of \[Ice Sovereign\] had helped me a lot
in that regard.

***Now, calm down and get a grip. You can do this. Let’s do this.***

Soon enough, the students diverted their attention away from me and
Tristan and went back to enjoying the gathering. It seemed they were not
interested in the trivial troubles of students they didn’t know about.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Afraid of you.\]

I thought about thanking her, but Lisetta quickly looked away from me.
Based on her psychology, it would be best not to approach her now.

As we had discussed, Kaya acted as if she didn’t know me. As a result,
the other boys who had been staring at me began to lose interest in me.

‘Ugh, boys.’

As I remembered from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it seemed girls like
Kaya were getting a lot of attention from boys.

Although I could understand why they kept glaring at me, it wasn’t
pleasant to be so wary all the time.

‘If Luce were here, it would have been even more chaotic.’

Luce and Kaya. The presence of these two heroines must have driven the
male students crazy because of how beautiful they were. it wasn’t hard
to see why they became my favorite characters.

However, Luce didn’t attend the gathering.

*─ Isaac, are you going to the social gathering?*

*─ I’m thinking about it\~ What about you?’*

*─ It might be difficult for me. I want to be with Isaac regardless of
it… but I have an important appointment to attend.*

A few days ago, I had a conversation with Luce under a tree in the
corner of the garden. My goal was to check on the scenario.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, during a conversation with Luce.

If the player didn’t choose the cheesy option, ‘Be my partner. I want to
attend the party with you,’ she won’t go to the social gathering.

Today, she made an appointment with Eldork Magic Tower through Märchen
Academy. It was a benefit only the absolute top-ranked students could
get.

There were no magic towers that didn’t covet an exceptional talent like
Luce, so such an appointment would happen occasionally in the future.

Even with her aversion towards humans, she should still be able to
handle the official conversations with the Magic Tower somehow.

Someday, Luce would become an exalted Tower Master and carve her name
into history. I admired her for pursuing her goal.

Even Eva Hielov, the information broker, caught my attention.

Since it was recruitment time for the Four Constellations, there was no
need for information gatherers to hide their identities. Besides, no one
in Atla Hall would dislike a broker who could help them secure a
position in the Four Constellations.

Eventually, the orchestra stopped playing.

When telekinetic magic was cast on some of the glowing lamps, the party
venue became dim.

Not long after, only the glowing lamp on the stage, hidden behind a
curtain, started to emit bright light.

It was starting. The students fell silent and turned their gaze toward
the glowing stage.

Soon, jazz-like music began to play, and the curtains were lifted.

A well-dressed male student revealed himself on the stage.

He brushed his bangs back, but he couldn’t hide his cheerful expression.

He was holding a small microphone. It was the host of the party.

“Greetings, my juniors who are here by the invitation of the Four
Constellations. I am Luigi Camare, the host of the Atla Hall party!”

The host, Luigi Camare, bowed his head with a smile and the students
applauded.

“I won’t talk for long. As you all know, the Four Constellations, who
organized this event, are a powerful organization with influence over
the administration of Märchen Academy! It is also a qualification to
join in the student council election, and simply being part of the Four
Constellations is considered a great honor.”

Luigi continued.

“Especially for you, who are some of the most promising talents amongst
the first year students, the Four Constellations will be the wings that
help you soar higher than ever before!

Now, let’s welcome the heads of the Four Constellations. Please give
them a round of applause!”

The orchestra changed to play a majestic tune.

The glowing lamps began to illuminate the third-floor balcony.

From the passage, students who held power higher than the student
council began to walk out.

‘As expected.’

The faces that I anticipated appeared before my eyes.

“Head of the Black Tiger Constellation. ‘Erica Hellraud’!

Head of the Blue Wolf Constellation. ‘Ray Rasmorgan’!

Head of the Golden Eagle Constellation. ‘Brown Falkborough’!

Head of the Red Elephant Constellation…!”

‘Malrog the Envious’

\[Malrog the Envious\] **Lv:** 155

**Race:** (Human)

**Elements:** Dark, Rock

**Danger:** Highest

**Psychology:** \[Wants to steal the Cherubim’s Necklace and kill
everyone present.\]

Red sports hair and a stocky build, a fierce-looking man.

It was said that he became the new leader after a vote that was held
recently.

His preparation was so sloppy that it wouldn’t take long before his
identity was revealed.

Luigi introduced him as ‘Malrog Bryer’, but his last name was just a
pseudonym.

Malrog the Envious.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, he was a villain who appeared in the first
year of the second semester. He was the sworn brother to Leafa the
Illusive, and similarly, could turn himself into a human.

Leafa had told Malrog not to reveal his true form because it would
interfere with his plans.

However, due to Leafa being defeated during the first semester, Malrog
appeared early.

‘The demon who wishes to become human…’

The two demons, Leafa and Malrog had similar abilities, but there were
stark differences between them.

That was Malrog’s desire to become human.

Because of that, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Malrog tried to steal the
Cherubim’s Necklace from Ian.

With it, the demon’s power would be amplified, and his ability to
transform into a human would become complete.

When Cherubim’s Necklace appeared, Malrog’s eyes would light up.

Furthermore, he hated humans with promising futures. It was a mentality
that stemmed from the demons’ inherent bloodlust and simple jealousy.

Not only were they born into the human life he had desired, but they
even thrived among them, which enraged him.

In the scenario, Malrog revealed his true form in front of a gathering
of top students.

Perhaps he wanted to use me to lure Luce in, or he simply wanted to kill
her.

In other words, Malrog would go on a rampage here, where Cherubim’s
Necklace and the top students were gathered.

My goal was to stop him.

‘The problem is that he isn’t classified as a demon…’

The reason why he was one of the demons I didn’t want to meet early on
was because, as long as he remained in his human form, he would be
classified as a human.

This meant that until he showed his true form, the condition to activate
\[Hunter\] wouldn’t be fulfilled.

‘If only Dorothy could use her powers.’

Dorothy’s body was still bound by the curse.

Malrog was a natural-born demon. Dorothy’s presence here or her use of
magic against him, would only accelerate the curse.

I shouldn’t let her fight natural born demons until she safely passed
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 6, Floating Island」, the act where she
was supposed to lose her life.

Luigi gave a brief explanation of the heads of the Four Constellations.
Since I already knew them all, I didn’t need to hear it.

The four heads sat on their pre-planned seats.

After that, Luigi moved on to the next topic.

“And! I’m sure many of you have been waiting for this moment\~ Today,
right here! I would like to share with you the treasury owned by the
Four Constellations in the Märchen Academy treasure vault.”

Märchen Academy Treasure Vault. It was buried in a confidential area
only known to the headmistress Elena, and a very select few academy
staff.

The wagon containing those treasures was also secretly moved here.

“The treasure will choose the one who resonates with its mana as their
master. I will present the treasure to those they deem worthy!”

On the stage, next to Luigi, a man appeared pushing a luxurious wagon.
On it was filled with treasures that were neatly organized.

Next to them, there were transparent round cases with gold rims, neatly
arranged like egg trays.

However, the student’s eyes were fixed on the man who pulled the wagon,
not the wagon itself.

In contrast with the luxurious stage, he appeared out of place.

Tall. His body, elongated like a stretch dough, gave him an eerie
appearance.

His body was as limp as a jellyfish, and his skin was as pitch black as
the night.

His spiky white hair was a stark contrast to his skin color.

His dark purple gaze turned towards the host, Luigi, clearly revealing
his nonhuman appearance.

“Wh- what’s… that…?”

A student pointed at the monster that was pulling the wagon. His voice
and fingers were trembling.

The crowd was filled with confusion and fear about the monster’s
existence.

Somehow, Luigi continued speaking as if he was oblivious and didn’t
notice anything.

“We will hold the treasured event throughout the party, so please enjoy
them…!

「Hydro Cannon (Water Element, ★5)」

*Bang────!!*

In an instant, a blue magic circle was deployed, shooting out a
high-pressure water ball.

The spot where the host, Luigi, was standing was instantly engulfed by
it. Luigi was swept away by the spell, hit a wall, and fell to the
floor.

He lay on the floor, trembling and coughing out blood.

The orchestra, taken aback, stopped playing.

Silence filled the air. Not even a breath could be heard from anyone.

The situation was so sudden that the students struggled to wrap their
heads around it.

The creature that had sent Luigi flying now turned his head towards the
audience.

The man had a creepy smile that stretched from ear to ear.

His next words were…

\[Hello?\]

It was a very familiar voice.

<span id="0078_79_-_A_Game_of_Chicken_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 79: - A Game of Chicken (1)
===================================

**༺ A Game of Chicken (1) ༻**

The first demon I ever defeated, Trevion the Evil.

That bastard appeared.

“Kyaaah!”

“De-demons?!”

“Prepare for battle, now!”

Suddenly, a panic-struck female student let out a scream.

A cold sweat broke out among all the students as they roused their mana
and unsheathed their swords from their waist.

In response to this, a group of Trevion’s appeared from behind the
stage. As they lined up on the stage, their expressions exuded grotesque
smirks.

While the students appeared terrified, they showed no signs of backing
down or running away. As expected of top-ranking students, they were
prepared to fight.

The students from the Magic Department started first, preparing their
long-distance elemental spells to attack.

「Water Wall (Water Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Water (Water Element, ★5)」

= 「Abyssal Wall (Water Element)」

*Fwoosh———!!!*

The black water created by the mob of Trevion’s whirled violently as it
completely neutralized the students’ attacks.

\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[\[HelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHello?\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]

The Trevion mob continuously squirmed in a rapid manner as they repeated
their creepy greetings.

Their greetings rang in the students’ eardrums with no intention of
ending. It was enough to make anyone go mad.

“There is another demon!!”

“Block it!!”

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Ice (Ice Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Ice Spear (Ice Element)」

*Schwook-!*

*Schwook-!*

*Schwook-!*

In a flash, a demon in a royal blue outfit, ‘Pernicus the
Contemplative’, jumped out from behind the curtain and began throwing an
onslaught of black spears at the students.

\[Hm─, Hm─, Hm─, Hm─, Hm─, Hm─.\]

Pernicus breathed out sighs from his nostrils, the rhythm resembling a
song that no one in their right mind would ever want to hear.

The students combined their strength to block the numerous \[Black Ice
Spear\]’s with defensive spells.

However, because their defensive spells were easily neutralized, they
had to continue to expend their mana without rest, casting one spell
after the other.

\[Shaaaa──!\]

\[Ssseuuu──!\]

「Tidal Wave (Water Element, ★6)」 + 「Black Water (Water Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Wave (Water Element)」

*Fwoooo─────!!*

From out of absolutely nowhere, the shark demon, ‘Orpheus the
Submerged’, proceeded to drench the students with its water magic.

*Kwaang—-!!*

*Crash—-!*

*Kkeeuuu——!!*

A huge demon in the form of a humanoid queen ant, ‘Garzia the Hermit’,
broke through the outer wall and seemingly posed with threatening
splendor.

None of the students were impressed by this display. Instead, their pale
faces reflected fear as they trembled in its wake. Even as they shook
and trembled, they continued to cast one defensive spell after the
other.

\[Buong, Buong, Buong───♬\]

\[Buuu, Oong───♪ Buong───♪\]

Past the half-broken outer wall, thorn trees illuminated with a deep-red
sky could be seen.

In that glimpse behind, something stomped into the walls.

A herd of pink elephants walked on their hind legs in single file as if
they were carriages connected to a train.

They sang in an unknown language while dancing to their own beat. As if
they were some dance troupe, their weird choreography had no flaws and
only perfect synchronicity.

*Kwaaaang——!*

\[Buooooong────♬\]

Behind the disgustingly blinding performance of the elephant herd, an
even bigger red elephant followed.

The behemoth stood 10 meters tall, and the wall that was already broken
by Garzia was completely demolished by its entrance. Behind the demon,
the thorn trees and hell-like surroundings were further accentuated like
a sea of fire.

The head of the huge elephant was shaped like a red brain, its hips
swayed to the rhythm of samba. It was ‘Elphelt the Evanescent.’

All of this happened simultaneously within a short amount of time.

Before I knew it, Ian had fainted as if it was a given. His head has
blood spurting out but I currently couldn’t care less.

“This is one hell of a party…”

All the demons I had defeated in the past joined up like some sort of
tea party for a princess, creating a scene of chaos like no other.

The dark elemental magic of ‘Malrog the Envious’, \[Mad Banquet\].

It was an illusion spell that affected the minds of those within a
certain radius, causing previously encountered demons to emerge and
gradually consume the target’s psyche. If multiple subjects were
simultaneously affected by the magic, they would all share the same
illusion.

As a result, demons that manifested outside of the radius of the magic,
such as Vera the Summoner, Leafa the Illusive, and Heinkel the Hoarder
were not present in the illusion.

Anyway, since Elphelt joined the party, it was the end of this nightmare
regiment.

In these illusions, one was projected identically as themselves. The
students using elemental magic was enough evidence of this.
Additionally, just like when I played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the
\[Vs. Demon Combat Power\] buff was also amply applied.

Basically, all of this boiled down to one important detail for me.

***‘I’m the Demon-Limited Hunter.’*** \[The demons have been recognized
as enemies.\] \[The unique trait \[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[Your level
and stats are temporarily greatly enhanced!\] \[Your skill tree
temporarily becomes +10!\]

I swung my hand nonchalantly as I activated my rock magic. My target?
Towards the students that were struggling against the demons.

「Stone Barrier (Rock Element, ★6)」

The students all looked confused as light brown shields formed around
them. Like \[Frost Barrier\], this spell solely focused on protecting
the students while ignoring any other magic including my own.

As if they acknowledged the power of my spell, both the students and
demons were speechless as they looked towards me in unison.

“What is this? How is a spell like this possible…?”

“Isaac, you…?”

The exceedingly vain blond noble, Tristan Humphrey. Even he was
speechless, as his two eyes lost focus and his jaw dropped. He also
seemed to have realized the true meaning of my spell and was rightfully
stunned.

Similarly, Amy Holloway and all the other students present could not
hide their astonishment.

“Sir Isaac…?”

Kaya seemed surprised that I outed myself so willingly.

***Whatever, it doesn’t matter anyway.***

As soon as Malrog the Envious was taken care of, the memories that
occurred under the illusion spell would all be altered.

For reference, all the memories altered would randomly reflect the
subject’s mind so who knows how much chaos would result from this.
However, it shouldn’t be too dangerous to anyone.

‘Of course, if I escape this illusion first, it won’t affect me anyway.’

***I’m going to escape this illusion.***

And if I succeed in hunting Malrog, everyone aside from me wouldn’t
remember a thing..

But even so…

‘I don’t want to leave them in the middle of hell’

With a demon horde that huge, even Dark Kaya would be unable to
completely annihilate them. As such, the students would all die
miserably and this place would turn into a hellhole.

Even if they lost their memories, the scars of trauma would remain.
Therefore, I didn’t want to let these children go through such a
tragedy.

All the demons readied themselves as if it wasn’t time to care about any
other students.

It was a natural reaction considering I was the most dangerous enemy
right now.

‘Let’s end this quickly.’

I raised my right hand as I let my rock mana flow.

In the majestic Atla Hall filled with demons, a light brown magic circle
covered the entirety of the vast ceiling.

With wary faces, the demons looked up at my ominous mana.

I unleashed my magic onto them.

「Meteor Shower (Rock Element, ★6)」

*Rumbleeee─────────!!!!*

It was a relentless bombardment.

The spell I casted hurled light brown meteors and bombarded the demons
with astonishing speed.

No cracks could be seen in the onslaught of gold light. High-density
mana created a flood of meteors so strong that it obstructed everything.
It was as if the mana created a machine gun that shot endless meteors.

For the demons, there was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.

The meteors that approached the students were immediately absorbed by
the \[Stone Barrier\], thus making it ineffective.

The demons became an indescribable mess, every inch of their bodies were
destroyed beyond recognition by the deadly rocks.

With that, I stopped the shower of meteors.

\[Hughh—-….\]

\[Shaaa—-…\]

\[Sseeu…\]

\[Kkkieeuuu…\]

\[Kyaak…\]

The venue was drenched in the blood of demons.

The demons turned into grey dust, scattering through the air as the
venue remained its clean color. The destroyed surroundings such as the
outer wall, however, remained the same.

“What is this…?”

“There was such a monster among us…?”

The students’ voices trembled as they let out their admiration.

Honestly, it was a bit burdensome to see them stare at me with their
jaws on the floor.

‘I think it’s about time now.’

When I checked \[Psychological Insight\] earlier, the goal of Malrog
was, ‘obtaining Cherubim’s Necklace and killing every student present’.

I didn’t know whether he would run away or cause a massacre after
achieving his goal, but that wasn’t important.

‘I need to deal with him no matter what.’

Cherubim’s Necklace was the only item capable of fulfilling Malrog’s
wish. He would try to obtain it even if it meant risking his life.

As such, there was a high probability that he was going to the stage to
snatch Cherubim’s necklace while everyone was under the illusion.

He would not slaughter the students before getting the necklace. This
was because everyone under the influence of his illusion was connected
to his nervous system.

If he killed someone, he would only suffer unnecessarily. Therefore,
before he tries to kill us, he would definitely release his illusion
spell first. He did this in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ as well.

In essence, my plan was to crucially time when I escaped this illusory
world.

***If I release myself too soon and I’m too close to Malrog, I might
immediately get subdued.***

***If I escape too late and he obtains the necklace, all our lives are
forfeit.***

When his goal was achieved, it was obvious that he would slaughter
everyone here without hesitation.

\[Hel…? Lo…?\]

I intentionally left one Trevion alive. Of course, half of its body was
completely annihilated from the \[Meteor Shower\] anyway.

The only demon left now was that bastard. To maintain \[Hunter\], I
needed to have the intention to destroy it in my next attack, Of course,
that was my plan in the first place.

At the same time, I planned to use magic to break this illusion.

As I reached my right arm to the side, I instinctively grasped the
magical weapon deep within my body.

‘Frostscythe.’

As pale blue mana clumped together, a deep blue outline of a scythe
appeared in my hands.

I surrendered my body to the chill of the Frostscythe.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

I created a huge icicle above the Trevion that was desperately crawling
away.

At the same time, I raised Frostscythe and let it impale the floor.

The Frostscythe’s active skill was activated.

「Ice Sovereign’s Majesty (Ice Element, ★7)」

*Hwaaaaaak——!*

\[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\], a magic that repels any magic used on the
caster.

My body glowed with a pale blue light as it burst out completely.

*Hwooooo—!*

*Kkung—!!*

The icicle made by \[Ice Generation\] fell on the Trevion and impaled
it.

And in the glow that filled my view,

I closed my eyes in silence.

\* \* \*

A black magic circle big enough to engulf the entirety of Atla Hall was
present. It was because of the dark element spell, \[Mad Banquet\].

A black maze covered the entirety of the hall from the chandelier
hanging from a beautiful ceiling to the wide walls.

\[Mad Banquet\] was a spell that created a new ‘Illusory World’.

It was similar to \[Fictional Hell\] used by Leafa.

Outside the illusory world, mana could not even be perceived, so no one
knew what was going on.

The students stood like mannequins with lifeless eyes.

With a sporty red haircut, Malrog the Envious practically salivated as
he headed towards the stage.

Luigi, the host, and the ordinary male students who brought the
luxurious carts were all unconscious.

Malrog began to examine the treasures exhibited on these carts.

There, he found a necklace with an oval-shaped coin. Subtle magic was
engraved on the mysterious white gem embedded into the necklace. It was
Cherubim’s Necklace.

Malrog let out a wide smile as he reached out towards it.

It was then.

*———Rip.*

“Kkeuk!”

From his right eye, a sharp pain was paired with an eerie sound. Malrog
hurriedly pressed his right eye as he groaned in pain.

Blood dropped like tears.

Each target of the illusory magic was connected to various nerves all
around his entire body.

Therefore, this meant that someone was able to escape the \[Mad
Banquet\]. As if they couldn’t be bound by mere illusion magic, the
spell completely bounced off this existence.

‘How?!’

***How is this possible?***

Malrog wasn’t given enough time to contemplate this dilemma.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Crack—!*

“…!”

Suddenly a \[Rock Wall\] shot up onto the stage and blew the cart away
as various treasures flew into the air.

\[Kyuu!\]

Suddenly, a small golem familiar, Eden, appeared out of nowhere and
leapt towards Malrog.

Malrog was stunned.

Before he could react, Eden snatched the necklace while quickly putting
distance between him and Malrog. He then threw the necklace to someone
in one swift motion.

As the Cherubim’s Necklace traveled across the air, it curved before
landing in a man’s hand.

「Rock Prison (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Kudududu—!*

Malrog hastily casted \[Stone Prison\] in an attempt to capture Eden.

At that moment, Eden was unsummoned as he disappeared in an outline of
rock mana.

Intense killing intent oozed from Malrog. Wondering who would dare
interrupt him, he turned his gaze towards the man holding the necklace.
A deep sense of rage seethed within him.

In a dark corner where no light shone from any lamps.

A man with tousled silver-blue hair glared at him with his sharp eyes.
It was a stark contrast to the mild impression he had when he first
appeared.

In comparison, Malrog shone in the spotlight on top of the stage.

He glared at the silver-blue-haired man as if he killed his entire
family.

“Who the fuck are you, you bastard?”

It was a deep and resonant voice that suited his huge physique.

The silver-blue-haired man, Isaac, didn’t answer. He simply lifted the
arm that was holding the Cherubim’s Necklace.

*Clink—.*

The Cherubim’s Necklace appeared from under Isaac’s hand.

Next to it, a light brown magic circle was conjured. It was rock magic.

Malrog squinted his eyes.

“If you so much as breathe wrong, I’m going to destroy this,
understand?”

An icy voice echoed, slicing the air like a guillotine.

<span id="0079_80_-_A_Game_of_Chicken_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 80: - A Game of Chicken (2)
===================================

**༺ A Game of Chicken (2) ༻**

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ second year, first semester

Suddenly, a man named Malrog made his appearance as the head of the Red
Elephant, one of the Four Constellations.

The guy would come into direct conflict with Ian Fairytale. Someone
playing the game for the first time would only think that he was an
‘evil senior with a shitty personality.’

Then, they’d become puzzled after watching the members of the Red
Elephant turning into emotionless puppets. I’d been perplexed too. They
had all been affected by Malrog’s illusion magic.

Eventually, Malrog would reveal his identity with the use of \[Mad
Banquet\].

Then, Ian would invade the space that Malrog created and wage a bloody
battle with his life on the line. This very space, where both the
ceiling and the walls had become a part of a complex black labyrinth,
was Malrog’s aforementioned space.

Incidentally, invading Malrog’s space was easy. It was like Leafa the
Illusive’s \[Fictional Hell\]—you could enter freely, but it was
difficult to leave.

Moreover, since Divine Power, an ability of the light element, was able
to dispel the dark element, Ian’s swordsmanship was able to reveal
Malrog’s true form.

Malrog the Envious was able to take on a human form, but he was unable
to become fully human.

Ultimately, his true form was that of a demon. He would inadvertently
release his human transfiguration from time to time if he dropped his
guard.

Malrog’s wish was to become fully human. He wanted to integrate into
human society and share all kinds of emotions with other people.

He wished for this because he was lonely. This was also why he had
decided to be the sworn brother of Leafa.

He believed that playing house with humans while occasionally murdering
them or eating them for his pleasure would bring comfort to his empty
and lonely life.

His human transformation could become nearly perfect if he had the
Cherubim’s Necklace. Then, his transformation would almost never become
undone.

It would make him no different than any other human.

“…”

The bloodlust in Malrog’s eyes was as cold as ice.

Rock fragments had conjured around him and began to float about.

Malrog’s mana gushed over me like a gale and pressed against my skin. It
was utterly menacing.

A bead of cold sweat rolled down my cheek.

I’d gone ahead and set the mood to threaten him, but now I was
frantically trying to survive.

Malrog was currently classified as a human. Yet, his level was 155.

This meant that I wasn’t able to trigger the activation condition for
\[Hunter\].

Malrog would be forced to reveal his true form if he was hit by a light
element attack because it had the power to dispel the dark element,
unfortunately, Ian was currently lost in an illusion.

That was why I was trying to steal what Malrog wanted so I could stand
on a more equal ground against him, even if it was by a small amount

I would lose my life by even the slightest mistake.

My heart began racing like crazy, but it quickly calmed down once the
effects of my passive skill, \[Frozen Soul\], kicked in.

“I don’t know how you were able to escape my spell… but that belongs to
me. Hand it over.”

Malrog held out his hand.

His tone of voice was commanding and riddled with the prickly thorns of
malice.

There was blood oozing out from his right eye.

I was certain that his magic circuit for illusion magic had been
destroyed when \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\] had deflected his spell.

Meaning, he could no longer cast illusion spells.

“I don’t think so.”

I continued our war of nerves without backing down.

“You’re going to fight me with the measly amount of mana you have?”

“My measly amount of mana is still more than enough to destroy a single
necklace.”

“You hopeless fool.”

Malrog spat out with a sigh in his voice.

*Whoosh*─.

A light brown magic circle glowing with a blackish light started to form
above Malrog’s head.

Then, rocks began floating above his outstretched hand.

“Know your place.”

\[Malrog the Envious\] **Psychology:** \[Believes that if he tortures
you, you will surrender obediently.\]

***Wait, what the fuck?***

“If this is how things are going to end up anyway!!”

I freaked out as soon as I read Malrog’s psychology and raised my voice.

My voice clamored all across the venue.

“Then I might as well screw you over before I die.”

Privately, I became the veteran actor Isaac.

‘I’m clearly about to die anyway, so I’d rather make things harder for
you before I do’—the resolve was fake, but I pretended that it was real.

My voice would have been trembling if my passive skill, \[Frozen Soul\]
hadn’t been cooling down my emotions.

“…”

I guess it worked since Malrog’s magic circle began to grow dimmer.

\[Malrog the Envious\] **Psychology:** \[Nervous because he thinks
you’re capable of breaking the Cherubim’s Necklace.\]

“Tch,”

Malrog clicked his tongue in irritation.

He was probably thinking that he couldn’t risk the chance of the
Cherubim’s Necklace being destroyed because a human like me interfered.

After all, the necklace was the one and only item that could grant his
greatest wish.

“…What do you want?”

“Do you finally feel like taking?”

Malrog’s thick eyebrows arched as he glowered. Apparently, he wasn’t too
keen on my response.

Then again, I was the weakest of the weak as far as he was concerned. He
was probably furious that someone weak like me had managed to get under
his skin.

The air was unbearably heavy and a sense of tension engulfed the
surroundings.

I didn’t take my eyes off Malrog as I continued,

“Leave this place immediately without touching anyone here. If you do
that, I won’t break this necklace for now.”

Obviously, there was no way that he would ever accept anything that I
brought to the negotiation table, but all I had to do was stall for
time.

Malrog squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again while heaving a
sigh.

“That’s not even worth considering.”

He narrowed his eyes before continuing,

“If you don’t hand over the necklace right now…”

He extended an arm and pointed not at me but in a different direction.
The magic circle deployed over his head followed suit and also changed
directions.

He was pointing in the direction of a crowd of students who were
standing as still as mannequins.

“I’m going to kill them all.”

***Is that supposed to be a threat? You’re planning to kill everyone
anyway.***

On the surface, I probably looked like I wasn’t even the slightest bit
afraid of Malrog. But the truth was that I was absolutely terrified.

In any event, I probably didn’t look scared, so Malrog had likely
concluded that he simply had to provoke my guilty conscience instead.

This was a game of chicken.

We would continue racing toward one another until we finally crashed.
Both of us would suffer a lot of damage as a result.

Malrog had decided to continue advancing upon me even after taking the
risk that I might break the Cherubim’s Necklace into consideration.

“Everyone will die, all because of you.”

More importantly, Malrog probably couldn’t tolerate the idea of backing
down. His pride wouldn’t allow that.

I dryly gulped. The negotiation table had been flipped over far too
quickly.

I was cornered. I had nowhere to run.

Let’s say that Malrog really did kill someone just to test me.

What would happen if I held tight to the Cherubim’s Necklace and
continued to wage my war of nerves against him? Then, he would slaughter
the students one after another in order to put pressure on me.

And, though it likely wouldn’t come to this, what if I decided to
destroy the Cherubim’s Necklace?

Then, Malrog would immediately kill me and go on a rampage in a fit of
rage.

“Phew…”

I took a deep breath.

I never took my eyes off of Malrog. The bastard would probably notice my
plans the moment my eyes strayed from him.

‘Please… please.’

I could no longer afford to continue this war of nerves.

***This was a battlefield.***

Isn’t it about time…?!

\[Master, I have succeeded.\]

An elegant and beautiful female voice resounded in my head just then.

It was Hilde.

‘Finally!’

A grin spread over my mouth.

***I believed in you\~.***

“What are you laughing at…?”

「Radiant Wing Slash (Light Element, ★5)」

*Swooooooosh—————!!!*

Just then, a pure-white sword aura pierced through the air.

Malrog saw the sword aura coming from the side and quickly tried to
dodge, but—

*Clang——!!*

The sword aura slashed through his leg and scattered a rainbow-colored
refraction.

Malrog’s expression twisted. Light element attacks were the weakness of
demons. That would have probably been a fatal blow if it hit his body.

Malrog fell on his ass after losing an entire leg.

He looked alarmed as he turned around and stared at the black-haired man
who had sent the light element sword aura at him.

“I… found… you…!”

Ian Fairytale. The main character of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Ian was holding his sword, wrapped in light mana, tightly as he glared
back at Malrog. His eyes, however, showed no signs of life.

Well, that was probably because he was still trapped in Malrog’s
illusion. He had simply located the version of Malrog inside his
illusion.

“How did you even…? Huh?”

Malrog’s jaw dropped. He had spotted the necklace that was tinkling
around Ian’s, the Child of Light’s, neck.

As if it had found its rightful master, the Cherubim’s Necklace emitted
a white holy light from the magic circle engraved on it.

Ian had fainted during the \[Mad Banquet\], but the Cherubim’s Necklace
had awakened and amplified his Divine Power.

The fight against Malrog the Envious during the first semester of the
second year of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

The bastard was capable of using illusion magic freely. And Ian had
fought him and won all the same.

How had that been possible? It had all been thanks to Divine Power.

Though Ian probably would’ve been helpless against the \[Mad Banquet\],
a dark element illusion spell, had he been alone.

But Ian had been equipped with the Cherubim’s Necklace.

It was thanks to the necklace that his Divine Power had been amplified,
which in turn had allowed him to resist the world of the dark elemental
illusion. Not only did that make the world of the illusion begin to
fade, but it also allowed him to discern the image of the caster outside
of it.

As such, Ian was able to move his arms and legs.

And he could face Malrog the Envious while straddling the line between
reality and illusion.

‘Sorry, I pulled aggro to show you this.’

***Was this seriously the Cherubim’s Necklace’s buff?***

So, how was the Cherubim’s Necklace hanging around Ian’s neck you ask?
It was there because, fortunately, my plan had worked.

I was standing in a location where there were no lamps. And I had
purposefully stretched my arm back as I held out the necklace.

All so that Malrog would never figure out my strategy.

In conclusion, the necklace I was holding was not the Cherubim’s
Necklace.

It was just a counterfeit that I had prepared in advance.

‘I’m glad it worked out…’

I gently squeezed the counterfeit necklace I was holding again and
shrugged.

A few days before the gathering.

I’d sought out Eva Hielov, who had sold my information and grilled her.

After all, I had \[Psychology Insight\], so it was a simple matter for
me to read her deepest secrets and put some pressure on her.

To add insult to injury, Eva had sold my information to the Red
Elephant, and she was terrified of the backlash. It was easy to make
sure she wouldn’t say anything.

‘Eva the Lurker’ was a small-fry mob that appeared in \[Act 5, Chapter
3, Blue Wolf v.s. Red Elephant\] of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Eva used the \[Stealth\] spell. \[Stealth\] made it so that only a
minuscule amount of the caster’s mana leaked. That was why it was
difficult to sense Eva when she was using \[Stealth\] if you didn’t have
a very high mana perception.

‘Moreover, Eva is a character whose entire identity revolves around
\[Stealth\].’

Eva was unrivaled in sneakiness at Märchen Academy

She wasn’t that hard to deal with as a mob because she’d still get
caught in AoE spells anyway, but she had been incredibly useful in my
plan.

I had told Eva beforehand to go out to the hallway as soon as the Atla
Hall gathering had started and await further instructions from Hilde.

Then, once she was in the hallway, Hilde would blackmail her using the
script that I had prepared.

Hilde had probably also told her that it was safe to enter Malrog’s
space in order to convince her more effectively.

As a result, Eva had entered Malrog’s space, approached me in secret
while I was unconscious, and had been secretly waiting on standby.

Then, once I’d broken free of Malrog’s illusion magic and taken out the
counterfeit necklace…

Eden would take the real Cherubim’s Necklace and sneakily hand it over
to Eva, who was waiting behind me.

Eva’s \[Stealth\] made it impossible to perceive any objects that were
touching her body. This could be proved by how her glasses and the
clothes she was wearing also turned invisible.

The spell was limited in that it couldn’t conceal other living beings
that she was touching, but that didn’t really matter.

The Cherubim’s Necklace had immediately turned invisible as soon as Eva
touched it.

Then, she had snuck her way to where Ian Fairytale was. From there, she
had hung the Cherubim’s Necklace around his neck just as I had
instructed.

That was the reason why Ian had been able to resist Malrog’s illusion
magic.

On top of the stage. Beneath the spotlight.

Malrog was utterly baffled.

“What just…? A-argh…!”

Divine power was the ability to cast light upon the darkness. It forced
Malrog to revert to his original form.

Malrog’s eyes turned crimson. Black wings jetted out from his head.

His head quickly swelled up in size. His muscular body was swallowed by
his head. He looked like some kind of bizarre rock.

The host and the normal male students who had been pulling the wagon
were pushed off the stage.

One after another, dozens of human heads pierced through his skin and
began grinding their teeth.

\[Crunch, crunch—.\]

His eyelids audibly ripped open.

His crimson eyes grew to about 3 meters in diameter.

His useless black wings fluttered haplessly over his head.

His mouth had torn open all the way down to his chin, and a neat array
of teeth was barred for all to see. The bastard was grinding his teeth
without pause.

*Crunch crunch*, it echoed gruesomely. He was the demon who always
ground his teeth in envy and seethed in his inferiority complex—‘Malrog
the Envious’.

He had finally shown his true form.

\[Malrog the Envious\] **Lv:** 160

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Rock

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:**
\[Wantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyouwantstokillyou..\]

\[You’re just a weakling.

*Crunch*

You’re just a weak little bug!!

*Crunch*

And yet…

*Crunch*

You’ve angered me, you bastard.\]

*Crunch—. Crunch—.*

\[I’ll kill you.

*Crunch*

More painfully than anyone else.

*Crunch*

I’ll kill you—.\]

*Crunch—. Crunch—.*

\[I’ll stab skewers through your mouth,

*Crunch*

And I’ll use rocks

*Crunch*

to grind up your limbs.

*Crunch*

And even if you shudder with regret

*Crunch*

I will still kill you

More painfully than anyone else—.\]

*Crunch—. Crunch—.*

Malrog conjured a gigantic magic circle.

***This is the first time I’ve felt happy to see a demon’s hideous
form…***

“Hic!”

Eva, who was still under the effects of the \[Stealth\] spell, began
hiccupping from fright. ***Oh, so that’s where she was hiding.***

Anyway, it seemed like Malrog was displeased about the fact that someone
as weak as me had gotten under his skin.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[Your level and stats are temporarily
greatly enhanced!\] \[Your skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

‘Finally.’

***Well, I guess it’s time to show him the difference in our respective
strengths.***

I began to slowly walk up to Malrog as ice and rock mana began flowing
out from me.

<span id="0080_81_-_A_Game_of_Chicken_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 81: - A Game of Chicken (3)
===================================

**༺ A Game of Chicken (3) ༻**

A pebble on the side of the road.

That was what Eva Hielov, a low-ranking student of Class D, thought of
herself.

Although her talent for magic was above average in the Zelver Empire.

Her skills were miserable when compared to all the talents gathered in
Märchen Academy.

That was why, when the Red Elephant of the Four Constellations had
invited her to be their information gatherer…

She had resolved to offer the Red Elephant everything she had. She had
believed that this was the only way for her to prove her worth inside
Märchen Academy.

Unfortunately… it looked like she had made a terrible mistake.

Eva had a very low mana perception, but she could still feel it clearly.

The man named Isaac was overflowing with mana beyond her imagination…!

*‘I won’t overlook the fact that you sold information about me, Eva.’*

She recalled how he had spoken to her so solemnly.

***Just who had she just provoked? Who had she just offended?***

‘I’ll live quietly from now on without getting ahead of myself…’

She was overcome with terror and hopelessness. She wanted to cry.

Eva’s resolve to offer her everything to the Red Elephant had crumbled
long ago.

Now, even the crumbs of that shattered resolve were breaking away piece
by piece.

\* \* \*

\[What did you do? Crunch. Why is your mana suddenly…?!\]

Malrog’s massive eyes widened, growing even larger.

It was only natural for him to be surprised. Malrog may be strong, but I
still had significantly more mana than him.

I looked out of the corner of my eye. Ian was gathering light mana on
the blade of his sword.

A pure-white magic circle was conjuring around him. Was he planning on
using \[Apostle of Light\]?

Casting \[Apostle of Light\] in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱’s hell
difficulty originally required an extremely high level of control.

This was because the spell took a very long time to cast. The timing was
ambiguous, so you needed to be able to calculate it well.

In return, however, its performance was guaranteed.

‘Good.’

\[Apostle of Light\] was basically a prerequisite to complete \[Chapter
6, Floating Island\] of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I would have no way to save Dorothy if Ian didn’t use \[Apostle of
Light\] at the center of Floating Island.

So I wanted to take this opportunity to confirm with my own two eyes
that Ian was actually capable of properly casting this spell.

「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Rock (Rock Element,
★5)」

= 「Black Rock Hammer (Rock Element)」

*Rumbleeee———!!*

A giant black rock protruded out from Malrog’s magic circle like a
hammer.

The \[Black Rock Hammer\]. It was trying to crush me, Ian, and the rest
of the other students.

***‘I won’t be defeated so easily.’***

I raised my index finger and began casting a joint elemental spell.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 + 「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

= 「Fossilized Ice (Rock + Ice Element)」

*Craaaack——!!*

*Craaash——!!*

A saturated wall of ice fell upon Malrog and encased him as I moved my
finger.

A thick wall of ice that was gleaming with veins of light brown rock
mana—\[Fossilized Ice\].

It was the most powerful defensive spell that I could currently use.

Malrog’s \[Black Rock Hammer\] collided against my \[Fossilized Ice\],
but it couldn’t even leave a scratch on the sturdy wall of ice.

\[Crunch. Shit!!\]

Before long, Ian had finally finished prepping to cast \[Apostle of
Light\].

I dispelled the \[Fossilized Ice\] I had cast in order to defend against
Malrog’s \[Block Rock Hammer\]. Pale blue and light brown specks of
light floated down from the air.

Then, I shot out another \[Fossilized Ice\] to erupt where Malrog
lingered.

*Rumbleeee———!*

\[Ughhh!\]

Malrog’s frame was thrust upwards by my \[Fossilized Ice\] but stopped
ascending partway through.

\[Fossilized Ice\] spread out around him like a wall. I had purposefully
left the side where Ian was facing open.

***And now, the stage is set.***

Ian raised his sword, which was imbued with light mana, above his head.

Then, in one swift motion, he brought it down.

His sword drew a streak of pure-white light through the air.

White flames rose from the sword, piercing through the ground and racing
toward Malrog.

*Swooooosh———!!*

A pure white dove bursted out from the swing of Ian’s sword, and dozens
of rays of light were unleashed from his magic circle.

All of his attacks fell upon Malrog as one.

「Apostle of Light (Light Element, ★5)」

*Claaaang——!!*

*Flaaaaash———!!!*

Rainbow-colored light flared, and a storm of pure-white fire enclosed
Malrog and in a blinding flash of light, his body burned.

\[Fossilized Ice\] was preventing \[Apostle of Light\] from dispersing,
so the spell burned Malrog and Malrog alone.

Malrog gritted his teeth to endure the agony.

There might be a large difference in level between Ian and Malrog, but
Divine Power was still a demon’s weakness.

Moreover, Ian was a weapon that made it possible to face demons with a
large level difference. He was pretty effective.

Best of all, \[Apostle of Light\] came with a very useful effect.

\[Crunch. Ugh… My mana…!\]

The flames of \[Apostle of Light\] dwindled.

Malrog was scorched all over, and he was unable to use magic.

\[Apostle of Light\] temporarily tangled up the target’s mana circuit.

Malrog could probably still use simple spells like \[Rock Avalanche\].

But it would be difficult for him to use spells like \[Rock Rampage\],
which required a high degree of mana control.

\[Rock Rampage\] was one of the most dangerous skills in Malrog’s attack
pattern.

It was a large-scale spell that created indiscriminate eruptions of
rock. There would be a lot of casualties if that bastard used such a
spell.

Originally, if you wanted to neutralize Malrog before he had the chance
to cast \[Rock Rampage\], you had to use a light element sword aura to
attack only the glowing heads from among the many heads that were
attached all over his body.

***‘But how the hell would Ian manage that?’***

Well, there was nothing I could do about that. And so, the next best
alternative was to have him cast \[Apostle of Light\] on Malrog with my
support.

***Anyway, that was a good show. I won’t need to worry about the power
of \[Apostle of Light\].***

I defrosted \[Fossilized Ice\] as I walked towards Malrog. He ended up
floating in midair when the \[Fossilized Ice\] that had been holding up
his body disappeared.

Just before he began plummeting down to the stage due to the effects of
gravity…

His two gigantic eyes met mine.

\[Malrog the Envious\] **Psychology:** \[Terrified of you.\]

\[Crunch crunch. How, how?!!\]

Malrog cried in a trembling voice.

\[Crunch. Your mana was unmistakably crunch

No better than that of an insect’s!!\]

I stood under the shining spotlight and extended my right hand toward
Malrog.

Ice and rock mana flowed out from my right hand and two colossal magic
circles that were pale blue and light brown in color formed atop the
stage and over Malrog’s head.

***“I…”***

A faint smile tugged at the corners of my lips.

***“…Just so happen to be a bit overpowered when hunting bastards like
you.”***

Then, I clenched my right hand into a fist and casted my spell.

「Sink Hole (Rock Element, ★6)」 + 「Frost Wave (Ice Element, ★6)」

= 「Permafrost (Rock + Ice Element)」

*Crack————!!!*

*Crackleeeeee————!!!*

The magic circles above and below Malrog spat out cold rocks, clumps of
dirt, and gushes of frigid, cold air.

A deathly cold rock quickly bursted up from the stage.

Malrog’s body immediately became frostbitten as soon as the rock touched
him.

And then he was crushed haplessly by the soil and rock that was raining
down from above.

*Rumbleeee—————!!!*

The two boulders crushed him from above and below.

Malrog’s body was trapped inside the pale blue soil of the
\[Permafrost\], unable to escape

*Hsssssst——!!*

The two rocks swallowed Malrog and began emitting a steam-like chill
that was riddled with ice crystals.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 + 「Black Rock (Rock Element, ★5)」

= 「Indestructible Iron Body (Rock Element)」

\[Permafrost\] was a spell that trapped its target inside itself and
crushed them to death. Malrog, however, had avoided instant death by
casting \[Indestructible Iron Body\] at maximum output.

Unfortunately for him, it was to no avail.

*Crack—.*

\[Permafrost\] would continue to crush anything in its range regardless
of how durable it was. The pressure it generated was not something that
the likes of Malrog’s \[Indestructible Iron Body\] could handle.

The bastard’s \[Indestructible Iron Body\] was ravaged.

At long last. \[Permafrost\] was dispelled and the rocks emitting
frigid, pale blue chill ceased their activity. It turned into specks of
pale blue and light brown light as it disappeared.

The spell began to reveal a haplessly crushed-up black rock.

Inside the black rock was Malrog, whose body was smashed up and covered
in frozen blood. His body was so ruined that it was hard to recognize
his previous appearance.

\[Cr… unch…\]

Malrog began to fall under the influence of gravity.

He grinded his teeth one last time before hitting the stage.

***\[So… lonely…\]***

Malrog’s last words quietly faded into the distance.

And he turned into an ashen powder before scattering into the air.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Malrog the Envious (Lv
160)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 76!\]
\[You have gained 2 stat points!\] \[You have unlocked the achievement
❰The Qualification to be Human❱! You have gained an additional 15 stat
points!\]

My body became extremely heavy and my mana rapidly decreased as soon as
my unique trait \[Hunter\] was deactivated.

The black labyrinth that had filled the ceiling and walls slowly faded
away. Soon enough, the rest of the students would wake up from their
illusions, and their memories would be substituted with fake ones.

Ian was no exception.

In the game, he was supposed to have broken completely free of the
illusion and fought against Malrog.

This time, however, he was still under the illusion spell. So, his
memories would probably be altered as well.

But more importantly.

*Pop, pop─.*

Malrog the Envious vanished completely, leaving behind a lone key that
bounced before settling on the stage..

I climbed up to the stage and picked up the key. It was old and silver.

\[You have obtained the loot \[Key to Mysteries\]!\]

*‘I’ll take this.’*

***I didn’t think I’d get this so soon…***

I pocketed the ‘Key to Mysteries’, hopped down from the stage, and
quickly walked over to where Eva was.

She was standing in the directions where hiccups could be heard.

“Eva.”

“Y-yes…?”

Eva responded after deactivating \[Stealth\].

\[Eva Heilov\] **Psychology:** \[Extremely terrified of you.\]

“I-I-I did everything I… was told…!”

She began crying even though all I did was call her name.

She already knew that I was the ‘Black Monster’. She’d probably
confirmed it after sensing my mana just now.

I felt kind of bad doing it, but putting a lot of pressure on Eva was
the best way to persuade (intimidate) her.

I was planning to protect everyone in the academy, including Eva, but I
needed to keep my identity hidden in order to achieve that. The less
that the academy’s staff heard about me, the better. I had
circumstances, after all.

***If you end up meeting a demon in Atla Hall, keep everything you saw
that day a secret. Many people will either be saved or be condemned to
death according to your choice.***

Eva was not only a coward but she was also someone with a normal and
sensible personality, so words worked quite well on her.

She had pointlessly mustered the courage to sell information about me to
others, but right now she was overcome with plenty of regret and fear. I
had confirmed this by using \[Psychology Insight\] on her for the past
several days.

Someone who was practically a big bundle of regret and fear wouldn’t do
the same thing twice.

“Keep everything you saw a secret. The only thing you did today was
enjoy the gathering.”

Eva was quivering head to toe as she vigorously nodded back.

We’d already had this conversation before. Since there was nothing more
to say, I resumed walking.

Eventually, the space that had been created by \[Mad Banquet\] had
completely disappeared.

Life began returning to the students’ eyes. Everyone had been freed from
the world of illusion.

I had already slipped out of Atla Hall by the time that an awkward
silence had fallen upon everyone.

“…”

I paused for a moment as I closed the doors to Atla Hall behind me and
stepped out into the hallway.

I took a deep breath.

And let out a prolonged sigh of relief as I sank to the floor.

“Whewwww…”

***I almost lost…***

Technically speaking, I would have lost if Malrog had decided to attack
me.

***It had been a while since I’ve seen the Great Witch of Heaven’s
Wrath. I’m sure she would have said hello before I went on to the
afterlife.***

I quietly gathered my breath, briefly reveling in the fact that I was
still alive.

I heard something noisy on the other side of the doors. It was the sound
of ordinary chatting and music. Everyone’s memories had been rewritten
without incident.

But at this point, I had already left.

I wanted to hurry up and see Dorothy, whom I’d promised to meet.

***Today has been kind of exhausting.***

<span id="0081_82_-_Social_Gathering_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 82: - Social Gathering (5)
==================================

**༺ Social Gathering (5) ༻**

The party was in full swing.

I made my way over to our meeting place. The party venue in the third
building of Palace Hall.

Inside the fancy party venue, nicely dressed students were slightly
intoxicated as they chatted pleasantly with each other.

There was where Dorothy was supposed to be.

‘Where’s Dorothy?’

I quickly scanned the venue in search of her.

After resolving to attend the social gathering at Atla Hall, I changed
my mind and decided to accept Dorothy’s proposal to be her partner.

Would I stand out if I was with Dorothy? Well, it wasn’t like I needed
to hide myself like a mole burrowing underground after all.

Alice couldn’t act rashly right now because the academy’s staff knew
about the informant.

Moreover, there were plenty of other students with the ice element who
were far stronger than me, so it was unlikely for her to identify me as
the Black Monster.

***The scenario itself had become twisted.***

Even Dorothy was on my side.

And even the groundless rumors about me and Luce being in a relationship
hadn’t really done any harm.

‘In that case…’

It was better to show off my friendship with Dorothy than it was to go
out of my way to avoid attention.

This way, even if Alice ended up taking an interest in me, she wouldn’t
be able to harass me if the fact that I was under Dorothy’s protection
became widely known.

***I only need to hold out until the Alice subjugation anyway.***

Naturally, I was only going to emphasize the fact that I was close with
Dorothy at the gathering today. I had no intention of clinging to her
and using her in the future.

***…But all this was just an excuse.***

‘I just felt a little tired.’

To be honest, I wanted to take a short break. I was human too, so I
couldn’t keep running like a madman forever.

I needed to take breaks every now and then, just like back when I was
studying full-time.

I expected to be exhausted after dealing with Malrog.

And just as I had expected, my energy was rapidly grained as soon as my
nerves relaxed. The war of nerves I had waged against Malrog left me
really fatigued.

***I had expected this, so that’s why I’d decided to spend a day off
with Dorothy, who had asked me to be her partner.***

But, for some reason… I couldn’t find Dorothy anywhere. I couldn’t find
her no matter where I looked.

‘I am a bit early…’

***Is she not here yet because I got here early?***

I was lost in thought when I suddenly heard a familiar voice next to me.

“What a coincidence. You’re attending the gathering too, I see.”

The voice exuded an elegance that was befitting of a young lady but also
had the sharpness of a blade as well.

I turned around to see who it was.

The owner of the voice was wearing a crimson rose hair clip in her brown
bob and a crimson dress. It was Rose Red Rivera.

Next to her was a handsome young man wearing a stylish suit.

His hair was the same brown as Rose’s and a crimson rose was pinned to
his chest.

It looked like he was a student from the Knight Department, judging by
his muscular physique and the sword at his waist.

‘I think I’ve seen him in the game. He’s probably…’

***Ah, right, Rose’s older brother. A senior.***

He was about a head taller than me. I was around 175 cm, so he was
pretty tall.

“Oh, good to see you.”

In any event, I greeted them with a smile.

Rose and I couldn’t be said to be on good terms even with empty words,
but let’s let bygones be bygones.

***Surely she wasn’t about to pick a fight with me in the middle of a
party, right?***

…And yet, Rose was scowling in displeasure.

“Looks like you don’t have a partner… Then again, who’d want to be
partners with someone like *you*?”

***I knew it was too good to be true.***

***Wait a minute, didn’t*** **you** ***drag your brother here with you
because you don’t have a partner either?***

“Who’s this brat, Rose?”

“Remember, Lord Brother Razel? He’s the asshole I told you about
before.”

Rose crossed her arms.

There was blatant malice in her laughter-filled speech. It looked like
she was spewing hot air because she had her reliable older brother with
her.

Razel, Rose’s older brother, frowned and looked back at me mockingly.

“He’s a very lousy and cocky man… He also hurt me before, and he’s the
same pig who screwed me over.”

She was suddenly reminding me of the saying about throwing people under
the bus.

After all, Rose had always been the instigator of our little feud.

“Isn’t that all in the past? Besides, you were always the one who
started…”

*Smack—!*

I felt a sudden impact against my cheek as my head whipped to one side.
It had happened out of nowhere.

***‘What the hell…?’***

My cheek was throbbing. Razel, Rose’s older brother, had punched me in
the face.

“You didn’t collapse. You’re better than I expected.”

Razel had taken out a handkerchief and was wiping off his fist. He was
acting like he had touched something dirty.

The atmosphere inside the party venue cooled rapidly. Even with the
music still playing, it was glaringly obvious because everyone had
suddenly stopped talking.

Everyone had turned to look at us, wondering what was going on.

“That was for hurting Rose, my beloved little sister, and making her
upset. You need to be put in your place.”

\[Razel Red Rivera\] **Lv:** 78

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire, Lightning

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Feels humiliated by you.\]

My mood cooled.

***This asshole is pissing me off even more because he sounds
well-educated and high-class.***

His slander had been said with decorum, but it was filled with his
disdain for me nonetheless.

“Even after all the things you have done to my sister, you have the
audacity to say, ‘Good to see you’…? You have neither shame nor sense, I
see. Don’t you think your greeting was improper?”

Razel finished wiping down his fist and put his handkerchief back in his
pocket.

It wasn’t as if he’d gotten blood or filth on his hand. He hadn’t
actually wiped away anything. Except for the dust on my skin, perhaps.

“Perhaps it’s because you haven’t been properly educated. You must be
from a poor commoner family. Let me take the chance to spell things out
for you right here and right now. This might be the academy, but you
should never forget your origins. You need to know yourself better.”

“…Oh yeah?”

“Be respectful when you talk to me.”

Razel’s elegant and aristocratic speech seemed to fill up with frost.

“Don’t you know that juniors are supposed to show respect to their
seniors? How dare you speak so casually with me?”

***After some reflection, I realized that Razel had a point. It was
certainly true that I had greeted Rose improperly.***

“You’re right. I apologize, Senior. Please let me give my greetings
again.”

This was the *proper* way to greet her.

I held up my right hand and flipped the bird at Rose and Razel.

“A pleasure to meet you here, you fucking imbeciles.”

Rose started freaking out. ***I guess she really liked my greeting.***

\[Razel Red Rivera\] **Psychology:** \[Feels insulted and enraged at
you.\]

Just as I had expected, the emotions vanished from Razel’s face as he
began swinging his fist again.

***Well, whatever. This will actually help me relieve some stress. Let’s
throw some hands, shall we?***

“…!”

Just then, a bunch of colorful stars appeared on top of Razel’s head.

*Sparkle—.*

*Swoooosh——!!*

“Ack!!”

Razel, who had just been about to punch me, suddenly vanished from my
field of vision as if he had been teleported.

His body was being pulled somewhere at an incredible speed.

He was being pulled toward the doors. Rose and I turned around to look,
startled.

*Thud—!*

*Sparkle——!*

“A-argh!”

In front of the doors.

A woman with lavender hair that complemented her refined violet dress
was holding Razel by the head with her outstretched hand. In an instant,
there was a sudden gush of wind, and clusters of stars were dispersed.

Razel kneeled on the floor as he struggled, but the woman didn’t budge.
It was as if she was an iron wall.

Stars of every color were floating around them.

Starlight magic dealt with all kinds of forces. A powerful, compulsive
force had pulled Razel all the way to the woman’s hand.

The woman was employing gravity too as she grabbed Razel’s head with so
much force I was afraid it might explode.

She had even cast the highest level of \[Basic Protection Magic\]. There
was no way that Razel would be able to put a single scratch on the woman
no matter how hard he struggled.

“…”

***Emotionless.***

The woman’s eyes, which seemed to contain the universe within them,
turned to Razel.

Heavy mana weighed heavily on the air. I could even feel her bloodlust,
which involuntarily sent a shiver down my spine.

The other students who were watching the spectacle fared no better.

The orchestra stopped playing. The musicians were also flustered and
broke out into a cold sweat as they watched the woman with lavender
hair.

The only sound that filled the venue was Razel’s desperate screaming.

“G-aah…! My head, my head…!! Argh!! S-save me…!!”

Razel had been overflowing with dignity just mere moments ago, but it
was completely gone now. All I could see was an ordinary animal
struggling desperately for survival.

***It reminded me that regardless of status, all were equal before
death.***

The woman with lavender hair stood still as she held Razel by the head.

She was the second year top seat of the Magic Department and the
strongest powerhouse at Märchen Academy, Dorothy Heartnova.

“S-shouldn’t someone stop her…?”

“Dorothy, it’s Dorothy…! Who’s even capable of stopping her…? Ack!”

*Swish—!*

*Crash——!*

Dorothy tossed Razel off to the side, bringing him crashing down with
the gravitational pull generated by her starlight magic.

The floor cracked and formed a crater as Razel’s body was crushed
against it.

In the midst of the cluster of stars, he coughed up blood before passing
out.

A suffocating silence filled the venue.

“L-Lord Brother…? Eek!”

Then, Dorothy began walking over to where Rose was.

“W-why are you coming this way…?!”

I felt a dense bloodlust. The cluster of stars that twinkled in and out
of view around Dorothy were very intimidating.

Rose stepped back in terror, but then she tripped over her own dress and
fell over backward.

Dorothy’s face was frigid as she looked down at Rose. Rose was trembling
as if she was inflected by the plague.

She probably felt like she was walking on eggshells. Even I could feel
her terror just by standing next to her.

“I-I-I… I didn’t d-do anything…!”

And then.

A delicate smile graced Dorothy’s frigid features.

“Sorry, but he’ll be coming with me. He’s my partner, you see.”

Every single attendee could hear her voice loud and clear because the
venue was in absolute silence.

Dorothy retracted her stars, grabbed my wrist, and turned around.

“What?”

Rose looked utterly baffled.

The other students shared her sentiment. I could hear them saying things
like, “Dorothy’s partner?” and, “*Him*?”

Dorothy was the strongest powerhouse at Märchen Academy. As expected,
the fact that I was her partner garnered a lot of attention on me.

“Let’s go, President\~.”

“Senior?”

Dorothy dragged me by the wrist as she quickly began walking away.

Her pull was weak because she wasn’t using any magic, but I let her pull
me along anyway.

“Oh, I forgot.”

Dorothy snapped her fingers as if she remembered something.

Suddenly, a faint cluster of stars appeared around Rose’s head.

*Swoosh—!*

*Pow!*

“Gaah!”

Gravity suddenly pulled from every direction at once, and Rose’s head
suddenly toppled sideways and slammed into the floor.

Rose laid on the floor as she groaned.

That was the last thing I saw as Dorothy and I left the venue.

<span id="0082_83_-_The_Battle_for_Isaac_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 83: - The Battle for Isaac (1)
======================================

**༺ The Battle for Isaac (1) ༻**

“Did I ruin the mood? Sorry about that.”

Dorothy and I left Palace Hall and sat down on a bench. The night air
was on the chillier side.

The shimmering streetlights illuminated the hall around us.

The flowerbeds surrounding us flaunted the many colors of mana.

“Pfft! Puhehehe…”

Although I felt bad about laughing while Dorothy was depressed, I
couldn’t hold it in any longer and let out a strange laugh.

Watching Razel getting shut down had been so satisfying and funny.

“President? Why are you laughing?”

“You put that bastard right where he belonged. Wow, you’re seriously the
best, Senior…!”

Dorothy flinched.

She turned her gaze to me and stared holes into me for a bit before she
turned around completely and smiled slyly.

“…Hmph. You find that funny? That’s harsh\~.”

Her tone was playful.

Dorothy’s previously depressed expression was nowhere to be seen,
probably thanks to my reaction.

*‘Oh?’*

I’d noticed it before too, but seeing Dorothy up close made me realize
just how much effort she had put into dressing up today.

***My favorite character’s absolutely radiant today. You’re killing me
here, big sis****.*

In any case, Dorothy had gotten mad on my behalf.

The fact that my favorite character had gotten angry on my behalf, just
like how Luce had during the end-of-semester evaluation, gave me a great
sense of pride.

**I was incredibly excited.** ***Doesn’t this show just how important
Dorothy has become to me?***

***My life as a die-hard Dorothy fan—I don’t regret it at all****.*

*‘Hmm?’*

Dorothy was smiling. Her cheeks were flushed with a scarlet hue. She
also smelled faintly of alcohol.

“Did you drink a lot, Senior?”

“Not a lot, just a little while I was waiting for you, President… I
think? This big sis is a bit tipsy!”

“And you’re a bit tongue-tied too.”

I could hear it when I listened carefully. Her voice rang with the
cutesy charm of a drunk woman.

“Well, anyway, what should we do now? It’ll be hard to go back to
building 3 because of the mood. Building 1 is… hmm. Building 2 seemed
prettier, so why don’t we go there?”

Room 1 was where Alice, the Student Council President, would show up to
enjoy the gathering. I didn’t particularly want to go there.

“That sounds good too, but…”

Dorothy looked up and pointed at the spire of Palace Hall.

“How about over there?”

“That’s not a part of the venue, though?”

“That’s okay. Besides, the wind is refreshing there\~.”

“…!”

***How can this be?***

***Is she saying that we should spend some alone time together?***

“Let’s go right now.”

“Nihihi, okay!”

*Sparkle—.*

A cluster of stars formed around me. Warm star mana enveloped my body.

My body slowly started feeling lighter.

Then, Dorothy and I started floating. It was as if we had become
weightless.

A glistening cluster of stars formed beautifully around us.

“Senior.”

I extended my right hand to Dorothy from within the colorful cluster of
stars.

I intended to escort her, just as I had promised. I had already been
protected by her, but I figured that I should at least keep up the
pretense.

Dorothy stared blankly at my hand. Then, she beamed brightly once she
realized why I had extended it to her.

She gently placed her hand on top of mine.

Her hand was supple, soft, and pretty. Dorothy was grinning as she only
placed her hand on top of mine instead of holding it.

We stayed just like that as the star mana brought us up to the spire of
Palace Hall.

On top of the spire. There were a lot more places to walk here than I
had originally thought.

Moreover, the mana stones embedded within the structures were sparkling
with a beautiful array of colors.

**All around us were the glistening colors of Märchen Academy.** ***It’s
beautiful, but I’ll probably kick the bucket if I fall from here****.*

We could clearly hear the music from Palace Hall seeping outside. The
mood here was pretty nice.

“This kind of thing is new to you, right?”

Dorothy and I sat down against the banister and enjoyed the view of the
academy.

Even if one of us carelessly fell off, we’d still be safe thanks to her
starlight magic.

“Yes, I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s nice.”

“It’s pretty romantic here, no? I came alone last year, but I’m here
with you today.”

“It’s an honor.”

I didn’t know for sure because I didn’t have a mirror on me, but my
expression was most likely very relaxed right now.

“President.”

“Yes?”

“You’re always working yourself to the bone. This is your first day off,
isn’t it? You’ve even put down your usual training obsession.”

“Yes, I’m resting of my own free will.”

“Nihihi, this big sis of yours will do anything I can for you today,
within reason of course! I’ll cheer you on with everything that I have,
President!”

***Your existence alone already cheers me on.***

But actually saying that would feel too forward, so I settled for
saying, “Thank you.” instead.

“What do you want me to do for you first?”

With perfect timing, the music coming from Palace Hall suddenly turned
sweet and mellow. It was the song that played in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ when the player danced with their chosen heroine.

The ball had probably started inside the hall.

“Shall we dance?”

“Okay! Let’s dance!”

We stood up and faced each other as we got ready to dance.

I’d said the first thing that came to mind, but the thought that we were
actually about to hold a private outdoor ball for just the two of us on
this moonlit night was starting to make me squirm.

But I immediately felt better after I wrapped an arm around Dorothy’s
slender waist, gently took her hand, and started dancing.

The music was loud enough that it didn’t feel awkward.

The moonlit night and the scenery around us were overflowing with
aesthetic sensibility. I felt like I was getting absorbed by the mood.

“I think I’m getting a little excited\~.”

It looked like Dorothy shared the same sentiment.

Her steps were light, like the fluttering of a butterfly, as she danced
to the melody.

Dorothy smiled timidly as she continued,

“President, there’s something I wanna try.”

“…What is it?”

“Once you no longer have to train so hard…”

“Yes?”

“Well, I heard that Regell’s Croissants are really famous for being
tasty. Let’s go and eat some together.”

“Sure. That sounds great.”

“Oh, and did you know? Lake Frey in the Astrea Duchy is supposed to be
really pretty. I saw it in a book. Let’s go see that too.”

“Certainly. I’ll pack the snacks.”

“They say the moss forest inside the Vantus Woods in Medellnook is super
pretty too.”

“Let’s go see it together someday.”

“Nihihi, and…”

Dorothy continued listing out all the things that she wanted to do for
some time. The sparkles in her eyes as she spoke made her seem like an
innocent little girl.

I knew that Dorothy had been slowly going through everything she owned.

That was why I could keenly feel just how heavy her plans for the future
weighed, even though she was saying them so nonchalantly.

Was this Dorothy’s true feelings, which had never come up even in ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱?

Was she speaking so candidly right now because she was drunk and she was
with someone to whom she had opened up her heart to?

Dorothy hadn’t been a very important character in the game because she
wasn’t one of the heroines. That was why I had no way to know for sure
what she was really feeling.

The only thing I could do for her right now was to respond accordingly
and etch everything she wanted to do inside my brain.

“So that’s why I’m hoping you’ll still continue meeting with me like
this even after I graduate, President.”

Dorothy had stopped dancing and was looking back at me from point-blank,
and I serenely replied,

“That was my plan from the very beginning.”

“…I guess you’re right. You’re a fan of mine, after all.”

Dorothy grinned.

“I guess I was worried for no reason.”

Dorothy stepped back into my arms and resumed dancing with me.

\* \* \*

It was very bizarre.

Kaya’s consciousness grew fuzzy whenever she fully expressed her
feelings for Isaac, and this happened quite often. She felt strange
every time it happened, it was as if someone else took over and piloted
her body.

Then, one day, she suddenly stopped feeling like she was dreaming while
sleepwalking.

And she started hearing a cute and charming voice in her mind.

*—‘Sir Isaac’s so cool.’*

—\[Sir Isaac’s so cool.\]

*—‘…Huh?’*

She had thought that she was hallucinating at first, but she knew
exactly what that voice was now.

It was Kaya’s other personality. It had a concrete form now, and it was
capable of conversing with Kaya directly. In other words, it had formed
its own ego.

Perhaps it had simply been adapting until now.

Kaya’s two personalities shared their memories. They shared their
feelings and senses too. Her original personality had merely been split
into two.

Kaya felt a profound yet mysterious sense of unity with it, like it was
both someone else while also being herself. It had been scary at first,
but she had quickly gotten used to it.

Now, she was actually grateful it was there.

Unlike herself, her other personality was overflowing with confidence
and was capable of assertively expressing their feelings for Isaac.

That was why Kaya became friends with her other personality in no time
at all.

“Fuaaah…”

Atla Hall, the heart of Palace Hall. The Four Constellation’s event was
suspended due to an unexpected accident, and the venue had brightened up
again

.

Besides, tonight’s event had basically been called off for good because
one of the Four Constellation’s heads, Malrog Bryer, had disappeared.

Even still, the mood inside Atla Hall was amicable to promote
friendships between the top-ranking students who had gathered there, so
the gathering continued anyway.

The only strange part was that the students’ conversations all centered
around a certain man.

“Seriously… Has Isaac lost his mind? How could he suddenly kiss Lady
Kaya on the cheek like that…? Look how flustered she is…!”

“For real? I didn’t even see it happening. D-does he not value his
life…?”

“Wait, what are you guys talking about? I saw the bastard holding hands
with Lady Lisetta—what’s this about Lady Kaya?”

“W-wait, what?”

“The hell are you all on about? The bastard was pestering our goddess,
Lady Keridna, wasn’t he?”

“What the hell are *you* talking about?”

For some reason… none of the students’ memories were lining up.

Meanwhile, Kaya, who was standing right in the middle of the hall, could
hear neither the music nor a single word of what the other students were
saying.

Kaya had been standing around with her hands clasped over her cheeks,
letting out gasp after gasp.

Her elevated body temperature showed no signs of cooling down anytime
soon. And her eyes were spinning in circles.

Her eyes were jade green. This was the original Kaya. She was looking
down because she needed some time to pull herself back together.

\[Happy, aren’t we?\]

It felt like someone was directly hugging her from behind and whispering
into her ear. This was her Dark personality.

\[I never imagined that Sir Isaac would say, ‘You’re prettier than
everyone else here,’ to me. Aha, what am I supposed to do with myself?
I’m so happy.\]

*‘S-stop it. I’m going to die of embarrassment.’*

Kaya was so embarrassed she thought she would lose her mind.

Who would have thought…? As soon as the party at Atla Hall had started
and the lights had dimmed…

…That Isaac would whisper such sweet words into her ear?

It had truly happened out of nowhere. Dark Kaya had looked into Isaac’s
crimson eyes for a bit before smiling shrewdly and summoning the normal
Kaya.

Kaya’s eyes had returned to their normal jade green. She swallowed a
gasp and covered her mouth with both hands.

Then, Isaac had said that he had something to do and headed toward the
exit.

Kaya had staggered like she was about to pass out. Her body temperature
had elevated, and she had been rooted to the spot.

All of this was actually just a fake memory created after Malrog had
been dealt with to replace her memories of the illusions she had seen.

But to Kaya… the fake memory remained vivid in her mind.

\[Teehee, Sir Isaac was interested in us. It was worth dressing up.\]

*‘Fuwaaaaa…’*

\[Let’s go and give him a kiss.\]

*‘Huh?!’*

The ravenous darkness whetted her appetite.

\[Our feelings aren’t one-sided anymore; they’re mutual. We need to take
the opportunity to stamp our mark on his lips.\]

*‘Well, that’s… I mean, but still, I…? To Sir Isaac?’*

\[Don’t you want to?\]

It was like the devil was whispering in her ear.

\[Because I do.\]

Both her thoughts and her actions were bold. Kaya had no idea how she
had created a personality like her.

‘…’

Isaac was her first love. She had lost count of how many times she had
imagined kissing him.

Kaya could not bring herself to deny her dark side’s question no matter
how embarrassed she was.

She squeezed her eyes shut and opened them again. Her eyes instantly
changed into the bright color of blood.

“The other me is so bad at being honest.”

There was a treacherous smile on Dark Kaya’s lips as she left the venue.

Meanwhile. There was a female student leaning against the wall of Palace
Hall.

She was wearing a lovely blue dress. Her prettily braided rose-gold hair
was beautifully adorned with a morpho butterfly bow and hairpins shaped
like jeweled blue flowers.

Every student who passed her had their gazes drawn to her. The female
student with the rose-gold hair’s appearance had the power to turn
anyone’s head.

She was Luce Eltania, the top seat of the Magic Department’s first
years.

Her interview with the Eldork Magic Tower had been incredibly useful.
After all, she had been able to hear firsthand detailed stories about
real-world matters that she could not learn from the academy at the
moment.

After the interview, Luce had returned to Charles Hall, the
highest-ranking dorm, and had made her way to Atlas Hall as soon as the
maids had dressed her up.

Originally, her interview with the Eldork Magic Tower was supposed to
have lasted longer.

***But Luce had desperately wanted to attend the gathering and have fun
with Isaac no matter what…!***

That was why she had ended the interview early after taking only the key
pieces of information that she needed from the Eldork Magic Tower.

\[We’re back, Luce.\]

\[Bello, returning like the wind!\]

Two magic beasts—a black grouse as small as a raven and a small orca
wrapped in water mana—flew toward Luce. They were Galia and Bello.

Galia landed on Luce’s extended wrist, and Bello swam around her.

Luce had ordered them to find Isaac, and they had come back from
surveying the various venues.

\[It looked like Isaac went to Building 3. According to what I overheard
the other students saying, it sounded like he had a partner. They
apparently went outside together.\]

Luce hadn’t known that Isaac had a partner.

She didn’t have the chance to ask him if he had one because of her
interview with the magic tower.

Even still, she could not avoid the mental shock.

“A partner… So he had one after all. Isaac has many friends other than
me…”

Luce’s quiet voice resounded through the night air.

Her only friend was Isaac, but Isaac had many friends.

Luce quickly clicked her tongue and lowered her eyes as she recalled
this unpleasant truth once again.

***If only there was no one else around Isaac.***

***If only she was the only person by Isaac’s side, just like how she
only had Isaac.***

***Then, she would be able to monopolize his time… monopolize his
heart.***

Luce’s regrets suddenly billowed up from within her.

\[But I also heard that Isaac got punched by a guy called Razel before
he went outside…\]

Galia swallowed a gasp and was unable to continue.

This was because Luce’s emotionless eyes had turned to him with
terrifying speed.

“What did you say?”

Her voice was quiet and restrained. Yet, there was ice-cold bloodlust
condensed inside it.

Isaac was Luce’s weakness. He was the one and only man to whom she, who
could not open her heart to anyone, had opened up her heart to.

That was why Luce could not withstand her own wrath whenever someone so
much as touched Isaac.

Galia harbored goodwill for Isaac too, but it came nothing close to what
Luce felt.

Had he said something wrong? Galia began breaking out in cold sweat.

\[Bello went and heard all about how much of a playboy Isaac is!\]

“…?”

Bello butted in just then.

Galia was grateful for the interjection itself in the midst of the
intense situation, however, it was not as grateful about the contents of
what Bello had said.

“Huh?”

This time, Luce, who had heard something shocking once again, turned to
Bello in bewilderment.

\[According to what the other students were saying! He kissed Kaya on
the cheek, held Lisetta’s hand, and pestered Keridna! Not that I know
who any of them are!\]

“…”

\[And then he immediately left the party! He’s pretty good, that Isaac!
I, Bello, the Brave Orca, saw you yet again, you rascal! Wahaha!\]

Bello explained everything he had heard in a cheerful voice like that of
a young boy.

He was a magic beat orca who had gotten all excited without being able
to read the room.

Luce began emitting a dark and chilling bloodlust. The bloodlust only
grew denser with every word Bello said.

Galia gulped. There was… a dark shadow over Luce’s eyes.

The students probably hadn’t been saying stuff like that about Isaac for
no reason.

And, while Luce didn’t think that Isaac was the type of guy to randomly
go around and hit on girls.

The truth remained that something had happened to make it look like he
was.

\[What are you planning to do, Luce?\]

Galia asked anxiously.

“I need to find Isaac.”

Luce’s eyes swept across Palace Hall.

***Just what on earth had Isaac done here while she was gone, and what
happened to him?***

He had been punched by Razel, and he was apparently a playboy… Luce
could not simply ignore this.

This became the catalyst, and ultimately, it made Luce determined to use
her last resort.

*Swish.*

The magic tool that she had prepared in advance shot out from under her
sleeve.

It was a small rod. Once activated, mana would flow out from it and tie
up its target.

It was a powerful restraining device that used Luce’s mana to great
effect. It was something that the Eltania Family had prepared.

***“I think I need to be by Isaac’s side right now.”***

Luce did not intend to harm any healthy relationships that Isaac had.
After all, doing so would go against both the law and her own morals.

But if he was getting punched like what Galia had said or was hitting on
any woman at random like what Bello had said…

Then Luce wanted to make it so that he would have to stick with her,
even if she had to use a little force to make it happen.

Her protective instinct, her possessiveness, the affection she felt for
her one and only friend… All of these emotions began tangling endlessly
together like a spider’s web. The feelings that Luce had for Isaac were
anything but simple.

\[Isaac has a partner right now… Are you going to ignore that fact and
bring him over anyway?\]

“Yes.”

Galia’s head flinched ever so slightly when it heard Luce’s firm reply.

“Both Isaac and his partner probably have other people whom they can
substitute each other with. They probably won’t care too much if just
one of the many people around them disappears. But that’s not the case
for me.”

***Luce didn’t care if this made her selfish.***

***She wanted to see Isaac so badly, and she wanted to be with him.***

“I only have Isaac.”

Her face was icy as she began walking away.

***For now, she had decided to get rid of one person before going to see
Isaac.***

Chapter 84: - The Battle for Isaac (2)
======================================

**༺ The Battle for Isaac (2) ༻**

“Kreung… Hm?”

Blue bobbed hair that curled like a wave gently shook as Ciel Carnedas
slowly opened her eyes.

During the first semester, the pillow she got from Isaac was truly of
the highest quality, even certified nap experts would attest to its
profound quality. No matter where she was, her body relaxed and sleep
would consume her.

Ciel slowly got up.

Due to it being the day of the social gathering, Ciel was dressed in an
elegant blue dress by the maids of Charles Hall.

However, it appeared as if she was apathetic about whether she looked
good or if the outfit matched the atmosphere. Instead, she wrapped
herself in a thick overcoat as if she were a sushi roll.

The cool autumn air blew into her face. It was the middle of the night.

***Where is this place? It seems a bit high…***

As Ciel rubbed her eyes, she tried to remember what happened before she
fell asleep.

“Spire…”

This was the spire of Palace Hall. When the party began, she must’ve
made her bat familiar, Zabet, bigger in order to fly to the top of the
spire.

***It was nice to have the railing around the perimeter to protect me
from the cold autumn wind.***

Ciel quietly yawned while listening to a lullaby-like song playing from
Palace Hall.

The music soothed her into a state of sleepiness, but it seemed like it
was time to get up and work again. After all, sleeping outside at night
was not something she should do.

As Ciel raised her small body, she looked towards the academy landscape
beyond the railings.

“Huh?”

On the opposite spire, she saw a woman and man gracefully dancing. It
was a woman with lavender hair and a man with silver-blue hair.

Ciel folded her arms and rested her chin on the railing, as she watched
them perform their little dance with half-closed eyes. It looked like
quite a romantic sight to her.

However… the man’s appearance seemed a bit too familiar.

“…!”

Ciel’s sleepiness disappeared in an instant.

The man dancing was Isaac, the monster who had given Ciel her cherished
pillow.

The memories of the end-of-semester evaluation passed through her mind.

The images of Luce getting angry for Isaac and protecting him passed
through her mind. Not only that, but even Kaya did the same.

She thought if Isaac were to date anyone, it would be one of those two.

‘But why is he dancing alone with a girl I have never seen before?’

Although it had nothing to do with her, when she imagined Luce chasing
her with a knife, chills ran down Ciel’s back.

Luce’s anger was so great at the end-of-semester evaluation that it
wouldn’t have been weird if she went on a killing spree.

‘Wait, they’re going down… What is that?’

As if they finished enjoying their time at the spire, Isaac and the
lavender-haired girl began their descent.

With a cluster of colorful stars circling around their bodies, they took
their time descending.

It was only at that moment that Ciel recognized the woman with Isaac.

“That magic… is that Dorothy Heartnova?”

Dorothy’s reputation was well-known in the academy.

She was the continent’s greatest prodigy who was expected to reach the
level of an Archwizard within a mere decade.

Somehow, Isaac seemed to have a talent for attracting beautiful and
capable girls.

‘Is it that the strong recognizes the strong?’

Since Ciel was not able to recognize Isaac’s strength at first, she
automatically assumed herself to be on the weaker side.

***Even if she was the freshman third seat of the Magic Department in
the continent’s most prestigious academy, if people like Isaac hid their
power, did her position even mean anything?***

Ciel let out a forced laugh as she watched Isaac and Dorothy.

In a moment, however, she witnessed a shivering scene.

\* \* \*

“Senior, are you sober now?”

“Nihihi, you think so?”

Dorothy and I came down to the surface in a beautiful cluster of stars.
It was to hang out in the garden.

As we landed in a deserted spot, we bashfully smiled at each other.

“I’m going to take a quick trip to the restroom then.”

“Come back soon!”

“Yup!”

Before I could take a walk with Dorothy, I had to address nature’s call
first.

After talking with Dorothy, I hurried to the restroom inside Palace
Hall. Then, I relieved myself with a powerful jet of urine into the
bronze urinal.

‘I’m happy.’

***Is this what life as a successful fan feels like?***

***When I was young, I sometimes imagined hanging out with my favorite
celebrity. Is this how it feels when imagination becomes reality?***

Even though I only danced with Dorothy for a short while, I felt like I
was still flying in the night sky.

Maybe this feeling was similar to the one I would get when I played
games during exam season. After a grueling day of defeating another
demon, this night of relaxation with Dorothy brought me a profound sense
of liberation.

‘I’m gonna enjoy this as much as I can before I leave.’

While trying to hold back my smile, I left Palace Hall.

In that moment, from behind.

A hand reached out and grabbed my sleeve.

“Isaac, I found you.”

A beautiful voice that seemed to have been made with the sole intention
of enchanting people assaulted my ears.

For a moment, my whole body was simultaneously bombarded with ecstatic
pleasure and goosebumps, creating a weird dissonance.

I turned my head around. There, a girl with rose-gold hair stared at me
intensely.

The woman just stood there in a sophisticated blue dress, her hair
decorated with a hairpin in the shape of a morpho butterflies and blue
flowers.

“Luce?”

A beautiful appearance that shone as bright as the moon in the night
sky.

It was Luce Eltania.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 152

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** ??

**Psychology:** \[Wants to spend the entire night with you.\]

***Why is she here? Isn’t she supposed to be having an interview at the
Magic Tower…?***

More importantly, Luce’s ‘Danger’ panel rang alarm bells in my head.

‘What the fuck is that Danger Level?’

Luce’s strong obsessive tendencies were not new to me at all.

***However, the ‘??’ beside her Danger Level seemed quite worrisome…***

The level of danger was officially determined by measuring the product
of their combat power and killing intent.

So if one has no killing intent, there would be no danger whatsoever.

Sometimes, in exceptional cases, the ‘potential to harm’ was also
considered when measuring the Danger Level.

For reference, the Danger Level of Luce’s in Extra Bad Ending No. 13 was
‘?■?’.

***If this ever shows, consider yourself screwed.***

Anyway, I decided to react as naturally as possible.

“What in the world, what happened to the interview?”

“I finished it quickly and came to see you. Isaac, just stay with me
from now on.”

Luce had her usual gentle smile. As expected of one of my favorite
characters, she was exceptionally beautiful.

***However…***

’She finished the interview this quickly?’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, unless the player chose her as a partner,
she never went to the social gatherings.

…Whatever. It was pointless to use the original game as evidence now. In
the first place, predicting Luce’s behavior had become futile after
befriending her.

Luce probably ended her interview early to enjoy the gathering with me.

But alas, I was currently partnered with Dorothy.

Even if I wanted to play with Luce today, it would be difficult. It
would be better if I rejected her firmly.

“I’m sorry, but I have a partner today. It’ll be a bit difficult to hang
out wi-”

“I wasn’t asking.”

Luce’s swift reply left me dumbfounded.

“Even if it’s from now on, stay by my side.”

Luce’s sweet voice was distracting me.

She seemed a bit off for some reason.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Wishes to monopolize your affection
so you don’t flirt with any other woman.\]

I was flustered when I read Luce’s psychology.

***Me? Flirting with any and every girl? What kind of worry is that? Why
would I want anyone else when my partner is Dorothy?***

I swear I have never shown signs of flirting with anyone.

However, Luce was the type to consider everything carefully. She didn’t
look like she was sick and had her mental capacities stunted, nor did
she seem drunk.

Thus, there must be a good enough reason for this strange
misunderstanding.

I racked my brain quickly. If a lie was made up as if it was the truth,
then…

‘…it’s the fabricated memories.’

When Marlog the Envious was killed, the memories of the students at Atla
Hall would have been altered.

***Were those memories changed into crazy stories about me?***

When Luce arrived at the party, she must have been looking for me,
whether she searched on her own or summoned her familiars.

During her search, what if she heard those types of stories about me at
Atla Hall? Then, Luce’s current thought pattern made complete sense.

I let out a low sigh and relaxed my expression. It couldn’t be helped
then.

I turned towards Luce and calmly told her my story.

“Luce, I’ll say this again. I have already promised to hang out with
someone today. Honestly, it isn’t right to betray their trust like thi-”

*Chieek—*

“…?”

On the wrist that Luce was holding, mana coiled around in the form of a
ring.

As if they were handcuffs put on by the police, the mana rings
intertwined my wrist with Luce’s. The two rings were joined together.

Only then did she let go of my sleeve. It seemed like she was more
relaxed after safely(?) tying me up.

“Luce, what is this…?”

The question was meaningless, since as long as one had half a brain,
anyone could easily deduce this situation.

They were restraints. Not only that, they were high-quality restraints…
made of mana.

I thought she wouldn’t take out something like this after the hunting
evaluation, but she brought an improved version instead…?

‘I thought you couldn’t bring anything in during the middle of the
semester?”

***No way, did she prepare this in advance…?***

When I thought of this, I had goosebumps all over my body.

***Unbeknownst to me, Luce had already made preparations to meet
Greung.***

“It can’t be helped. Even if it’s a bit uncomfortable, please
understand.”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Doesn’t want anyone else to have
you.\]

“Isaac… needs to stay by my side.”

***Is she trying to cuff me by force so that I can’t flirt with any
woman?***

***Still, isn’t this a bit too much?***

I stood my ground and deliberately frowned. With a stern tone, I decided
to confront her.

“Are you insane? I told you this before. I hate things like th-”

It was at that moment.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

*Ssaak──!*

‘What’s happening?!’

Suddenly, a light green blade of wind flew from the sky and cut off the
mana handcuffs tying me to Luce!

***Holy crap, that surprised me…!***

Highly dense mana. It was wind magic from a skilled expert.

Just like me, Luce was startled, her eyes unable to maintain focus.

*Whooooooosh———!*

For a moment, the light green wind raged on, ruffling my hair and Luce’s
dress.

Soon after, something fell from the sky and wrapped itself around my
shoulder.

I felt a soft feeling brush the back of my head.

*Kiss—.*

A soft touch accompanied by a cute sound found my cheek.

“How could you leave me all on my own\~, Sir Isaac?”

A voice naturally mixed with excessive affection.

As she wrapped us in the light green wind, the woman hugged me from
behind and whispered into my ear.

As I turned my head to the side, I saw a pretty girl closely staring at
me with her head on my shoulder.

A deep green dress with light green hair.

Red eyes. A lascivious smile.

It was Dark Kaya.

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Lv:** (140)

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Ice, Plant, Blood

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to aggressively make out with you.\]

And.

*Whooooo———!*

“Oowah!”

A wind so concentrated with mana rendered me incapable of movement as it
flew me into the air.

My body rapidly soared into the sky with Kaya hugging onto my back.

The figure of Luce reaching out towards me became smaller and smaller as
we flew upwards.

‘Kyaaaaaak!!!!’

***I’m about to go crazy!!!!***

“I can’t lose Sir Isaac to a bitch like that!”

“K-kaya?!”

Kaya and I finally stopped after reaching a dizzying height. With our
bodies carried by her wind, it felt unstable compared to Dorothy’s
starlight magic.

Kaya finally released her back hug and flew in front of me, taking both
my hands.

***How bewildering…***

“I’ll be clear this time.”

Kaya blushed and flashed a comforting smile.

Somehow, a strange atmosphere permeated the air.

’Her memories should have been changed as well.’

I could not possibly know how Kaya’s memory was altered.

However, if it was at the level where she wanted to proactively make out
with me…

Without even needing to hear anything from her, I could easily infer
that it turned into a very embarrassing memory.

***It seems I need to quickly explain the situation to her.***

***“As of today…”***

Before I could even open my mouth Kaya leaned her face close to me.

Without hesitation, she slowly closed her eyes.

***“…I am yours, Sir Isaac.”***

Kaya pushed her lips close to me.

In that moment,

「Hydro Cannon (Water Element, ★5)」

*Booom———!!*

From where Luce was, a shining blue magic circle fired a fierce \[Hydro
Cannon\] straight at us!

In an instant, a flower-shaped tattoo bloomed from Kaya’s right cheek
and down towards her neck.

It was the floral tattoo that appeared whenever she activated her blood
magic, \[Flower of Evil\].

Dark Kaya, who was trying to kiss me, stopped and stared at the \[Hydro
Cannon\] with frightening eyes.

In succession, the light green and brilliant red magic circles produced
their respective spells before combining into a spell more radiant and
powerful than the sum of its parts. Such a spell drew a trajectory
towards its target.

Mana was poured out.

「Song of the Mountain Goat (Wind Element, ★6)」 + 「Flower of Evil
(Blood Element, ★6)」

= 「Baphomet’s Hymn (Wind + Blood Element)」

*Kwaaaaah————!!!*

Like a red-green typhoon, \[Baphomet’s Hymn\] struck violently and
quickly scattered the \[Hydro Cannon\]

The water mana that formed the \[Hydro Cannon\] splashed in every
direction.

It was Luce’s offensive magic, so Kaya must have judged that she could
not stop it unless she poured out powerful magic herself.

“That bitch is getting in the way.”

Kaya’s furious voice echoed in the air.

After \[Baphomet’s Hymn\] neutralized \[Hydro Cannon\], it disappeared
as if all its strength was lost.

In quick succession, Luce began to pour out water spells.

*Boom——-!!*

*Fwaaah——-!!!*

Kaya dodged Luce’s offensive spells with grace, hovering in the air as
she did so.

***At this point, I really might die…!***

“Let’s run away!”

Suddenly, Kaya grabbed my hand and proceeded to fly elsewhere!

‘Ahhhh!!!’

Strong winds aggressively whipped my face. My mouth and skin shook
against this merciless assault.

Suddenly, Kaya turned to look at me and smiled brightly.

As if time slowed to a crawl, her soft smile imprinted itself into my
mind.

“Sir Isaac, if we succeed in running away…”

Kaya raised a finger to her lips and smiled lewdly. Her expression was
sensual, to say the least.

“Tonight, Sir Isaac can do whatever he wants with me. Please use me as
much as you desire.”

“I’m Sir Isaac’s after all!” Kaya added with a dreamy expression on her
face.

…I didn’t know what kind of misunderstanding there was. However, the
fact that she didn’t hesitate to say such indecent things was a bit
concerning. As soon as we succeed in running away, it would probably be
a good idea to explain the incident with Malrog.

For now, I was unable to speak. The wind resistance was too strong for
my voice to make it through.

I was amazed at how Kaya could speak so well in this kind of situation.

\[Kyaaaaaa——!\]

The cry of a bird of prey rang in the air.

Covered in purple lightning, a huge black grouse ascended with splendor!

‘Ah hell nah, what the fuck is this?!”

Luce rode on Galia, her fierce eyes practically dripping with venom as
she began to chase after us at a frightening pace!

“Wow, this is a big problem…”

Kaya’s expression was one of bewilderment. To be fair, she couldn’t have
possibly known that Luce would summon a familiar capable of destroying
an entire country just to capture me.

Suddenly I felt a buzz as my head started resonating with a certain
creature. Kaya seemed to have felt a similar sensation.

***This… is the resonance that is felt before Galia starts to speak.***

\[Hand over the seed of my grandchildren right now!!\]

***I get it now! Galia, no, this sorry excuse of a father was the
biggest problem.***

Chapter 85: - The Battle for Isaac (3)
======================================

**༺ The Battle for Isaac (3) ༻**

Atla Hall, before Luce summoned the Thunderbird.

Eva Hielov, a four-eyed female student, was sitting on a chair. She was
utterly baffled about what was going on in Atla Hall.

Everyone’s memories were different and altered. More so, strange rumors
about Isaac were afloat.

***He’s a slob? He tries to flirt with any girl he can get his hands on?
That’s ridiculous.***

‘He took on a demon! A demons I tell you!’

***How does nobody know what he did?***

Whatever. In the first place, talented and skilled wizards were known
for their lack of common sense. Trying to understand them was like
trying to cover the entire ocean with a single human palm. Basically
impossible.

She repeatedly glanced at the women Isaac had supposedly touched.
However, Kaya Astrea… was nowhere to be seen.

Keridna Whiteclark, the girl with a pink bobcut, was asking people
around her.

‘Isaac came onto me…? Why am I only finding out about this now? Show me
what you have seen now.’

It seemed she didn’t know anything either. As to why she seemed so
urgent… this was indeed a mystery.

Additionally, Lisetta Lionheart with her orange ponytail was still
devouring and ripping apart the meat in front of her. As expected, she
doesn’t seem to know anything either. More importantly, how much was she
going to eat?!

Her whole body trembled in disbelief.

I***saac… has he been protecting people like this all along?***

‘I touched someone I shouldn’t have.’

Realizing this, Eva stuffed her face into her hands and started to mess
up her hair, despite the many eyes around her. She wanted to die.

\[What’s wrong?\]

“…!”

Suddenly, a familiar lady’s voice rang in Eva’s ear.

As if she heard something she wasn’t supposed to, Eva stiffened up
completely.

A white cat with a pink ribbon hanging on her tail, Ella. Dorothy
Heartnova’s familiar. It was a voice that she could never forget.

\[Long time no see, my friend?\]

“Ah, ah…”

\[Do you remember what I said before? I told you to keep what you found
out a secret.\]

“Sorry, I’m sor-!”

Ella used Dorothy’s mana to stop Eva, who was instinctively getting out
of her seat and trying to escape.

*Kkeuuu—*

“Heuk!”

\[Can you stay still for a second?\]

A strong force was pressing down on Eva’s thighs. She couldn’t move an
inch.

Eva looked at the white cat standing next to her in fear.

\[It looks like something strange happened right? Everyone has different
stories. However, you… You look completely fine.\]

“Pl, pl, please don’t hurt me…”

The strength that gripped her thighs felt like an unassailable wall. It
was as if something impossibly heavy had its entire weight on just her
legs.

Eva swallowed her tears and started pleading with Ella.

\[Don’t worry. I don’t mean any harm. More importantly, there’s
something Dorothy is curious about.\]

“I can’t say anything…”

\[What?\]

Ella came here because Dorothy wanted to make sure Isaac’s information
was not spread.

From what the students were saying, Ella assumed that Isaac had come to
Atla Hall.

Out of all of the students, the only one who looked fine was Eva which
was why she approached her.

While all the other students seemed like they were babbling as if their
memories were fabricated, Eva looked terrified while sitting quietly in
her chair.

Because of this, Eva, who was wrought with fear, paradoxically seemed
the most normal.

From inferring the situation at hand, it seemed like a mysterious
phenomenon had occurred in Atla Hall. Isaac seemed to have a hand in it.

Judging by the way he also forced Eva’s silence, it seemed like it was
Isaac’s intention to not reveal what actually happened.

\[On the contrary… Isaac knew his information was going to be sold and
he used it to his own advantage…\]

Ella’s monologue was muffled so that Eva couldn’t hear what she was
saying.

It may seem unbelievable, but Dorothy said that Isaac, who looked mild
and weak, was much stronger than she was.

Dorothy was someone who could see through the essence of everything with
the power of \[All In the World\]. There wasn’t a possibility of her
eyes being wrong.

Therefore, it would not be weird at all if a man who has risen to higher
heights than Dorothy were to play with the lives of ordinary people.

The force that weighed on Eva’s legs disappeared.

Eva was relieved with a tear-stricken face, but as soon as she heard
Ella’s voice, she reflexively held her breath.

\[I don’t want to disturb Isaac, so I’ll just let it go.\]

“Ah…”

\[Still, my friend, let’s not act out of line shall we?\]

Ella took the form of mana before she disappeared.

Eva was unable to control her trembling body for quite some time.

\* \* \*

‘Let’s get this straight.’

***What a messy night.***

I wonder if this is how a pilot feels when his fighter jet has no
cockpit window. While enjoying the wind in my face, I was lost in
thought.

In the skies above the academy, I was currently holding hands with Dark
Kaya as we flew at high speeds with the power of wind magic.

Behind us, Galia and Luce chased us as if they were dogs playing fetch.

Kaya’s memories were altered when Marlog was defeated. I assumed that
perhaps in Kaya’s memory, I made an embarrassing show of affection
toward her.

That was probably why she took me from Luce and attempted to seduce me.

‘It’s true I managed to escape captivity thanks to her.’

If it weren’t for Kaya, my wrists would’ve probably still been shackled
to Luce.

Even so, it wouldn’t have been a big deal. All I would’ve needed to do
was play with Luce for a bit and I would’ve been free in no time. That
was why I didn’t really take her handcuffs seriously.

***Of course, I’m not saying I’m into restraints. That’s not my kink at
all.***

After the Elt Island incident, I taught Luce a lesson on ethics
regarding how ‘It’s wrong to suppress the freedom of others’. As a wise
teacher, I kindly taught my cherished student Luce, yet it seemed like
my lesson had gone in one ear and out the other.

‘Should I teach her with actions instead of words?’

I should probably teach Luce the meaning of putting yourself in other
people’s shoes sometime soon. If I tie up Luce, wouldn’t she understand
my feelings in the end?

‘…Maybe that’s a bit too much.’

***Well, I don’t need to go that far I guess.***

Luce was not in an extreme enough state to be considering Extra Bad
Ending No. 13 \[Bird Cage} and even in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, she
didn’t keep the player captive after the ending…

***…I’ll choose to believe that there will be plenty of time for
reeducation.***

‘Anyway.’

Back to the current situation.

When it came down to it, it honestly wasn’t that bad.

Both Kaya and Luce were overreacting because they were drunk on their
feelings.

So for now, let’s get out of this mess and create an opportunity to talk
to these two calmly.

‘I should clear up Kaya’s misunderstanding first.’

We reached a tall clock tower surrounded by numerous buildings.

Right after we passed the clock tower, we were briefly obscured from
Galia’s field of view.

‘It’s time to fall.’

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

While trying to time my fall perfectly, I stretched my remaining hand
down and made a handle-shaped block of ice. I held onto it tightly.

From there, a mass of ice was added to the handle, creating a heavy
block of ice.

***This should be enough.***

“Ahhk!”

Kaya let out a scream. Due to the weight of the ice cube I was holding,
Kaya and I started to fall instantly.

Levitating your body with wind magic required a fine level of mana
control.

So, hypothetically speaking, let’s say that a heavy weight was suddenly
added while maintaining such difficult wind magic.

Kaya, who was accustomed to considering weight when using wind magic,
lost all her mana control.

After we started falling, I immediately got rid of the ice cube and
stretched my arms upwards, releasing icy blue flames with immense force.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Fwaaaah——!!*

“Sir Isaaaaaaaaac?!”

Since \[Frostfire\] could double as a booster, I used this method many
times in the past to accelerate or decelerate myself.

As a result, Kaya and I fell to the ground at a frightening speed.

***It’s cute when she gets so flustered. I unintentionally took my
revenge with this.***

***It’s certainly true that it feels better to drag someone around than
to be dragged around.***

“…!”

When we suddenly disappeared, Luce and Galia were stunned. Galia stopped
in the air, creating a strong gust of wind with a flap of its wings.

If one looked around for about 2 to 3 seconds, one could see us falling
vertically.

However, there were too many buildings located around the clock tower.
There was no space for Galia to squeeze his massive body between the
buildings, and there was no way they would make the extreme choice of
demolishing the buildings.

During the time Luce unsummoned Galia, I was going to take Kaya and run
into the clock tower.

“Kaya, I’ll trust you with the landing!”

“Oh, yes!”

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Fwooooo——!*

Immediately, I extinguished \[Frostfire\] and trusted our landing to
Kaya’s wind magic. We slowly approached the ground and finally landed
safely.

“I was so surprised…”

“That’s it. Follow me!”

“What? Oh!”

Luce was landing vertically while riding Galia.

Seeing that she was still chasing after us, I grabbed Kaya by the wrist
and ran into the clock tower.

All I wanted was enough time to have a conversation with Kaya. I needed
to clear up the misunderstanding with her before I could talk to Luce.

‘Ah.’

I forgot because I was in such a hurry. I was pretty strong and could
also run fast. If I clenched Kaya’s wrist this tightly while running, I
probably caused her a lot of pain.

I relaxed the grip slightly and turned back to look at Kaya.

“Sorry, Kaya! Are you okay?”

“I’m not okay, I’m happy!”

“What?!”

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Psychology:** \[The thought of getting forcefully
dragged by you is making her very excited.\]

***I swear I’m going to lose my fucking mind.***

<span id="0085_86_-_The_Battle_for_Isaac_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 86: - The Battle for Isaac (4)
======================================

**༺ The Battle for Isaac (4) ༻**

“Ah…”

Moonlight scattered through the stained glass ceiling and shimmered off
the walls.

The inside of the clock tower had a spiral staircase along the wall and
in every corner, there was a small space to hide inside.

I went into one of these cramped spaces with Dark Kaya and practically
plastered myself onto the walls.

I kept the story short and to the point. The demon, Malrog the Envious,
had created fabricated memories.

At first, Kaya couldn’t believe it.

“You’re lying right….? Aren’t you just making everything up out of
shame?”

She continued to be in denial, but when she saw how serious I was, she
began to break out into a cold sweat.

Predictably, she was left with a deep sense of skepticism.

“Sir Isaac’s words… They were all fake…”

I didn’t even do anything wrong, but I still felt kinda guilty.

How was I supposed to know the memories would be altered this way…?

For the record, I asked Kaya to pretend she didn’t know me during the
party to reduce as many variables as possible.

According to ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, all the heroines monopolized the
interest of men. Among them, there were plenty of cliched bastards who
would make unwanted advances.

The more unexpected variables I could avoid, the better. I had to fully
focus on defeating Marlog and that of itself was already full of
uncertainties.

Because of this, I didn’t tell Kaya anything…

***I do have some regrets. Maybe I should’ve at least told her about the
demons.***

It was all in the past so I couldn’t do anything anyway but…

“I’m sorry. I didn’t expect it to turn out like this.”

“If you’re actually sorry, you should reenact it in reality for me.”

Kaya spoke with a pouty face.

No matter how sorry I was, I honestly didn’t want to say any of the
embarrassing things I presumably said in her memories.

“…Well, I didn’t expect you to do it anyway. But it’s okay. I’m
satisfied just by being in this heart-pounding situation with you, Sir
Isaac.”

“I’m going to go out now. I need to talk to Lu-”

“Just a little more.”

Kaya gently grasped the wall next to my head as if telling me not to
leave.

Since our bodies were already in close contact, goosebumps appeared on
my body as all the soft parts of Kaya rubbed against me. I pressed my
body against the wall as much as I possibly could, trying to avoid
contact at all costs…

Kaya stuck her face towards me, seemingly ignoring my dilemma. Darkness.
The faint moonlight dimmed her face. As expected, there was a sly smile
that shadowed her entire expression.

“Let’s stay like this for a little longer, Sir Isaac.”

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Psychology:** \[Excited to be so close to you\]

It wasn’t like I hated it either. Moreover, after our cute Kaya took on
her dark personality, she was getting used to these expressions and
gestures of affection.

***I’ll be honest.***

‘I can’t refuse one of my favorite characters…’

***I’m about to lose my mind because of how cute she is…***

*Click—.*

Just then, the sound of heels echoed as someone stepped up the stairs.
Anyone could guess that it was the sound of Luce’s footsteps.

Just as planned, I managed to solve the misunderstanding with Kaya. Now,
all I needed to do was pacify Luce.

*Click—, Clack—.*

The sound of footsteps drew closer.

I pushed Kaya’s arms out of the way of my exit. She resisted, but when I
exerted more force and stared at her sternly, she blushed and eventually
gave in.

After escaping from such a cramped space, I stood on the stairs and
looked down.

At the bottom, a girl with rose-gold hair saw me and stopped climbing
the stairs as she shimmered in the moonlight.

It was obviously, Luce.

“Isaac…!”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Happy to see you.\]

Luce’s expression brightened for a moment, but then she took a quiet
breath to calm her emotions.

“She’s behind you, isn’t she?”

“Yes.”

Before I could even answer, Kaya popped out next to me.

Luce frowned for a moment, but eventually cleared her throat and
continued.

“I’m sorry I did something bad to her. However… I didn’t have a choice.
To be honest, she was out of line.”

“I wonder who did something that Sir Isaac wouldn’t like though? I’m the
one who helped Sir Isaac instead. Luce Eltania, don’t you think you’re
being too selfish and overbearing?”

“Isaac. You were surprised when she tried to kiss you out of nowhere
right? She even dragged you somewhere without consent.”

***What a mess… They’re both saying whatever they want without listening
to the other.***

No, it was a little different. Luce only looked and talked to me. She
didn’t even give Kaya a single glance.

It was a natural response since Luce never opened up her heart to
others.

Kaya frowned. She seemed to be displeased at Luce’s dismissive attitude
towards her.

“You should look at me when you talk. Are you ignoring me right now?”

“…”

As if she couldn’t hear anything, Luce continued to ignore Kaya.

I felt like I was going to get squashed between the auras of the two
women. I had to step up and stop their argument.

When Kaya tried to get another word in, I slipped my arm out in front of
her and stopped her.

“Sir Isaac?”

“Luce, Kaya. Thank you for cherishing me, but I have a partn-Ahhhk!”

*Chalala—.*

Colorful starlight mana swirled around me. I was dragged straight to the
top of the clock tower without being able to finish my statement.

*Hweeeeeee——!*

It felt like a new law of physics were established exclusively for me,
as if gravity was operating according to someone’s will. I was not able
to regain control until I reached the end of the spiral staircase, the
last floor with a large clock.

There was no need to be surprised. It wasn’t hard to figure out who
dragged me up here.

Luce and Kaya’s eyes widened in surprise. They leaned their heads out of
the railing to look up at me.

Far more mana than anyone else in this room stroked my skin like the
wind.

What appeared was a resplendent being surrounded by a cluster of
brilliant stars.

Lavender hair fluttered as she appeared in front of everyone’s sight.

“I was thinking it was taking too long for you to do your business. Why
were you getting yourself kidnapped while big sis wasn’t looking,
President\~?”

“Senior…”

Dorothy Heartnova asked with a smile.

When Luce summoned Galia, I already expected Dorothy to follow us.

Actually experiencing it, however, made it feel like it was Deus Ex
Machina.

“I know right…”

I let out a bitter laugh. I didn’t understand how things got to this
point either…

By the way, Luce’s eyes were frightening.

No matter how friendly Dorothy was to others, she wasn’t exempt from
Luce’s anti-social disorder.

“Senior Dorothy Heartnova…?”

Kaya, who was standing next to me, seemed to have figured out who the
woman with the lavender hair standing next to me was. As long as you
were a student at Märchen Academy, it would be harder to not recognize
Dorothy after seeing starlight magic.

“Let’s stop the silly pranks, girls. It’s quite rude to snatch someone
else’s partner, right?”

Kaya and Luce started to frown. The fact that I had a partner, and that
partner was Dorothy, seemed to have pissed them off.

Kaya and Luce were precious to me too. They were certainly people I
wanted to be with. However, Dorothy was my partner for today and I had
promised to hang out with her alone.

It was common decency to never go back on any promises you’ve made.

‘…What’s with this atmosphere?’

The air turned heavy. No one seemed to be willing to let me go without a
fight.

The pressure was sending shivers down my spine.

***What the hell should I do about this situation…***

More importantly, the fact that I am the center of this war of nerves
made it incredibly burdensome. Nevertheless, it was impossible for me to
run away from these three women.

‘What do I do?’

***Seriously, what am I supposed to do…***

Right when I was racking my brain for a solution.

“…!”

Another strong type of mana washed over my body. Due to of powerful mana
emanating from Dorothy, my perception was delayed.

Dorothy and I quickly turned around to see who it was.

“Why don’t you stop now?”

A graceful woman stood with her back against the moonlit clock.

A beautiful gold dress draped over her, matching exceptionally well with
her eloquently tied pale gold hair.

All her accessories were black and white, providing a stark contrast to
the gold of her dress. A flower hairpin with black and white checkers,
black and white earrings, and a black and white choker adorned her body.

Next to her, a fat purple cat with a small fedora tilted its head to
look at us.

The number one person I didn’t want to encounter…

***The Shadow of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.***

She let out a distinct seductive voice. Even in the moonlit night, her
eyes glowed a mesmerizing pale pink.

“After all, we’ll have to work overtime if you continue.”

One after another, students riding various familiars entered near the
clock as they stood behind the woman with pale gold hair.

Outfits suited for a formal event adorned all of them. However, the
silver brooch in the shape of a sword and grimoire differentiated them
from others. It was painfully obvious which organization they belonged
to.

The organization wielding the greatest administrative power in Märchen
Academy: The Student Council.

And the woman with pale gold hair was the one who had the greatest
authority among all of them. She was the Student Council President.

A woman whose information I could not read because of her unique trait
\[Red Queen’s Paradox\], thus making her an even more pronounced
existence.

It was the Student Council President, Alice Carroll.

<span id="0086_87_-_The_Battle_for_Isaac_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 87: - The Battle for Isaac (5)
======================================

**༺ The Battle for Isaac (5) ༻**

The Student Council President, Alice Carroll. Nicknamed, ‘Heart Queen
Alice.’

In Wonderland, she decapitated the Queen of Hearts and managed to seize
all her power and military assets.

Like several of the characters in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Alice was
inspired by the well-known fairy tale, ‘Alice in Wonderland.’

Alice was the Shadow of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, as well as the final
boss of the 「Alice Subjugation」 act.

She was a character that drew immediate interest and joy from all users,
while also being the very reason why I must hide my identity.

Alice was a strong advocate of evil. Therefore, Ian Fairytale, the
holder of the light attribute that poses the greatest threat to the Evil
God, would be nothing but an eyesore to her.

However, she couldn’t easily touch Ian because he was part of the
Fairytale Household. This was because of \[Fairy’s Protection\] that all
Fairytale household members have.

On the other hand, I was merely a humble commoner. I was an underdog who
couldn’t offer much more than feeble resistance against the behemoth
with a level in the 170s that was Alice.

‘I can’t believe it turned out like this.’

Honestly, I expected the situation to result like this ever since it
started growing out of control.

Especially since Dorothy was involved, it wasn’t strange at all for a
powerful existence such as Alice to appear.

“What’s up, Alice?”

“I’m here to clean up this mess.”

Dorothy asked with a bitter smile as Alice answered nonchalantly.

Alice approached me and Dorothy, staring at me with her
cherry-blossom-colored eyes.

While pretending to be slightly nervous, I tried to be as natural as
possible when we made eye contact. Honestly though, I didn’t even need
to pretend. I was actually very tense.

For reference, Alice doesn’t have a power like Dorothy’s \[All In the
World\]. Even if she stared at me with the intention to pierce through
my head, she wouldn’t be able to see anything suspicious about me.

***Anyway… I can’t believe that a female student who looks so cute and
kind can kill me whenever she desires.***

‘Please let this situation go by without a hitch…’

I begged desperately in my mind.

After a while, Alice nodded nonchalantly.

“I understand now.”

***Huh? What are you understanding?***

“Understand what?”

Dorothy asked for me as if she read my thoughts.

“I understand why you guys are fawning over this guy. He’s kinda cute.”

“Nihihihi, truly… Your habit of talking recklessly remains the same.”

Dorothy sneaked between me and Alice while smirking.

I agreed that Isaac looked decently attractive. Of course, there were a
lot of better-looking guys, but Isaac’s looks were not something to be
completely unacknowledged.

Furthermore, during the Trial of Frost, I discovered through the
Cheshire that I was Alice’s cup of tea. It was only natural that she
looked upon my appearance favorably.

“Enough of that for now.”

Alice glanced at Dorothy for a moment, then shifted her foot and looked
down at Luce and Kaya, who were seen below the railing.

“All right, since everyone’s here, I’ll get straight to the point.”

Alice straightened her back and put her hands behind her hips with a
peculiarly kind smile on her face.

Compared to her seductive voice, her smile was very warm.

“By the authority of the Student Council President. Dorothy Heartnova,
Luce Eltania, Kaya Astrea, and one other. All of you, please accompany
me to our student council.”

Alice gave orders in a friendly tone, mixing both honorifics and
informal language.

“Let’s end this fuss here.”

The order of the Student Council President put an end to the midnight
commotion.

\* \* \*

Blue bobbed hair curled like waves. A petite build. She was Ciel
Carnedas, the Class A third seat.

To her, Isaac was an unknown powerhouse.

She didn’t know whether he was a monster wearing human skin or a
next-generation Archwizard brimming with tremendous talent.

However, since it seemed obvious that he was protecting the academy,
Ciel wanted to be on his good side.

That was the only way she could safely graduate from Märchen Academy.
The last thing she needed was for the academy to be destroyed by
something akin to a natural disaster.

Therefore, Isaac’s actions were one of Ciel’s few interests in life.

Even if it was just listening to rumors and news about him.

It was safe to say that it was a big deal when she, who was usually
disinterested in her surroundings, consumed a lot of energy to pay
attention to him.

Since Ciel was that kind of person… It was very unusual for her to be
interested in a man and even chase after him.

‘This is…’

During the end-of-semester evaluation, Ciel witnessed the top seat and
the second seat defend Isaac.

And today, the confrontation between the two women over Isaac piqued
Ciel’s interest.

Luce, who tried to capture Isaac.

Kaya, who took Isaac from Luce.

Luce, who stopped Kaya when she tried to kiss Isaac.

Kaya, who ran away with Isaac.

Luce, who even summoned the Thunderbird to chase Kaya and Isaac…

‘Oh my God, this is so much fun…!’

How could anyone not want to watch this situation until its conclusion?!
It was like a K-Drama that came to life!

Ciel transformed her lightning bat familiar, Zabet, to its original
size, and secretly chased Isaac, Luce, and Kaya on his back.

She watched their chase from start to finish.

She also witnessed the appearance of the famous second year senior,
Dorothy Heartnova, who had danced with Isaac earlier.

***What a spectacular three-way confrontation between the strong women
who are competing for the mighty Isaac!*** Ciel was so captivated that
she couldn’t bear it. As expected, superior females are attracted to
superior males.

When she saw the student council entering the clock tower, she inferred
that the situation had blown out of proportion.

For a while, Ciel could not take her eyes off the clock tower.

Clearly… She found a new interest to pursue.

\*\*\*

“Dorothy Heartnova, Kaya Astrea, Luce Eltania, and Isaac. All statements
that were compiled for any relevant information have been concluded.
There seems to be no contradiction. Additionally, Dorothy Heartnova and
Rose Red Rivera will be referred to the disciplinary committee tomorrow
afternoon.”

“Okay, you did a great job.”

Bartos Hall, a palace-shaped building located in the heart of Märchen
Academy.

It was the place where the academy’s central administration was located,
as well as the student council room.

Moonlight shone through the curtains and dimly lit lamps, covered by
shades, softly illuminated the luxurious and elegant student council
room.

In the seat reserved for the Student Council President, there was a
woman with pale gold hair. She received a bundle of reports from Erin,
the Student Council Vice President standing beside her.

They came to Bartos Hall in the middle of a party, so they were still
dressed up.

“In the end, Dorothy caused an incident on the day of the social
gathering.”

“It was an excessive reaction, but it’ll be written as a normal one,
correct?”

“As far as Razel is concerned. Rose Red Rivera was also at fault so
we’ll see how it turns out.”

In truth, Alice Carroll was already convinced that Dorothy would get off
with a slap on the wrist.

Dorothy’s business value for Märchen Academy paired with the fact that
she reacted in self-defense to protect others would probably be taken
into account.

Dorothy, a rare genius who was blessed by the Lord Manhalla, was
expected to reach the level of an Archwizard within a decade. If one
considers the fact that she would receive a degree from Märchen Academy,
it wasn’t a far stretch to say that it was in the academy’s best
interest to be lenient with her even if it seemed unfair.

After all, the benefits of Dorothy merely existing in the academy were
enormous.

Thus, if Dorothy were ever to be severely punished, her image at the
Märchen Academy would be damaged in correlation. It would likely lead to
an immediate loss of investors.

It wasn’t something that the academy’s staff would ever want.

“More importantly, the problem is with Razel Red Rivera.”

Erin also reported on Razel Red Rivera. Currently, he was being treated,
but somehow he continued to shake with fear. He was unable to give a
testimony, it was as if he had been muzzled.

According to eyewitness accounts, he was fine even after he regained
consciousness from getting beaten by Dorothy… Now, it seemed that some
kind of trauma had settled within him.

“Perhaps there was additional damage from someone else…”

It was unclear whether anyone other than Dorothy had been involved, but
perhaps she was right. Furthermore, it was highly likely that Luce
Eltania was responsible for such additional damage. Perhaps it was a
personal vendetta.

Nevertheless, Alice did not care about such trivialities. It was her
creed to not dig up anything that wasn’t revealed on the surface.

“He was beaten by Dorothy, so I guess the trauma just hit him later.
Honestly, doesn’t it make less sense that he was fine at first?”

“I guess so?”

Alice took a sip of her tea and answered in a friendly tone.

Besides this, they also talked about the rest of the case regarding
Isaac, Luce, and Kaya. The Student Council released them immediately
after checking the facts. This was because there was no reason to hold
them captive.

“Well then, I’ll be leaving now.”

“You did great. Even with an event happening, you worked diligently.”

After seeing Alice’s smile, Erin’s heart melted. Even in the middle of
the night, Alice was as radiant as a goddess.

She was admired by all the students. Her voice was elegant, her smile as
warm as the sun. Her beauty was out of this world and to top it all off,
even her personality was excellent. She was utterly perfect. Even the
way she handled her work was flawless, making her almost inhuman despite
being the definition of human perfection.

Every time Erin saw Alice, she could not help but worship her.

“It’s nothing. The president has also worked hard. I’ll be taking my
leave now, have a wonderful night”

Erin smiled brightly while blushing and bowed to Alice before leaving
the student council room.

Silence now filled the room.

*Guooo——.*

Shortly thereafter, there was a flicker of ashen-colored mana, and a
purple cat appeared on the reception table.

\[Not a very fun ending, was it?\]

It was a fat cat with a fedora, the Phantom Cat Cheshire. He laid
sideways on the table, vigorously scratching his behind.

“What was?”

Alice asked without taking her eyes off the papers in front of her.

\[You know, about Dorothy. Don’t you think she only followed us
peacefully just because she was worried that other people would get
harmed? That was lame. Wasn’t it, Alice?\]

“If Dorothy truly resists, no one can stop her. We should be grateful.”

Alice held up a teacup containing steaming black tea without giving the
Phantom Cat a single glance.

For a while, the Phantom Cat stared at Alice and brought up another
topic.

\[…Alice. What do you think of the kid named Isaac?\]

Alice’s hands stopped for a very brief moment as she sipped her tea.

\[He was the one that the great Dorothy opened up to. Isn’t that
interesting? Also, that boy called out ‘Ice Element’.\]

“…You’re suspecting him aren’t you?”

\[Alice, I feel like everything is going according to the plans of the
‘disruptor’. You should suspect everything, even if it seems like
nothing. Don’t you think so?\]

“Because of the report about an informant, the academy’s staff is wary.
It’s best to not act rashly when even the Imperial Knights obtained such
information.”

Alice replied nonchalantly.

“And… I don’t think that the disruptor, who seems threatening even if I
were to summon every Paladin I had, would be such a weak man who is
guarded and swayed by others.”

According to a testimony given by Professor Fernando Frost in the first
semester, the Black Monster was an archwizard who could use nine-star
spells.

So even if Alice summoned all the powerful Trump Paladins under her
command, it remained to be seen whether she would be able to beat a
monster of such caliber.

On the other hand, how about Isaac, the silver-blue-haired man she saw
in the clock tower?

Beaten by Razel, protected by Dorothy, and swayed by women… He was too
weak for Alice to think her enemy, the overwhelmingly powerful Black
Monster, would be related to him in any way.

“In the first place, it’s wrong to use mere relationships as a way to
determine his identity. He looks like he’s fun to play with anyway. I
wouldn’t be surprised if Dorothy went into heat for him for that reason.
There’s nothing strange about it.”

Alice continued with a calm expression and drank her tea again. Alice’s
voice had her unique kindness, maturity, and calmness, but the content
was far from it.

The Phantom Cat raised himself as if he had heard something funny. The
corners of his mouth slanted into a unique grotesque grin.

\[Now that you mention it. Alice, don’t you want to try being in love?\]

The Phantom Cat lived for entertainment.

In fact, he followed Alice’s ambitions to end the world simply because
it seemed fun.

If he was able to see his master, who seemed sweet, but was pitch black
on the inside, in a relationship, it would be the best entertainment for
the Phantom Cat.

\[As long as Dorothy is enjoying her youth, Alice shouldn’t be left
behind right?\]

The Phantom Cat taunted Alice, desiring an entertaining reaction.

“…You’re saying some funny things.”

However, Alice answered without even taking her eyes off the papers as
if it wasn’t even worth thinking about.

Instead, she sipped some steaming black tea again.

\[You’re so lame…\]

With a look of boredom, the Phantom Cat drooped on the table, dejected
by Alice’s reaction.

Chapter 88: - Social Gathering Interlude
========================================

**༺ Social Gathering Interlude ༻**

─‘Senior, are you okay?’

─‘It’s a bit disappointing. I feel like I stepped in shit.’

I wrapped a coat around me and lit a \[Frostfire\] on my right hand for
some simple practice.

Even though the sun was bright in the sky, a slightly chilly wind blew
over me.

Lunchtime, corner of the butterfly garden.

I was sitting on the ground, recalling Dorothy’s words.

Dorothy was placed on probation for 14 days by the decision of the
disciplinary committee. It was a surprisingly light punishment.

It was possible because of the loopholes in the disciplinary system at
Märchen Academy.

Depending on the severity of the case, paying a certain amount of fines
gave the one punished an opportunity to lower the level of disciplinary
action. Luckily, Dorothy was given this option. The rationale was that
the act of protecting me was justified.

Although she must have been fined a fair amount, it would have been
chump change for her.

‘I knew this would happen.’

The power of capitalism transcends all bounds, even when it comes to the
decisions of the disciplinary committee.

It was obvious once one considered the mutual dependency between Dorothy
and the academy. If they showcased a transcendental genius unlike any
other attending their school as a marketing tactic, it was basically a
way to print infinite money. On the other hand, if she was severely
punished? The public image of Märchen Academy would suffer in proportion
to the severity of the punishment.

Investors were already pulling out because of the emergence of demons
and Headmistress Elena already had her knees worn out from endlessly
begging for their continued sponsorships of gel.

Given the abnormality of this situation, the academy had no choice but
to take a more passive attitude when imposing disciplinary action on
Dorothy. Dorothy’s punishment was already set in stone due to these
factors.

‘It’s honestly such a relief.’

Until the very end, Dorothy gave an energetic farewell, “See you next
time. I had a blast!” as she headed to the dorm with the academy’s
staff. It was a heartbreaking sight to see.

Even if it was a mere slap of the wrist, disciplinary action was still
disciplinary action. My heart clenched in guilt.

I couldn’t possibly show my face in front of her without repaying this
favor. When Dorothy’s probation was over, I decided to give her a
present as a token of gratitude.

The problem was that Dorothy wasn’t an official heroine. So there was no
heroine-specific item for her.

***I need to think about what gift I should get for her before she’s
released.***

By the way…

‘It really is frustrating.’

***I can’t believe my plan to hang out with Dorothy ended in disaster…
I’m so disappointed.***

Of course, it wasn’t like I hated the situation. Pretty girls fighting
over me? It was heaven on earth.

However, I really wanted to play with Dorothy deep into the night…

“Ugh, whatever.”

There was no point in lamenting the past. They all did it out of
affection for me, so it was hard to hate either one of them. I should
just think about Dorothy’s present instead.

And to my relief, there was never another encounter with Alice.

It would be an oversight to think that she had lost interest in me.
However, for now, she didn’t seem to think of me as the disruptor.

‘To be honest, I wouldn’t think so either if I was her.’

If one solely considered that situation, I was nothing but a weakling
who got dragged around by more competent girls.

I was way too lacking to ever be considered as the disruptor.

Either way, since I met Alice face to face, It wouldn’t hurt to be
cautious.

‘I think everything else has been resolved nicely.’

In the morning, I visited Mateo Jordana to talk to him. It was to
maintain as much of the distorted scenario as possible.

Ian, who had regained consciousness, did not know why the Cherubim’s
Necklace was hanging around his neck, so he tried to return it to the
Four Constellations.

However, after some discussion, the Four Constellations said that ‘the
treasure had found its owner and they were going to distribute it
anyways, so there was no need to return it.’

Ian was still skeptical about why the Cherubim’s Necklace chose him, but
I asked Mateo to gaslight him appropriately for me.

Next, I visited Eva Hielov, the one who sold my information to the Red
Elephant Constellation.

Among the Four Constellations, the members of the Red Elephant were
victims of Marlog’s illusion magic, thus influencing their minds to
accept him within their midst.

In other words, since Marlog was eliminated, the memories of the Red
Elephant members must have been altered. I wanted to see how their
memory changed.

‘Hieeek!!’

As soon as Eva saw me, she jerked backward in horror, landing on her
behind while screaming. The dolphin-like scream continued to ring in my
eardrums.

***Have I ever been this feared by someone?*** Usually, no one would be
afraid of a model citizen like me. It was certainly a new feeling.

Anyway, from what Eva told me, the members of the Red Elephant
Constellation didn’t lose their memories about Malrog being their head.

Instead, it was said that a parchment paper stating that he was
‘stepping down’ was written in Marlog’s handwriting and left in their
base of operations. However, no one seemed to know where this parchment
was.

‘Scarlett Atlas has safely returned.’

Scarlett Atlas was the previous head of the Red Elephant. It seemed that
she reclaimed her former position.

For reference, she was originally the middle boss of 「Act 5, Chapter 3,
Blue Wolf V.S. Red Elephant」 in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

How should I put it? Sometimes, there were extras who suddenly had a
backstory while fighting the main character. It was sort of like that.
***I’m sure she’ll face Ian sooner or later.***

‘The rumor has spread nicely as well.’

The rumors had spread among the students just like I had hoped. It was
all thanks to Dorothy, who destroyed Razel for me and declared me as her
partner.

This would create the perception that ‘Dorothy was on Isaac’s side, and
those who touched Isaac will not be able to escape her wrath.’

‘My favorite character couldn’t be more reliable than this.’

In addition, the perception that ‘Isaac was weak enough to need
protection’ spread at the same time, making me seem completely unrelated
to the Black Monster.

Instead of being worried that unwanted rumors about me would spread, I
decided to take the initiative and spread them myself. Dorothy was a
great help in achieving my purpose.

***Dorothy is a god and now, I am invincible!***

Additionally, strange rumors also began to circulate about me being the
incarnation of lust and flirting with any woman I could get my hands on.
It was the fault of the altered memories.

I decided not to worry about it because it was a one-off topic anyway.

Ironically, it wasn’t even a lie. ***I like harem.*** They were correct
to call me the incarnation of lust, so I had no intention of denying it
unless it adversely affected me.

I was just suppressing my desires until I got rid of the Evil God.

‘Anyway, I’m glad that everything else worked out just fine.’

I had one last thing to ponder.

‘When should I use this?’

I tossed up an old silver key in my left hand and caught it as it fell.

It was the ‘Key to Mysteries’. The loot I had I acquired by killing
Marlog the Envious.

\[Key to Mysteries\] A key embued with mysterious magic. It is used to
open the doors to a certain underground area. It can be used anywhere.

Rank: Tier 1

\[※Caution: Numerous deadly threats will target you upon use.\]

Although the words ‘underground area’ were used, it would be a mistake
to think of it as your average bunker.

‘Since that underground is actually the Nether.”

‘The Nether’.

It was obvious from the name, but it needs to be said…

***…The Nether is a fuuuuuuuuucking dangerous place.***

However, it was also a place where you can achieve tremendous growth if
utilized properly.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, after Ian used this key to fall into the
Nether, he practically threw an EXP grind party, killing all the enemies
who were aiming for his life.

If the player went whenever he wanted while being unprepared, he was
likely to experience a game over, and even if he managed to survive, the
growth efficiency would be low.

Upon use, the key would send you to the very edge of the Nether. It was
the most insignificant corner on the map.

I remembered the map and the situation because everything was just so
damn enjoyable. I had a lot of fun playing in the Nether during my
gaming days.

Additionally, after using the key, it disappeared after a certain period
of time.

If the user mimed the motion of inserting the key into a keyhole in the
air and turned it before actually using it, the power of the key would
cause the user that traveled to the Nether to return to their original
place. Only then, would the key turn into powder and disappear.

In other words, it was a consumable teleport scroll that only had the
form of a key.

As mentioned previously, since it moved the user to the edge of the
Nether, there would be virtually no chance of encountering horribly
strong creatures such as the ‘Nether King’ or the ‘Magic Beasts of
Incarceration’ who were refused salvation from both life and death.

‘If I ran into them, I would be done for.’

‘Anyway, if I use this now, I’ll only die a dog’s death.’

***After I get stronger, I’ll go on my own grind for EXP. I don’t need
it yet.***

Let’s call it a day. I should start doing some lunchtime training.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 76

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Freshman Who Has Adapted to Student Life

**Mana:** 9000/9000

– Mana Recovery Speed (B)

– Strength (B+)

– Intelligence (B-)

– Willpower (A+) \[Potential\] **Stat Points:**0 ◈ Growth Rate –

– Learning Efficiency (B+): 60/100 \[UP\] Owned Skills ❰❰Details❱❱
\[Unique Traits\] – Hunter – Weapon Master

Last night, 9 of the 18 stat points I earned from killing Marlog the
Envious were invested in \[Magic Training Efficiency\]. Thanks to this,
\[Magic Training Efficiency\] reached the highest level, and the unique
trait \[Weapon Master\] was born.

\[Weapon Master\] was a unique trait that helped to easily increase the
usage proficiency of magic weapons and even increase the power of magic
weapons.

There was a restriction where it had no effect on ultimate elemental
weapons such as Frostscythe, but it was still very effective when
wielding Zhonya’s Staff.

The remaining 9 stat points were invested into \[Physical Training
Efficiency\].

As mentioned previously, a strong body lends tremendous influence when
wielding ultimate elemental weapons such as the Frostscythe. This was
because the body had to be able to withstand the power of an ultimate
weapon.

In addition, when both \[Magic Training Efficiency\] and \[Physical
Training Efficiency\] reach the highest level, certain unique traits
could be obtained. One of these effects was the ability to apply the
unique trait \[Weapon Master\] to ultimate weapons.

Besides this, there were moments when exceptional physical abilities
were needed within the scenario.

I had to be prepared in advance.

I clenched my fist and snuffed out the \[Frostfire\], as I picked up
Zhonya’s Staff.

The lights of both sunrise and sunset harmonized as they lit up the mana
stone, while the staff made from the wood of a Sage’s Tree glistened. As
expected, the quality of Zhonya’s Staff was exceptional.

Immediately, I got up from my seat, held out Zhonya’s Staff, and let my
mana flow.

“As expected…”

I felt it last night and even this morning.

The flow of mana, which could not find its place within Zhonya’s Staff
just a week ago, became noticeably smoother.

This was the effect of the unique trait, \[Weapon Master\]. The beauty
of it almost brought tears to my eyes.

***Now, it’s time for some elemental magic.***

I pointed the head of Zhonya’s Staff forward to activate the spell
\[Frostfire\].

As such, an icy cold fire roared out.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Hwaaaaaah———!*

A fairly chilly fire bursted out. Kheuuu, I could only give praise every
time I saw its performance.

I was worried about when I could handle such a high-quality magic
weapon…

I started to feel ecstatic. I began to use even more elemental magic
with Zhonya’s Staff.

Every time I used magic, I automatically let out a “Wow”. I could
clearly feel that my \[Elemental Firepower\] and \[Element Efficiency\]
improved greatly!

“Wow…”

For a while, I was immersed in the lingering power of Zhonya’s Staff.

***This is better than seggs.***^1^TL Note: Author used ‘sex’ but as
Korean slang so we went with seggs.

\* \* \*

The vast sky was very clear with high tides rolling along the sea.

On the West Sea of the Zelver Empire, sturdy fishermen suddenly noticed
their shadows gradually lengthening.

“Uh, what? Suddenly, there’s a shadow…?”

“Hey, what’s that?”

“What is it, big brother? Why do you look so stiff all of a sud… de…”

The fishermen’s eyes were all drawn to one place.

They dropped their nets and harpoons, stunned at the sight before their
very eyes. Their jaws dropped.

Above the horizon, a mysterious island floated.

Under the vast sky, an unimaginably huge object floated in place,
engraving its figure into the minds of anyone who saw it.

“What… is that…?”

***It was a fortress.*** ***It was an island.*** ***It was the harbinger
of destruction.*** ***It was both heaven and hell.***

Once upon a time, in the distant past, it suddenly appeared in the sky,
destroying a country and its surrounding lands.

It soon disappeared, leaving its mark in the Zelver Empire’s history as
an ‘unknown mystery’.

Now, It had finally reappeared as it imprinted its presence on the wide
sky, covering the vast sea.

*Flooooo──────────.*

As if someone was playing a woodwind instrument, a strange sound filled
the world. It was akin to a cry that proudly announced its existence.

***The Floating Island.***

***It had reappeared in this world once again.***

Chapter 89: - Oh Luce... (1)
============================

**༺ Oh Luce… (1) ༻**

*Knock Knock—*

\[Breaking and entering! Trespassing! My master’s ability to abide by
the law is nowhere to be found!\]

“…”

*Ppak—!*

\[Bello, attacked! No violence! No violence!\]

It was the weekend, and the morning sun shined brightly on the trees.

It was quiet outside of the lower-middle-ranked student dorm, Briggs
Hall, and had no students roaming around.

A female student in a one-piece dress rode her larger than usual killer
whale familiar, Bello, as she peered into a specific window of Briggs
Hall.

Bello wrapped himself with translucent water mana as he swam in the air.
He was a familiar who could fly with a passenger as long as he was big
enough.

Luce Eltania, who was riding on top of Bello, whacked the noisy familiar
and peered through the window.

No one was there.

The window that was slightly opened for ventilation had no sounds coming
out of it. The owner of the room was probably not in the bathroom or
shower either.

‘I already checked that Isaac left to train earlier.’

In truth, she already knew that the room would be empty. However, she
double-checked just in case.

*Creak*.

Luce opened the window without hesitation and stepped inside the room.
She put the window back to its original slightly opened state.

“Ugh, it’s so damp…”

Due to Bello’s water mana, her entire lower half was soaked, including
her underwear. If only she rode on Galia, she wouldn’t have been in this
state.

On the day of the social gathering, after getting dragged away by the
Student Council, she was asked to avoid summoning Thunderbird Galia.

Although it was acknowledged that Galia was now docile enough to be
deemed safe, many students still had trauma from the terrifying
performance it showed in the end-of-semester evaluation.

As a result, she tested out riding Bello, but the drenched texture of
her dress and underwear only gave her discomfort. As expected, she was
never going to ride Bello again.

\[My master succeeds in breaking and entering! Crime perfe…!\]

Luce unsummoned Bello. As Bello’s voice faded away, a suffocating
silence filled the room.

In her hands were a small paper bag filled with cookies. It was
elegantly packaged with a letter taped to the bag saying,

**I’m sorry about last time**

– Luce

The letter even had a little drawing of a trendy character that she drew
after much effort. She wanted to emphasize the smiling face.

‘I don’t know if this will make Isaac feel better…’

She read from a book that an apology gift was best given when one
sneakily leaves the gift inside the recipient’s private space.

Luce decided to follow the book to the letter. The problem, however, was
that her method lacked both common sense and a willingness to follow the
law.

On the day of the social gathering, her plan was to forcefully restrain
Isaac. In the end, however, she achieved absolutely nothing. Fast
forwarding to the present, she was regretful of the risk she took since
the current state of her relationship with Isaac was in hot waters.

She had no guilt over her actions. After all, in her eyes, holding Isaac
captive was inevitable.

However, Isaac was her only friend, a person who was precious beyond all
measure. As such, she would rather die than be hated by him.

‘It would probably have a greater effect if I put it somewhere easy to
find, right…?’

The best location was probably the desk.

Luce’s plan was surprisingly meticulous.

1.  Leave the cookies in Isaac’s room.

<!-- -->

1.  After a long and exhausting workout, Isaac, who barely managed to
    drag himself into his room, would see the cookies with a note and
    be touched.

<!-- -->

1.  After deliciously eating the cookies, he’ll want to see Luce so
    badly that he will forgive her and, as a result, become even closer
    to her.

Now, all she had to do was leave the cookies and make her grand escape.
After she gave Isaac enough alone time to be touched by her gesture, he
would come to the conclusion that he should ‘forgive Luce and hang out
with her more.’ It was indeed a very meticulous plan.

“…?”

When she placed the bag of cookies on the desk, Luce noticed an
abundance of books and scrolls on the bookshelf. To be specific, the
scrolls were behind the books as if they were meant to be hidden.

The books were not a problem, but the hidden scrolls were plenty
suspicious. ***Why is he storing so many?***

These scrolls were meticulously written plans that Isaac had organized
ever since he first possessed his current body. They also contained
information about the future.

Every plan and every single piece of information needed to defeat the
Evil God of Destruction, Nephid, were stated in these scrolls.

The reason why Isaac had not disposed of these parchments was because
there was no guarantee that his memories would be maintained until the
very end.

The journey to defeat the Evil God was like a marathon. Without playing
the game for years at a time, it was fully possible for Isaac’s memory
to slowly blur and turn inaccurate.

As such, Isaac kept these scrolls and hid them behind the bookshelf.
However, it could not escape Luce’s sharp eyes.

“Isaac’s secret…”

She was sure that it was a pretty big secret.

Luce often saw Isaac catching glimpses of her. In conclusion, if he had
a healthy libido, the scrolls had to be…

‘It’s porn isn’t it?’

Luce smirked softly. He truly was a cute but perverted friend.

Honestly, she was curious as to what Isaac’s kinks and sexual
preferences were. As such, Luce took out the books that guarded the
scrolls and reached out to grab one of them from the back of the
bookshelf.

She untied the knot and opened the scroll to see what was written
inside.

With a single nonchalant action, Luce uncovered Isaac’s deepest secret.

“…What is this?”

Needless to say, it was not porn. More importantly, she didn’t even know
what it said in the first place.

Were these letters? A language that she had never seen before was
written neatly. It was organized and concise.

Even Luce, who read a lot of linguistic books, could not read a single
letter on the parchment.

‘Is this similar to an ancient language…? How does Isaac know an ancient
language?’

Hangul.^1^Editor’s Note: TL went with ‘Korean” but I’m changing it to
‘Hangul’ because it is in written form. Hangul is basically just written
Korean

It would be impossible for a person from this world, such as Luce, to
know this language.

At that moment.

*Stomp****—.***

Outside the door, footsteps could be heard.

Luce was so startled that she acted out of reflex, sealing the scroll
and placing it back in its original place. Her expression was utterly
calm as her hands moved at blinding speeds.

She could hear the footsteps in the hallway. It was incredibly close.

***These footsteps were…***

‘Isaac…!’

Isaac, the owner of this very room.

The reason why Luce could deduce this instantly was elementary.

It was because of the ‘stride’ of the footsteps.

Luce had already memorized the rhythm and sound of Isaac’s footsteps.

Not only that, simple things such as his body odor, the shape of his
irises, the traces of his palm line, the color of his skin, and the
thickness of his hair were obviously memorized as well. As such,
recognizing the sounds of his footsteps was child’s play.

It was already too late to summon Bello and escape through the window.

If she was caught here, Luce’s flawless plan would be in shambles.

Additionally, her relationship with Isaac was already shaky. Rather than
meeting him in person, she would rather secretly give him the cookies so
that he would feel better on his own.

***Was there anywhere to hide? There was no space under the bed. Why was
it designed this way?***

She continuously blamed the innocent designer as she scanned the room.

Isaac was almost in front of the door. There was no time to waste.

There were only three places she could hide in with the time she had
left: the closet, the shower, or the bathroom.

Luce broke out into a cold sweat as she ran into the bathroom while
holding the bag of cookies.

\* \* \*

***I really need to shit.***

Before going out to train, I decided that it was a better idea to take
care of my business in the morning.

Even though there were public bathrooms, it was a lot more comfortable
to use my own.

*Click.*

I opened the door and went into my room.

“…?”

***How do I put it… It seems the same as how I left it but at the same
time, it also feels out of place somehow.***

It was as if someone came and left… My brain was ringing alarm bells.

“Eh?”

It didn’t take me long to find the source of my discomfort.

The floor in front of the window was slightly damp.

There was no reason for any water to be there. It hadn’t evaporated yet
so it was recent. Therefore, someone had come into my room.

Since I was not gone for long, the intruder was probably hiding
somewhere in here. I was sure that they were just waiting for me to
leave.

If we were close with each other, there was no reason to break into my
room. In the first place, one of my acquaintances wouldn’t have hidden
either.

***Then who could it be?***

“…!!”

Suddenly, I felt chills run down my spine as goosebumps arose.

Alice Carroll, the Student Council President, came to mind.

Not only have I recently met her face to face, but there was also a
widespread rumor that I was under the protection of Dorothy.

As such, it was possible that Alice had come to investigate me.

‘If it’s Alice, wouldn’t she have sent one of her subordinates?’

I didn’t know why there was water on the floor, but I couldn’t think of
any other reason besides that.

When I opened the window to ventilate, I wedged a transparent piece of
paper between the windshields. However, it had all but disappeared.

This meant that someone had intentionally left the window ajar, just
like its original state.

There was no chance of Alice coming personally since her presence
emitted grandiosity that was lacking at this moment.

Thus, if Alice sent one of her subordinates to investigate me, it was
clear that they came to collect evidence that I was the disruptor.

‘They… had no choice but to hide when they heard me approaching.’

The pieces of the puzzle started to match together perfectly.

***Right now… Alice’s subordinate was in this room.***

I slowed my breath and tensed my body.

I took out the Sheath of Disaster while condensing my mana.

Concentrated ice mana swirled in my right hand, as I formed the magic
circle for \[Frost Explosion\].

I held the Sheath of Disaster in my left hand and prepared myself so
that I could immediately activate its effect on the intruder.

I determined that fighting was better than running away. There were
three reasons for this.

One: Alice wouldn’t be able to kill me so abruptly.

Two: I had more than enough justification to attack a trespasser.

Three: I was able to prove that I was significantly weaker than the
disruptor who was known as the Black Monster. Alice would hear this and
remove me from her list of potential disruptors.

In addition, if it worked out well, I had an opportunity to target Alice
using the academy itself.

As long as I stayed alive, I could reap the benefits of this unexpected
situation.

‘Now, where are you?’

***Alice made a big mistake. She never would have been able to guess
that I would come back early because of an urgent shit.***

I checked everywhere just in case they were hiding under the desk or
attached to the ceiling like a cockroach. However, they were nowhere to
be found.

I muted my footsteps and slowly approached the closet.

*Creaaaak—.*

***There’s no one there.***

***The shower room is next.***

*Creaaaak—.*

***They weren’t there either.***

***If so… the bathroom is next.***

I tried to swallow to moisten my dry throat. Behind this bathroom door,
Alice’s subordinate laid in wait.

The opponent was certainly… not a demon. Therefore, I have to fight in
my normal Isaac state.

“Hoo.”

I was ready to send two \[Frost Explosions\] with condensed ice mana in
my right hand and the Sheath of Disaster anytime I needed.

The first one to attack was the one to win.

I inhaled deeply and yanked open the door

“…”

“…Huh?”

***…For a moment, I thought my eyes saw incorrectly.***

I was so confused that the condensed ice mana in my right hand melted
away.

On the toilet, a student with rose-gold hair stiffly sat. As soon as the
door opened, she froze in surprise as her eyes trembled.

“…What are you doing here?”

“Um so… I came to give this…”

The girl sitting on the toilet was Luce as she meekly handed me a small
paper bag tied with a red ribbon.

When I took it and untied the ribbon, I saw that it contained
asymmetrically shaped cookies. It was obvious that it was made with
utmost sincerity.

“Oh, thanks. But, what are you doing here…?”

Luce dropped her head and chewed on her lips as if it was too
complicated to explain.

At that moment, I saw that Luce’s lower half was completely drenched.

***I may… have made a mistake.***

“Never mind, I’m sorry…”

I closed the bathroom door quietly and stood there without letting go of
the handle.

Behind the door, the silence was so pronounced that it felt suffocating.

***I don’t know what happened… But there are some taboos in life that
are better off being left unknown.***

***I think I witnessed one of those taboos…***

Chapter 90: - Oh Luce... (2)
============================

**༺ Oh Luce… (2) ༻**

I lent Luce some of my clothes.

She took off her wet one-piece and underwear as she changed.

All of this happened so naturally that it seemed planned.

I didn’t question her about what happened since I believed that it was
the right thing to do as a moral human.

Time passed as we reached the current circumstances.

Luce sat on my bed and quietly surveyed my room.

After handing the trespasser a teacup filled with black tea, I held my
own cup and sat on my desk chair.

She was currently in a white uniform shirt and pants, which I had lent
her.

Because it was for males, the sleeves were so long that it covered her
hands.

“This is my first time in Isaac’s room. It’s a lot cleaner than I
thought it would be.”

As if she was waiting for an opportunity to speak, Luce’s beautiful
voice rang out.

How natural of her. If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve thought she
was an actual guest who was properly invited into my room.

I squinted hard at her with stern eyes.

“You know you aren’t supposed to come in here right?”

“Um so, I had my own plan of action when I was preparing to come here…”

***I would have just called it a surprise.***

From the paper bag, Luce gave me earlier, a letter was also given. The
words, \[I’m sorry about last time – Luce\] were written on it so I
could infer why she sneaked into my room.

“But more than anything, I wanted to apologize to you.”

Luce’s eyes shone with determination.

***As expected, this was her goal.***

Obviously, I understood her determination. Ever since she closed her
heart from others, she had never properly apologized to anyone.

What’s more, this was the first time she approached me with the
intention to apologize. She must have prepared a lot in her own way.

I took a sip of the black tea.

“Is this because of the fiasco during the social gathering?”

I recalled Luce placing handcuffs on my wrists.

“Yes… I did the very thing you told me you hated.”

“At least you remember. Well, go ahead.”

“I don’t know if this will make you feel better but…”

Although I replied coldly, I couldn’t wait to happily talk with Luce
again.

Even so, I couldn’t treat Luce kindly just in case she determined that
there was no reason to apologize anymore.

I didn’t want to disregard her determination. As such, I maintained my
cold attitude.

***I’ll receive her apology graciously. In reality, I’m older than her,
and as a more mature person, I should calmly and serenely accept her
with a heart as warm as the sun.***

And as we finish this conversation with laughter…

‘I should ask her to spar with me.’

I wanted to put Zhonya’s Staff to the test.

Although Luce was an overwhelmingly powerful opponent, I needed someone
like her to measure my progression. I was sure that the spar would also
help me improve myself.

I sipped some black tea as I quietly lent an ear to what she was saying.

***“Do you want to touch my breasts?”***

*Puhuk—-!*

I spat out my black tea.

***Is she crazy…?***

“Is your mental state okay…?”

I coughed as I asked her carefully.

There was no way I heard it wrong. Luce’s voice had this mystical
ability where even the softest of whispers drew the focus of others on
her. It was to the point where every single word that she spoke was
stuffed down one’s ears, rendering them incapable of focusing on
anything else.

Even if Luce didn’t know where to draw the line between friends, she
should’ve at least had adequate sex education.

Luce’s head drooped and her cheeks turned red. She knew what she said.
She knew what exactly it implied. There was absolutely no doubt about
that.

“But the book said guys love it if I said this… Nevermind. I’m sorry.
Forget about it please.”

“How could I for…?”

“Forget about it!”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Currently extremely embarrassed.\]

Her voice was so delicate that even her shouting sounded like scattering
moonlight.

‘Oh, Luce…’

My hand automatically slapped my forehead.

I have never seen such a disordered Luce. I could see without a doubt
that she was anxious on the off chance I actually hated her.

***To confess, I have often shot glances at Luce’s chest. It can’t be
helped, just look at that sinful voluptuousness. As a man, her cleavage
rightfully deserved my absolute worship.***

Luce probably knew about my glances since she had already called me out
as a pervert before.

‘Even so, how could you say that without any hesitation…’

Even though Luce immediately regretted what she said…

***This isn’t going to work. It’s more efficient for me to step up right
now***

“Anyway, you’re trying to apologize to me, right?”

Luce nodded her head.

“Then let’s spar. That will be enough for me to forgive you. Is that
okay?”

“…!”

Luce’s ocean-blue eyes came back to life. She nodded furiously.

It would’ve been so much easier to do it like this from the start.

\*\*\*

The academy’s streets were quiet during the weekend morning. The
majority of students were honing their skills in various facilities
across the campus.

As usual, no one was in the corner of the butterfly garden.

*Kwang—-!*

*Fuaah—-!*

For hours, Luce and I exchanged elemental spells.

Even with Zhonya’s Staff, the power of my spells couldn’t be compared to
Luce’s.

Unless I used every scheme and strategy I had, there was no way to
resist Luce’s overwhelming might.

Afterward, we decided to rest and eat lunch together. We sat together
underneath the shade of a tree as we cooled ourselves and quietly
collected our breaths.

“You’re amazing Isaac. You can already handle the staff. It hasn’t even
been that long since you started to wield it.”

Luce complimented me as if she were reciting a dictionary. Of course, I
knew she was being sincere with a simple use of \[Psychological
Insight\]. Even this could be considered an improvement compared to the
first semester as her tone became more natural.

I had to put in a considerable amount of time and effort in order to
properly use a staff like this. However, thanks to my unique trait
\[Weapon Master\], I was able to easily wield Zhonya’s Staff. Since I
had already told Luce the difficulties of utilizing Zhonya’s Staff,
wouldn’t she think of my progress as brilliant talent?

“Isaac must work really hard to improve this quickly.”

“How am I compared to the first semester?”

“If you were an ant then, now you are… closer to a mouse?”

“…”

***Isn’t she being way too honest…***

Even though it was noon, the wind was chilly. I thought it would be warm
because of the sunlight shining down.

“You look cold.”

I wrapped the coat I was wearing around Luce who only had a thin uniform
shirt on. She stared at me intensely.

“I’m wearing a bunch of Isaac’s clothes today. My body is going to smell
like Isaac.”

Luce must’ve been happy because she couldn’t stop smiling and giggling.

***She’s hella cute.***

“Hey, Isaac.”

“Yeah?”

“When I physically restrain you, do you hate it that much?”

I thought we were already done with this conversation.

“I’ve already told you how much I do”

“Then…”

Luce extended her arms towards me.

“Do you want to try tying me up instead?”

***…Pardon?***

“It’s like… revenge for you. I was also curious as to why Isaac hated it
so much. Also, I feel like this problem can be completely resolved if we
do this…”

Was this what she was contemplating about during our spare? It was
obvious that she suggested this after careful consideration.

I didn’t think much of it… But Luce must have assumed that I was still
bitter about the restraints.

***For me, if this action can ease Luce’s mind, I’m obviously all for
it. In the first place, I was already planning to teach her to put
herself in other people’s shoes.***

“…I’m really going to do it okay?”

“Sure, you can do it as much as you want.”

There was no need for hesitation. I rose from my seat and sat down on
one knee in front of her.

I grabbed Luce’s wrists and yanked them up her head.

Even with such slender arms, Luce did not reject my grip.

“Ah.”

Due to the close proximity of our faces, I could see Luce gulp. She
seemed inwardly nervous.

“I don’t have any rope to tie you with, so I’m just going to use
elemental magic okay?”

Luce nodded carefully.

After bringing her wrists together, I let my mana flow.

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」

*Koong–.*

I handcuffed Luce’s wrists with my rock magic.

*Koong–.*

I also cuffed Luce’s ankles together in a similar manner.

Even though Luce could have easily freed herself with her water magic,
she did not show any resistance.

She just stared deeply into my face with an indiscernible expression.

I placed Luce’s cuffed arms behind her head and looked down at her from
a close distance.

***This pose… is more dangerous and seductive than I expected.***

With that thought in mind, I solely focused on her face.

Her delicate features were lovely. However, this wasn’t the time to
enjoy the beauty of one of my favorite characters.

“Isaac, your face is too close.”

Luce suddenly blushed with a soft smile. Like before, I adopted a
relaxed attitude, but this time, I was not going to get embarrassed and
move away.

“Luce.”

“Yes…”

“You can’t move as you want right? This is what you did to me. This is
what I hate.”

Like a teacher lecturing a student, I spoke clearly with a kind voice.

However, I put on a slight frown and donned a serious expression. I was
confident it would have an effect on Luce, who couldn’t stand being
hated by me.

“Do you understand what it’s like to not be able to move your body as
you please? What it’s like for another person to control your body?”

Luce pursed her lips and contemplated quietly.

After a moment, she gently licked her lips in preparation for what she
had decided to say.

“…Honesty, it’s not too bad.”

As if she found a new toy, she seemed joyful with a childish glint
shining in her eyes

With a gentle smile that she only reserved for me, Luce softly
whispered.

“If I do this, will Isaac take care of me every day?”

Her voice tickled my ears as its destructive beauty bordered on abuse.

“Something like that… doesn’t sound so bad.”

\[Luce Eltania\] **Psychology:** \[Wants you all to herself.\]

‘Huh?’

An ominous feeling settled within me as she appeared to learn a very
different lesson compared to my original intentions.

I felt a sense of danger as soon as I realized this new kink of hers was
about to combine with her numerous questionable habits that already
existed.

A drop of cold sweat trickled down my cheek.

<span id="0090_91_-_Dorothys_Return.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 91: - Dorothy's Return
==============================

**༺ Dorothy’s Return ༻**

“President! Big sis is back!”

***WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! YEEEEEEEAHHHH BABBBBYYYYY! THAT’S WHAT I’VE BEEN
WAITIN’ FOR, THAT’S WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOO!!!***

“It’s been a while, Senior Dorothy.”

I couldn’t help but smile as I saw Dorothy return from probation. As
expected of my number one favorite character, her beauty practically
radiated with starlight.

A lot of things have happened over the past few days.

On the day I tied up Luce, I witnessed her shady habits start to combine
with her newly found interest in real-time. As it began to develop into
a terrifying hybrid of kinks and hobbies, I quickly released the
restraints and tried to distract her with lunch. Afterward, the topic of
bondage never came up again, however, I continued to remain vigilant.

A few days ago, 「Act 5, Chapter 3, Blue Wolf V.S. Red Elephant」 of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was successfully concluded. I was able to
confirm this through the use of \[Clairvoyance\].

Just like how I remembered it, a Red Elephant member picked a fight with
a Blue Wolf member, pummeled him, and a conflict broke out between the
two Constellations as a result.

This was because the head of the Red Elephant, Scarlett Atlas, used this
opportunity to add fuel to the flames, claiming superiority over Blue
Wolf.

As a result, all Blue Wolf members, including Ian, broke into the Red
Elephant’s base and engaged in combat. They eliminated their enemies as
they climbed up floor after floor.

As expected of that PVP fanatic, Ian didn’t faint when he fought against
students. That was a relief. In the end, even the head of Red Elephant,
Scarlett Atlas, was eliminated, leading to the end of the \[Act 5,
Chapter 3\]. Chapter 4, where Heinkel the Hoarder appears, was omitted.

Sometime soon, I need to prevent the extra bad ending No.8 「Frog」 that
occurred in the joint practical evaluation. Compared to the difficulties
I had experienced up til’ now, I should be able to resolve it with my
eyes closed.

In the middle of Josena Forest, the autumn sky was clear and the
surrounding trees were colored with red maple leaves.

Dorothy came to my hideout using the invitation I had given her. It was
the place I brought Amy to during the childhood friend kidnapping case.

“Nihihi, President. I came with high expectations today okay? Now then,
quickly satisfy this big sis of yours\~!”

Dorothy placed her hand on her chest while huffing in excitement. It was
painfully obvious she was giddy with joy.

Today, I prepared presents to celebrate Dorothy’s return. Let’s start
with the first one.

I approached Dorothy and tucked a purple flower into her witch hat. It
was a flower that never withers thanks to the enchantment imbued into
it.

“A flower? Huh?”

As I drew closer, she let out a surprised expression.

“Oooh, what is this? Did you get taller?”

“I’ve always been growing. You must’ve only noticed because you haven’t
seen me in a while.”

“Hehe. President, are you going through puberty?”

“Aren’t I a bit past that age already…”

I replied in a tone of disbelief as Dorothy covered her lips with her
mouth and smiled teasingly.

As Dorothy said, I was growing quickly like a teenager going through
puberty, maybe thanks to \[Physical Training Efficiency\]. It was a late
growth spurt.

For reference, I was 170cm during the first semester and now I am
approaching 180cm. My growth would probably stop once Isaac reached his
maximum height.

I stepped away from Dorothy and glanced at her face. The purple flower
matched quite well with her witch hat.

“It looks good on you.”

“Okay, I’ll trust the President’s taste. Thanks!”

Dorothy smiled brightly.

“What’s next?”

I sat Dorothy on an outdoor table and brought out a croissant from a
picnic basket.

Dorothy tilted her head and looked at me with a questioning gaze.

“When I worked as a carriage driver, there was a bakery near the
commercial district. I became friendly with the lady working there.”

“And?”

“Apparently, she is from Regel.”

“Hmm.”

She must have realized my intention as a slight smile adorned her face.

“Just think of it as a light snack.”

Every little thing that Dorothy said she wanted to do with me was stored
in my head. One of those was going to Regel and eating their famous
croissants.

I poured some warm coffee I prepared beforehand into a cup and gave it
to Dorothy.

Dorothy giggled as she took the cup I gave her.

The croissant crumbled as I stabbed it with a fork and brought a piece
towards her. With a cute ‘Ahh’, she was happily fed by me.

“How is it?”

“It’s delicious but not as special as I thought it would be. As
expected, we should travel to Regel, dip one in chocolate, and feed me
another.”

“Here you go.”

“Hap. It’s delishus\~.”

After finishing the croissant, we went inside my hideout.

“Oooh!”

Within the hideout, there was an area lavishly decorated for a party.
Its small size only made it look more gorgeous.

On the wall, there was even a banner that said,

**Congrats to Dorothy for Her Return!**

It was my masterpiece that I poured my heart and soul into.

The present that I gave Dorothy was a ‘home party’. I decided that the
present didn’t necessarily need to be materialistic.

By the way, I didn’t decorate all this by myself. I gasli-, I mean
convinced Mateo Jordana to help. In front of him, I pettily thought ‘Now
that I think about it, I saved your ass during the first semester… Have
you paid me back yet?’ I then requested him to decorate the hideout with
his lackeys.

To my relief, Mateo must have felt guilty for repaying his life debt
with something so trivial and was happy to help.

“Teehee, I’m a bit touched!”

“I’m relieved that you like it so much.”

“It feels like a continuation of the social gathering that I missed.”

“It’s a bit lacking comparatively though.”

Dorothy tilted her head as she smiled sheepishly at me with flushed
cheeks.

“No, I like this better. I like everything about it.”

A sense of relief flooded into me as I saw her happy smile. I guess it
was worth it to enslave Mateo and work him to the bone.

Afterward, we continued our small celebration.

We popped confetti as Dorothy used a gentle breeze to strike a stunning
pose.

We ate cake while sharing fun stories.

We played simple games.

We even used magic instruments to play songs and we sang along excitedly
as if we were doing karaoke. Since I didn’t know the songs of this world
that well, I could only hum and dance to the music.

Dorothy’s wind magic blew the shining confetti into the air and a
cluster of beautiful stars completed the decorated space.

Dorothy continued to let loose in this joyful atmosphere. I also got
carried away and started to perform a rain dance. Dorothy, seeing this,
burst into so much laughter that she was practically in tears.

“…”

While all of this was happening, I secretly lit \[Frostfire\] on my
finger repeatedly. It was a technique to train my mana mastery.

Even if my aim today was to make Dorothy have fun, I could not be lazy
with my training. Honestly, even in this joyful atmosphere, there was a
small nagging feeling of impatience in the back of my mind.

‘There isn’t much time left.’

Heinkel the Hoarder was supposed to fight Ian in 「Act 6, Chapter 2,
Decisive Battle」, but I had already eliminated him.

Leafa the Illusive, who was supposed to backstab Ian as the final boss
of 「Act 6, Chapter 3, Fictional Hell」, was also defeated by yours
truly.

That only left the Floating Island. Within two months, that bastard
would arrive.

I heard the news that it first appeared in the West Sea of the Zelver
Empire. Apparently, when the empire tried to send an expedition against
it, it suddenly disappeared.

‘It’s about time for it to start to show itself.’

***The Floating Island. The entire island flying overhead was but a
singular demon.***

It was the one responsible for cursing Dorothy and it had a base level
of 190. In the first place, it wasn’t a demon meant to be beaten. Act 6,
Chapters 1 and 2 were the only main stages with combat.

Moreover, Dorothy would be absorbed by that bastard. Her curse would
accelerate and she would be incapacitated.

***I won’t be able to expect her assistance at all.***

In \[Act 6, Chapter 1\], the Floating Island created a huge magic
circle. After the time limit expired, the magic circle would be casted,
vaporizing a part of the sea and a tenth of the imperial territory. This
included the island where the academy was located.

To prevent this, Dorothy sacrificed her life to activate the ultimate
starlight magic \[Last Light of a Dying Star\], resulting in the
Floating Island accompanying her in death. With this last act, Dorothy’s
smile glowed like stars in the night sky before losing her light.

I had seen it countless times.

***While everyone called that heartbreaking scene a so-called
masterpiece, I fucking hated it.***

***After letting go of her life’s last lingering attachments and saving
everyone with her sacrifice, Dorothy died a hero as a content smile
lingered on her face.***

In my eyes, however, she was a truly pitiful person who had her heart
utterly broken throughout her entire life.

There wasn’t a way to save Dorothy in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ even if
the player wanted to. If she didn’t sacrifice herself, there was no one
else that was capable of defeating the Floating Island.

***Dorothy’s death was already set in stone.***

─‘President, there’s something I wanna try.’

***And I am going to be the one to crush that very stone into a fine
powder.***

Compared to the difficulty of my dream, the life-threatening danger I
experienced when fighting Galia was virtually negligible. However, I was
determined to succeed.

***If ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was truly my reality now, I can’t lose
Dorothy. She’s someone who holds immeasurable worth to me.***

“President, Why did you suddenly get quiet?”

I unintentionally fell into deep contemplation.

Dorothy approached and stuck her face close to me while asking. With her
witch hat off, her stunning face filled my sight.

Her teasing smirk and voice remained unchanged.

I was startled for a moment, but it wasn’t hard to regain my composure.
I answered slyly while pointing at my ear.

“It’s nothing much. I was just entranced by your enchanting voice and
lost my train of thought for a moment.

“Nyahaha, flattery huh? I wasn’t asking you to tell me something so
obvious.”

The floating confetti scattered onto the floor and the cluster of stars
died down.

“I was curious because you looked like you were suffering by yourself.”

Dorothy gave me a meaningful smile.

“You don’t have to suffer alone, you know?”

Her voice was subdued as she stepped away from me.

***What kind of weird things is she saying? I can’t understand the
meaning behind her words…***

I just assumed that she was willing to listen to my troubles, so I asked
Dorothy.

“…Should I share my worries with you?”

“It’s okay as long as it’s the President. Ah, relationship problems are
difficult though. This big sis has never dated someone after all!”

I didn’t think it was something to be so proud of to the point of giving
me a thumbs-up.

“I’m just worried about my future career.”

“Nevermind then, that’s boring so let’s skip that.”

She killed the mood in an instant.

Fake laughter naturally flowed out of me. It was just like Dorothy to
say something like that.

“Whatever, never mind that. Senior, how was today?”

“Reaaally satisfying. It was worth getting the punishment, Nihihi.”

Dorothy stroked my hair.

“I’m so proud. As expected, I made the right choice when I chose you as
my fan. Thank you, President.”

I couldn’t read Dorothy’s true thoughts because her starlight mana
blocked \[Psychological Insight\].

However, I could easily tell that her smile was sincere even without
using it.

***Just like this, we fully enjoyed our party of two.***

***It was one of the happiest moments of my life.***

\* \* \*

**Dear Eve Rophenheim,**

How are you, Eve? It’s your soulmate, Alicia!

As I’ve told you before, the Academy has been swamped with incident
after incident while you were away!

This time, a demon appeared on Elt Island. Isn’t that crazy? I don’t
feel comfortable even with the protection of the Imperial Knights. I
don’t know what the academy is thinking. Ah, the demon in Elt Island was
killed by the Black Monster so don’t worry\~.

Also… There are quite a few people dropping out lately. Even though it
was hard to get enrolled, if I’m being honest, the situation is pretty
scary these days. I understand why they would want to drop out. But
whatever. I’m sure it’s all going to work out, right? I mean, even the
imperial family has stepped in.

Anyway, that’s enough doom and gloom!

I have some fun news!

Dorothy Heartnova brought a partner to the social gathering! But Razel,
that unlucky idiot, tried to harm Dorothy’s partner! He was utterly
destroyed by Dorothy. Honestly, you should have seen it. It was scary
but funny at the same time.

But you know, Dorothy’s partner looks really similar to you! At least
the hair color and eyes do. It’s not like your looks are common either.

Do you actually have a hidden younger brother?

Hehe, I’m just kidding! I guess you’ll be back soon. I have a lot of
stories to tell you, so stop by to see me as soon as you get here!

Bye then!

-Sincerely, Alicia Armint.

There was a specific system for second and third years at Märchen
Academy.

After taking a leave of absence from the academy, they joined various
organizations such as the Academy Support Guild or the Magic Tower for a
while to experience practical work. It was similar to an internship
system. The competition was fierce as it was a rare opportunity to gain
practical experience under experts as an academy student.

Today marked the return of several students who had left the academy to
gather half a year’s worth of practical experience

One carriage arrived at the academy’s main gate.

From the carriage, a female student grabbed her bags and carefully
stepped off.

A catlike face with pale skin as white as a sheet of snow. The sunlight
made her pretty features shine as she supported herself with her magic
staff.

The autumn wind lifted her long silver-blue hair as the silver earring
on one of her ears shook.

Eve Rophenheim tied up her bothersome hair with a white snowflake
hairpin as her red eyes glanced at Märchen Academy.

Contrary to the many unfortunate incidents that swept up this place, it
looked quite peaceful.

“Devon, let’s move our luggage.”

Near Eve, pale blue mana clumped together into an ice element white
tiger familiar as Devon’s form manifested.

─Do you actually have a hidden younger brother?

Eve recalled the letter that her friend, Alicia Armint, sent.

Younger brother. Just hearing those words made her memories pass by like
a panorama, despite wanting to forget them. These memories contained
slivers of a silver-blue-haired boy.

They were memories of a six-year-old child smiling innocently while
showering Eve with pure affection.

***─‘Sis, what are you doing?’***

***─‘Look at this, sis. I drew our family!’***

***─‘Sis… It hurts, heung!’***

***─’You’re so cool, Sisl! How are you so good at magic?!’***

***─‘Sis is the prettiest in the world after our mom!’***

***─‘Sis, I’m scared of thunder… Let’s sleep together…’***

***─‘Sis is a god and I am invincible!’***

***─’Mommy, I want to be like my sis when I grow up!’***

***─’This bread is mine! I can’t give it to you even if you’re sis…!
I’ll give you half.’***

***─‘If I work hard, can I use magic as good as sis?’***

“There’s no way…”

Eve murmured in a low voice as she hastened her steps.

The joint practical evaluation was rapidly approaching.

<span id="0091_92_-_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 92: - Joint Practical Evaluation (1)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (1) ༻**

“You defeated Helga the Two-Headed Dog? Even during that unexpected
situation?”

“I mean\~, the guild members helped a lot. All I did was throw a few
\[Ice Spears\] when that mutt was stunned.”

“You can’t be judged by the standards of a student anymore! That’s
incredible…!”

Eve Rophenheim loved it when people put her on a pedestal.

It was daytime. Eve was listening to Alicia excitedly complimenting her
while they sat on the terrace of Hailey’s Bakery, a location on Märchen
Academy’s grounds.

Eve acted like it was nothing for her as she smirked and added more to
her story.

“It really was nothing much. If you were in the same situation as me,
you would’ve done just as well, you know?”

“That’s impossible. It was only possible because it’s Eve.”

***That’s exactly right.***

Eve looked at Alicia with sharp eyes, as she inwardly agreed.

“By the way, what did you do with the two-headed dog? Aren’t her horns
worth a lot of money? You definitely sold it right?”

“That’s… a secret, but just between us, it became my familiar.”

“Ehhhh?! Isn’t that crazy?!”

“Shush.”

“Ah, I’m sorry. But, how…?”

“She wanted to follow me. I must have left a deep impression on her when
we fought.”

Eve shrugged her shoulders as if it were no big deal.

“Oh my god! Could you try summoning it?!”

“That’s a bit difficult. She’s still hard to control. And the amount of
mana required is crazy…”

“Since it’s a magic beast, that makes sense. But, for you to have a
two-headed dog. That’s so cool…!”

“No, I still have a long way to go. I need to work harder. Later, the
guild said that they may even scout me…”

“To even get scouted…That’s crazy!”

Alica had a dumb but innocent smile. She didn’t doubt a single word that
Eve said.

“You’re so cool, Eve… I want to be like you someday.”

A look of worship filled her eyes. Alicia’s words gave Eve an ecstasy
beyond all materialistic pleasure.

\*\*\*

The middle to top-ranked students’ dormitory of the girls’ wing, Elma
Hall. The night was pitch-black.

A bright lamp on a desk illuminated the room.

A book opened for studying was shoved into the corner of a desk where
Eve sat as she hummed and drew on a piece of parchment.

Helga the Two-Headed Dog. Eve Rophenheim, the silver-blue-haired beauty,
who fought with her colleagues to take down this demon.

In combat, she was the greatest driving force.

And in the end, Helga the Two-Headed dog, bowed before her and begged
for her permission to follow her.

***It was what the picture she drew looked like.***

And all of it was nothing more than a fantasy that never came to pass.

Although she told Alicia that the demon ambushed them, in reality, she
didn’t even see any demons or demonic creatures. It was just a made-up
story.

In the first place, what kind of guild would take a student to dangerous
remote areas when their purpose was merely practical experience?

Alicia was a naive girl. She was perfect as a tool meant to boost Eve’s
mood and ego while attending the academy.

Besides Alicia, there were plenty of second year students who sucked up
to Eve. They admired and complimented her beauty, skill, and experience.

***They only knew as much as their eyes could see.***

Anything they didn’t see personally was up to Eve’s vivid imagination.
It didn’t matter whether it was true or not. Her idealized version of
herself in a made-up story would become the truth.

Ever since she entered Märchen Academy, Eve had survived in this strong
eat-the-weak environment by lying to make herself look better than she
actually was.

As the students’ admiring eyes gave Eve increasing pleasure, the purpose
of her lies gradually changed.

It came to the point where even her childhood was filled with lies.

However, it wasn’t like Eve’s true self was unknown by everyone.

–‘Do you actually have a hidden younger brother?’

Eve’s hand stopped while she was drawing.

Younger brother. She did have one once.

Eve moved her hand again as she drew a boy’s face. It was a boy with
tousled hair and a cute look on his face.

‘There’s no way he’s here.’

That unskilled younger brother without any talent whatsoever couldn’t
have possibly been accepted into Märchen Academy. There was no point in
even trying to confirm whether it was true or not.

Well, no matter how much effort he put into getting accepted, it would
be like a sheep walking into a lion’s den. This dog-eat-dog academy
would eat him alive.

Eve let out a bitter laugh.

\*\*\*

‘Why is he here?’

Eve was as pale as a corpse.

Right in front of her eyes, her younger brother stood before her.

\*\*\*

“The joint practical evaluation will now begin.”

Märchen Academy used an entire island as its campus, thus the
utilization of its terrain was endless.

Like this canyon, for example.

It was a sunny day. The first and second years of the Magic Department
stood in an orderly fashion as they looked towards Professor Fernando
holding a loudspeaker in front of them. As with any large-scale exam,
behind the students were a group of proctors, professors, assistants,
and imperial knights.

The place where I stood was the huge canyon, “Machea Ravine”. Just like
how it was portrayed in the game, it was a place that boasted a majestic
grandeur. The joint practical evaluation was scheduled to be conducted
here.

The first and second years were divided into three groups and sent to
different starting lines while listening to the professor’s explanation
regarding the exam. I couldn’t see Luce and Dorothy, so they seemed to
be in a different starting location from me.

I could see Kaya, however, judging by her jade eyes, she hadn’t taken on
her dark personality. Oh, there was also Lisetta. Now that I looked
closely, there were actually many people that I recognized.

“The joint practical evaluation will be taken by first and second-years
at the same time. The test is simple. Clear each gate and reach the
destination to pass. Also, 30 minutes after the start of the test, it is
possible to gather teammates. When the bracelets simultaneously touch
each other, you will be recognized as teammates. For reference, each
party can be composed of up to four people, but there are no limits to
the number of Class D students that can be within a group.”

The joint practical evaluation was designed to be difficult to clear as
a solo unless one was at the level of Dark Kaya or Luce. Most students
would need to form a party if they intended to pass the exam.

The reason why Class D students weren’t included in the member
restriction was that no one would accept them if they were a part of the
limit. However, if a Class D student was merely an extra, there was no
reason to refuse them.

“There are other restrictions as well. If you summon a magical beast or
familiar when you are not clearing a gate, you will be disqualified.
Keep that in mind.”

Familiars or magical beasts were convenient means of transportation.
Thus, using them took away from the essence of the race, which was meant
to be a joint practical evaluation.

“Additionally, there are fake demonic creatures made of puppet magic.
Unlike demonic illusions, these are capable of actually harming you.
There is no need to worry as there are outstanding healers on standby.
However, keep in mind that you will be eliminated if you suffer a fatal
injury or it is impossible for you to continue the test. That is all.”

Professor Fernando raised his right arm up and formed a bullet of
elemental mana on his index finger.

“Ready, set.”

Utter silence. All the students got in a ready position as they prepared
to run. The tension in the air was heavy.

I slung Zhonya’s Staff over my shoulder and got into a comfortable
position to run.

*Tang–!*

Professor Fernando shot the bullet and as it flew into the sky, it
exploded with elemental magic.

*Boom—!*

“Start.”

Ice crystals embroidered the sky.

The sound of fireworks boomed as Professor Fernando’s voice fell on us.

*Zooooom–!* The students started to furiously run.

“LET’S GOOOO!”

“Move!”

“Dude, are you cheating already?!”

“Here we go!”

‘What a mess.’

It was an expected scene. If PVP had been enabled, the chaos would’ve
been historical.

The sub-scenario 「Joint Practical Evaluation」.

The difference between the main scenario and a sub-scenario was that no
matter what kind of result occurred, it wouldn’t confirm a bad ending.
There was no real need to play this for game progression, however, as
someone whose reality was the game itself, there was no skip button for
me.

Besides, I needed to complete this sub-scenario anyway. It was to
prevent the Extra Bad Ending No.8 「Frog」.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the ‘Frog Demon’ appeared during the
second semester of the first year. It was a demon based on the fairy
tale 「The Frog Prince」.

It was a demon so weak that it couldn’t even be compared to the demons
that have appeared so far.

‘It’s just a bit of a hassle to eliminate though.’

In a hard-to-find location within the vast academy grounds, the Frog
Demon would suddenly appear. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, each new
playthrough would have a different location. Thus, it was very
inefficient to go around looking for him.

The only certainty was that during the joint practical evaluation, the
frog demon would appear after clearing the fourth gate in Machea Ravine.

Unlike the demons so far who had appeared five minutes before all hell
broke loose, the frog demon was harmless for now.

***However, if I don’t eliminate the frog demon before the end of the
semester, the conditions of some bullshit magic would trigger, allowing
that bastard to turn a person into a frog in exchange for their body.***

So what would happen then? That bastard would take Ian Fairytale’s body
and turn him into a frog.

As a result, the frog demon would have a grand time in school wearing
Ian’s body.

Ian would continue to be a mere frog until the credits roll for the
Extra Bad Ending N.8 「Frog」.

“Ha!”

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Hoooooo—.*

The energetic laugh of Tristan Humphrey, a vain blonde nobleman, rang
out among the students. It was bordered on a shout.

I turned my gaze towards Tristan. The guy was wrapped in wind mana as he
levitated above the other students.

“I will be the first to go!!”

Kuhahaha!! He laughed as he quickly flew ahead of everyone, but suddenly
started to cough as if he choked on something.

With his example, all students with the wind element wrapped themselves
with wind mana and started to fly in the air as well.

‘That isn’t a good idea.’

Due to the immense mana consumption, it wouldn’t take long for them to
run out.

*Whoong—!*

“What the?! Uaak!”

Suddenly, a female student with light green pigtails flew with great
speed and flew past Tristan. It was a speed comparable to a jet. The
gust of wind that followed in her wake pushed Tristan aside.

The Magic Department freshman second seat, Kaya Astrea. A preliminary
boost of wind would only be worth it if one was at her level.

Everyone here knew that using wind magic to fly was not an efficient use
of mana. In the end, however, people would follow by example.

The students became anxious as they rushed to start.

\* \* \*

‘How are you here…?’

After the joint practical evaluation started, Eve Rophenheim ran among
the students as well. She thought to herself while gazing at Isaac from
behind.

***He’s someone with no skill, talent, or ability. It’s impossible for
him to be in a place like this!***

However, it was unmistakable. When she saw his face earlier, it really
was Isaac.

‘Something about him… changed.’

He was taller than before and his physique had also become more defined.
In the past, he was only a small and cute boy, but now, he exuded a
manly charm.

And the staff in his hands. It was clearly difficult to wield so the
fact that he was holding it meant that…

***He can use that staff? That Isaac?***

Eve squeezed the staff in her hands. Her mind was scrambled with
disbelief.

<span id="0092_93_-_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 93: - Joint Practical Evaluation (2)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (2) ༻**

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」 「Wind Wall (Wind Element, ★4)」
「Flame Wall (Fire Element, ★4)」 「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Dudeuuk────!!*

*Hooooo────!!*

*Hwareuuk────!!*

“What?!”

“This crazy bastard!”

“Isn’t this cheating&gt;!”

“Yeah, no\~.”

PvP wasn’t allowed in the joint practical evaluation. As such, in the
beginning, students chose to impede the progress of others by using
non-combat elemental spells.

Although the students used a variety of spells to break the elemental
walls, every time they did so, a new wall formed in front of them.

‘That’s enough.’

I stopped in my tracks and placed one of my hands on the ground.

Light brown mana flowed out of my palm.

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」

*Dureureuk────!*

A stone pillar erupted out of the ground with terrifying speed, pushing
my body upwards.

The stone pillar drew an arc over all the other elemental walls on the
surface as I anchored my hands and feet onto the stone pillar.

There was a limit to how far I could extend the pillar so I formed a new
one to jump on and repeated this action while being carried through the
air.

After passing by all the bothersome elemental walls, I easily landed
back on the ground with a loud thud.

“What was that?”

“Is he really a part of the Magic Department? What kind of physical
ability is that…?”

Rather than my magic, the students were amazed at my athleticism.

*Dudeuuk────*!

Students with solid elements like rock and ice began to follow my lead.
However.

“Ahhh! Get me down from here!”

“Scary!!”

There were a number of people who couldn’t execute it properly. It was
because they tried to imitate me without having the proper skills to do
so. Not to mention, they couldn’t even control their own fear.

Without precise mana control and athletic ability, they could never copy
the method I just showed. They were practically digging their own graves
at this point.

‘What are they doing.’

***It was a pitiful sight to see.***

Shortly thereafter, the first intersection appeared.

After running through the water-filled canyon, I reached a fork in the
road. It was clearly distinguishable thanks to the milestones that were
placed.

It was a question of whether one continues to go through the canyon and
enter a cave or go up the stairs to the top of the canyon.

Here, students were also separated into two categories: students who
choose a path without hesitation and students who become indecisive.
Obviously, I was of the former.

‘It was this way.’

My choice was towards the stairs. I could only find the frog demon if I
went this way.

If one looked up from below, there was a terrifying bridge on the path
up the canyon, so few students chose this treacherous path.

‘It’s a relief that I don’t have a fear of heights.’

It didn’t mean much for me to cross a creaky bridge high up in the air.
At most, it was a thrilling ride to enjoy.

A few brave souls also chose the stairs. I blended into their ranks as I
began to run up the stairs.

***The frog demon will leave its place after 4 p.m. I need to reach it
before that. I don’t have much time left.***

*Dudududu──!!*

After going up a couple of stairs, I made a stone platform on the cliff
and proceeded to jump onto it.

After I landed, the rock began to stretch upwards and pushed me over the
precipice.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, even if you were only a little late, you
would witness a cursed scene where some aggro bastard shattered your
leg. If that happened, you would have no choice but to choose a
different path.

As I ran on top of the canyon, I saw a large bridge connecting to
another canyon. The view was absolutely stunning, just as I had expected
it to be.

Without hesitation, I started to cross the bridge.

*Creak, creak–!*

‘Ahhk!’

Unexpectedly, I found myself on an amusement park ride.

Because of the strong winds hitting the bridge like a tidal wave; it was
constantly rocking back and forth.

I thought it would only shake a bit… What was I expected to do if it was
also oscillating up and down?

The natural wind mana in the surroundings must have flowed very
aggressively for such a phenomenon to occur.

I grabbed the railing and adjusted my balance. If I was careless, my
body would fly away.

“Ahhhk!”

“What the hell is this!”

“Someone save me!!”

I could hear the cries of despair from the students that followed behind
me.

***If they were gonna be like this, why did they even come here…***

“Oh!”

It was hard to continue. I couldn’t take it anymore. Although it may
help the bastards behind me, it was more important for me to get off
this bridge ASAP.

I stretched my arm and spilled ice mana downwards. I casted a buffed
\[Ice Generation\] thanks to Zhonya’s Staff.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

*Chararak──*.

The ice spread thinly and widely. As a result, the bridge froze into a
magnificent ice sculpture.

Done. Finally, my legs wouldn’t squirm like an eel any longer.

“This guy!”

“Oop! That’s slippery!”

“But it’s shaking less! Thank you, my friend!”

Since there was a gentleman who expressed his gratitude, I lifted my arm
to the side and gave him a thumbs-up.

‘\[Rock Generation\].’

I had only my heels touch the bridge as I used \[Rock Generation\] to
make sharp spikes on the soles of my shoes. It was to reduce the area of
contact while also allowing me to slide easily across.

As I extended my right arm backward, I condensed ice mana and ignited it
to produce immense force and an icy fire.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Kwaaaa────!!*

It was a booster.

“Oh!!”

Using \[Frostfire\] as the driving force, I exploded forward and quickly
traversed the ice bridge.

It was a refreshing speed. My silver-blue hair flapped wildly in the
wind. A startled sound escaped from me unintentionally.

It was an application of \[Frostfire\] that required a tremendous amount
of mana control and skill.

Although I couldn’t fly like Iron Man yet, at the very least, it was a
possibility to use \[Frostfire\] as a booster.

However, because I needed to condense mana and let out immense pressure,
the required mana was too high and the efficiency had much to be
desired. I wouldn’t be able to overuse it until I became skillful enough
in handling it.

In an instant, my body slid across the bridge and reached the canyon on
the other side.

I removed the stone spikes on my shoes and defrosted the ice from the
bridge. My elemental mana shone brightly as it scattered like powder
before disappearing.

The bridge started to chaotically shake again. The students let out
screams of terror.

“No?! What kind of bastard would give help and then take it away?!”

“Ahhk! Does anyone have the ice element?! Hurry and try to freeze it
again!”

“Ugh! It’s difficult! How is it possible to have that much mana control
in this condition?!”

Did someone say something? Must just be me.

I secured Zhonya’s Staff onto my back with a belt that was wrapped
diagonally around my upper body as I continued to run.

*Beep, Beep–.*

While crossing through the canyon, a maple forest appeared. The
surroundings were filled with bright red maple leaves.

At the same time, the bracelet on my left wrist lit up and sounded an
alarm.

I reached the first gate.

Pellets of mana flowed out of the bracelet to form letters in the air.

‘First gate, find the Bead of Nebirus’.

The Bead of Nebirus was a magic orb that emitted small traces of mana.
While the name implied a spherical nature, in reality, the shape was a
cube. It was slightly smaller than the size of a ping-pong ball.

Additionally, if one knew the form, one could find the source of the
mana even faster. It was an official setting in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, but I didn’t know the principle behind it.

***Of course, I had no need for such specific and tedious
information.***

“Easy clear.”

Since I already knew the location, the need for delicate mana perception
and a detailed understanding of the shape were meaningless.

*Ring─♪*

After finding the Bead of Nebirus in the ground near a certain tree, the
bracelet let out a green light with a satisfying chime.

Mana pellets appeared and formed letters again. Under the words ‘Gate
Clear’, there was an arrow that pointed me to the direction of the next
path.

I set off in that direction.

‘Oh, by the way.’

***This person won’t stop stalking me…***

I could feel wind mana coiling from a distance, so it didn’t take me
long to realize that… someone was definitely following me.

I took out a small hand mirror from the spatial magic in my uniform’s
inner pocket and started to repeatedly sneak glances behind me with
squinted eyes.

Silver-blue hair tied to the side. Catlike features with sharp eyes. The
wooden staff embraced in her arms.

─‘If you’re ready, then go. I can’t bear to see you.’

The subdued voice of the woman I met during the Trial of Frost passed
through my mind. It was Isaac’s older sister.

I already knew she was a student of Märchen Academy.

‘I remember now.’

I put the small hand mirror back into my pocket space.

A female student NPC in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ who was thought to be
related to Isaac. When I saw her silver-blue hair chasing me, I
remembered her clearly.

It was painfully obvious that she had Ripley Syndrome^1^TL Note: Ripley
syndrome is the term for antisocial personality disorder that denies
one’s reality and believes that the fictional world they imagine is
real. A Ripley syndrome patient repeats false words and actions.; no one
stayed by her side and she wandered around like a loner… She seemed like
an NPC with a tragic backstory.

The female student chasing after me was that very girl: Isaac’s mentally
ill older sister.

I didn’t have all of Isaac’s memories. Only a part of his story remained
in my head.

That was why I didn’t know who that person was and what business she had
with me, nor did I care.

‘Just don’t get in my way.’

At the moment, my primary goal was to take care of the frog demon. As
such, the only thing I could hope for was for her to stay out of my way.

I continued to run towards the next gate.

\* \* \*

Eve Rophenheim’s eyes were filled with shock.

‘H-how did he do that…?’

Eve herself could not currently detect the mana from the Bead of
Nebirus… However, Isacc found it in an instant.

***How extraordinary was his mana perception?***

In addition, after the joint practical evaluation began, Isaac, who
nonchalantly threw around ice and rock elemental spells, was an
impossible sight to see. How did that guy, who didn’t even have an ounce
of mana, become like this…?

Even his skill level was high. Although the staff certainly helped
improve his abilities, the fact of the matter was that having the
ability to wield such a weapon was a testament to his skill.

‘Since when… did he improve that much?’

The last time she saw Isaac was just over two years ago. It was the day
their mother passed away. Even when she saw him then, Isaac was someone
so useless that he didn’t even require a second glance.

It was simply inconceivable to improve this much in just two years. The
rate of growth was simply way too fast.

Eve assumed that Isaac was hiding something that even she did not know
about. She wanted to identify what it was.

“Oops.”

Isaac was already far ahead of Eve. If she was any slower, she’d
completely lose him.

Unable to keep her mouth shut, Eve chewed her lips as she continued to
chase after Isaac.

Chapter 94: - Joint Practical Evaluation (3)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (3) ༻**

The second gate was also cleared smoothly.

It was a test where you first examine the mana circuit engraved on a
huge magic pillar. You needed to find a place on the circuit where mana
flowed the most smoothly. To pass the test, you would pour magic into
the specific area you found and the pillar would start to shine in a
blinding light.

As stated before, I was one of the OGs to play ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱. I didn’t even need to scrutinize the mana circuit since all I
needed to do was look at the pattern on the pillars to easily pass the
test.

The third gate was a battle with demonic creatures. Eliminating any 10
demonic creatures was enough to pass the gate.

I was still inside the forest.

Now was the time to recruit some allies. No matter what, they had to be
good at combat.

To get to the frog demon, I needed to pass the fourth gate. And to pass
the fourth gate, I needed to win in combat against a gatekeeper that
would positioned there.

Most students would be eliminated at the fourth gate. Even I couldn’t
defeat the gatekeeper alone.

‘If things went as planned, I should get there pretty easily.’

If Plan A worked, there was no need for any allies.

However, because of an unexpected variable, I needed to turn to Plan B
which required actual teammates.

Oh, by the way, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the main characters were
different for every playthrough, so I had no idea who I would end up
meeting on my way to the fourth gate.

「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Roar───!! Kwang! Kwang!!*

\[Gueghh!!\]

“Stop whining so much.”

Right on time, a noisy rock spell paired with a husky voice could be
heard. I had a feeling that she would choose the same path as me.

With orange hair tied into a ponytail, a female student with gold eyes
appeared. It was Lisetta Lionheart. Before the Joint Practical
Evaluation started, she was on the same starting line as me.

For once, she had all her uniform shirt buttons fastened, but her jacket
was tied around her waist. Now that I think about it, I have never seen
her wear her uniform normally.

Lisetta looked down at the Fang Hippo that she was pummeling with rock
magic, slinging her Rock Bat over her shoulder.

‘Target spotted.’

***Looks like I found my first prey.***

I was teammates with Lisetta during the hunting evaluation as well. The
connection I formed back then looked like it was going to pay off now.

\[Gueghh!!\]

At that moment, a ferocious purple hippo with long fangs began to charge
towards me.

***This bastard must have also seen me as prey.***

It was the demonic creature, Fang Hippo. Despite it standing on four
legs, it was still taller than me.

“…?”

After hearing the Fang Hippo’s roar, Lisetta turned her face towards me.

Her two eyes opened widely, almost bulging out of her face.

“You asshole, why are you here…?”

Before saying hello, I should probably get rid of the Fang Hippo first.

I raised Zhonya’s Staff and pointed its head in the direction of the
Fang Hippo.

Next, I poured ice mana into it.

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Stab──!*

\[Guegh…\]

A spear of ice materialized above my head and cut through the air,
completely penetrating the Fang Hippo like a kebab.

One blow was enough to destroy the bastard.

During the hunting evaluation, I had to be cautious around such a
monster… However, I could now kill it with ease.

‘Less go.’

The Fang Hippo pierced by \[Ice Spear\] convulsed a bit before
transforming into a rough outline of a puppet.

*Beep–.*

The bracelet had the number ‘1’ written on it. In the third gate, the
number would increase by 1 for every demonic creature I eliminated, and
once that number reached 10 I would clear the gate.

Only then did I turn to look at Lisetta. She twitched as her shoulders
trembled.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Nervous because of her fear of
you.\]

A relationship based on fear was not suitable for being teammates. Even
if it was a one-time thing.

If so, I should probably try my best to reassure her right?

“Long time no see. Have you been well?”

I pretended to wear a gentlemanly smile.

I approached Lisetta and greeted her in a friendly manner.

“W-why are you acting all friendly?! It’s giving me goosebumps…!”

Lisetta broke out in a cold sweat as she nervously backed away. During
the hunting evaluation, she treated me like her lackey, a far cry from
what was shown now.

I tried my best to appear gentle so I was kind of sad that she reacted
like this.

Whatever. Let’s go back to the topic at hand.

“You. Join my crew.”

“Stop spouting bullshit.”

It was supposed to be a universal rule to become allies if I hit her
with that pickup line though… Lisetta had no hesitation in shutting it
down instantly.

Well, I should have expected it.

“Lisetta.”

I stuck close to Lisetta and slung an arm over her shoulder. It was a
move to express my friendliness.

Lisetta’s face slightly trembled for a moment. She tried to act tough,
but she couldn’t even control the slight tremors in her body. Her golden
eyes were filled with subtle fear.

Judging by her inability to fling my arm away, it looked like she had no
courage to resist me in the first place.

I didn’t know she was this scared of me… I should hurry and relieve her
anxiety.

“This is just my thoughts, but I think the fourth gate will be pretty
hard to clear. Let’s help each other. If I’m one of the members of your
party, isn’t it also beneficial for you? We even exchanged secrets
together, remember?”

“Um, uh, how do you know that the fourth gate was difficult? Did you
find out with that Archwizard-level mana perception bullshit of yours?
This asshole…”

“Are you going to join me or not?”

I cut off her bullshit straight away.

“…Why do you need to go this far? Didn’t you want to take it easy for
the exams?”

“There’s something important I need to do.”

I decided to stop talking secretively. I whispered in a serious voice.

Lisetta’s eyes squinted. Her gold eyes met mine.

“Is a dangerous bastard popping out this time as well?”

“Not as dangerous as last time.”

“Ha, fuck… Not again.”

Lisetta grabbed her head as she let out a deep sigh.

Shortly thereafter, she continued in a sharp voice.

“…I don’t like you.”

“Oh really? I like you because you’re like a friend to me though.”

“What?”

“Thanks for helping me out during the social gathering.”

I was being sincere. She was annoying when I fought Elphelt the
Evanescent at Elt Island, but I was touched when she supported me during
the social gathering.

I mean, wasn’t it normal to become friends by stacking up both positive
and negative affection? That Rose bitch was an exception, of course.

“It wasn’t for you so don’t misunderstand since it makes me feel like
shit if you do.”

Lisetta grumbled with annoyance as she lifted the bracelet on her left
wrist.

“…Fine, only until the fourth gate.”

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Doesn’t want anything dangerous
to happen to the students.\]

I saw it often in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Although she seemed belligerent and rude, she secretly cared about and
tried to protect others. She was the sterotypical bully tsundere. That
was who Lisetta was.

“I’m counting on you.”

I smirked as I placed my bracelet over hers.

*Ding─♪*

A tiny blue light started to glow on our bracelets. It signified that we
were now in the same party.

‘Yes!’

I obtained a dependable force!

“Hah! Let us go, Lisetta!”

“Ahk! Don’t pat my head, it’s gross!”

I happily stroked the hair on her head, however, Lisetta quickly put
distance between us, acting as if she was startled by some pest.

***What kind of treatment is this?***

***Whatever, I don’t care anyway. It was enough for me to recruit a
reliable ally.***

*Crash───!*

*Crack──!*

Lisetta and I easily destroyed the demonic creatures and, after filling
the quota, we passed the third gate.

Once again, mana pellets flowed out of the bracelet to form many
different directional markers, each of which led to the next gate.
Additionally, some of these were further marked with deep red mana
pellets in a ‘triangle’ shape. This meant that another student had
already reached this location.

I started to walk towards one of these triangle markers.

“Hello, did you forget what that shape stood for?”

“It’s fine so just follow me.”

I already manipulated the situation so that no other student would
choose this path.

As I left the forest, bright sunlight poured down on me. I shaded my
eyes with my hands. Far beyond, a palm-sized blue sky could be seen.

We were still on top of the canyon. I turned my head to the side and saw
a cliff.

There were steep limestone cliffs right in front of us, the stairs to
the top were jagged. If we reached the top, we would be able to proceed
with the fourth gate.

“I shouldn’t have chosen this path…”

Lisetta’s inner monologue held deep regret.

I mean, how bad could the stairs be? Even if it was a little high, the
cliff was in such an open space. I could probably climb up the stairs
with my eyes closed.

I turned my back towards Lisetta and kneeled down with one leg.

“Get on.”

“Are you fucking crazy? You’re better off telling me to hop up the cliff
like a rabbit.”

“Hooo, I knew you would be like this.”

“…Eh? W-what are you trying to do? W-wait! Ahhh!”

It was enough to express my considerate nature just once. We were on a
time limit after all.

I approached Lisetta, and forcefully lifted her into a princess-carry.

Although Lisetta, in her own way, had a pretty good physique from
exercising, there was no comparison to me whose pure strength was so
overwhelming that I could manhandle her with ease.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Currently very flustered because
of you.\]

“You! Wh-wh-what is the meaning of this…?!”

“Don’t move.”

I responded in a firm voice and sent rock mana beneath my feet.

「Rock Generation (Rock Element, ★1)」

*Dudeuuk────!!*

“AHHHHH!”

In an instant, a rock pillar erupted beneath my feet, our bodies rose
upward as the pillar grew in size.

Just like before, whenever a stone pillar reached its limits, I made a
new one from the cliff.

After switching to the new pillar, I continued to shoot up, repeating
these actions continuously.

It was a method that required execptional mana mastery, a sense of
balance, and athletic ability. It was full of risk and danger, but it
wasn’t that big of a deal for me.

“Ar-ar, are you crazy?!”

“This is so much faster, right?”

“Ugh, this bastardr…!”

With that, Lisetta didn’t say anything else and only sighed deeply.

*Dudeuuk────!!*

After a while, the pillar that we rode finally reached the top of the
cliff, allowing me to lightly jump off and land safely.

Right in the middle of the flat ground surrounded by maple trees, there
was a small entrance to an underground cave.

“Lisetta, are you okay?”

“Sigh…”

Lisetta sagged with deep lamentation. Looks like she lost her soul on
the way up.

“Sir Isaac!”

As if she was waiting, a girl in green pigtails was leaning against the
maple tree. She started running towards me as she squealed in delight.

It was the freshmen second seat of the Magic Department, Kaya Astrea.

Her eyes were a jade hue. It was her original self.

“Second seat?”

Lisetta was flustered when Kaya popped out of nowhere.

“I was waiting for y-!”

Suddenly, Kaya froze. It was as if time had stopped for her alone.

Immediately, a complicated emotion flooded into her trembling pupils.

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Psychology:** \[Currently filled with envy and
jealousy towards Lisetta Lionheart who is being princess-carried in your
arms.\]

For now…

***This isn’t a very good situation.***

<span id="0094_96_-_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 96: - Joint Practical Evaluation (5)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (5) ༻**

A bigot against commoners.

He was already well aware that he was called such names.

However, Phillip Meltron would never back down from his belief that
one’s worth was determined by their background.

After all, a commoner was inferior in every aspect, including their
attitude and intelligence. Meanwhile, nobles were thoroughly educated
and exuded an air of elegance befitting of their prestigious position.

During his academy days, he was ostracized, ridiculed, and cursed by
these commoners.

Even when he worked as an assistant professor, they were thieves who
stole anything that they could get their grubby little hands on.

They were even degenerates who abused their own loved ones. All of these
examples were done by dirty commoners.

He firmly believed that this country had a caste system for a suitable
reason. As the commoners were a far cry from the dignified and honorable
nobles.

Even if there was a small chance of an exception, this universal rule
remained set in stone.

This was the truth that Phillip knew.

「Fire Generation (Fire Element, ★1)」

*Kwaaaah——!*

Professor Phillip let loose furious flames in every direction.

The flames spread across the ground, dominating the entirety of the
cave.

However.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Hooooooo——!*

Kaya’s wind gathered with greater intensity as it slowly pushed away
Professor Philip’s flames.

Seeing this, Professor Phillip raised the wand in his hand and conjured
a bright red magic circle.

The flames battled against Kaya’s wind, raging and flowing across the
arena. Wave after wave of red relentlessly charged against green.

「Sea of Fire (Fire Element, ★4)」

*Kwaaaah——!*

Kaya’s wind quickly got pushed away. However, she had no intention of
backing down. She dragged out an enormous amount of mana to fight back.

「Zephyr (Wind Element, ★4)」

*Hooooooo——!*

The fierce gust of wind clashed against an ocean of flames as they
continued to fight for supremacy. Kaya and Phillip’s hair scattered
violently in the resulting pressure.

They pointed their respective wands at each other as they let loose
their spells. The flames were spread widely, blocking their vision.

“As expected of the second seat, your ability is worthy of admiration.
However, if this is all you can muster, I will be quite disappointed.”

He could feel it. The second seat, Kaya Astrea, was pouring out her
entire mana reserves to resist.

It was wind magic so powerful that it was hard to believe it was from a
freshman. One day, she would surely surpass Phillip himself.

However, no matter how strong she was, she was currently only a first
year student.

Phillip let his mana flow with greater intensity.

Kaya squinted her eyes. The hand that held her wand shook as she tried
to resist. Unfortunately, her wind was voraciously eaten by Phillip’s
flames.

At that moment.

“…?”

Isaac and his 2m tall golem familiar, Eden, stood on Kaya’s right.

Lisetta stood on Kaya’s left with her rock armor lion familiar Jeff,
whose mane rippled in the wind.

Philip’s eyes shook greatly. They must have been trying to distract him
with this display.

“Lisetta!”

In conjunction with Isaac’s shout, a light brown magic circle lit up
Lisetta’s surroundings.

「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Kuooooo———!!*

Boulders exploded from the ground like a beanstalk, extending towards
Phillip from both sides. It was a size and speed that could easily crush
a person.

It was an admirable attempt. The sight of it made Phillip scoff in
exasperation.

“That is not enough. Block it, Stego.”

Mana gathered around Phillip as a white outline the size of him
converged into the form of a golem.

Stego, the 5-star rock element familiar. His body made of rocks was
similar to a human, with two green eyes glowing on his face.

\[Dureuk!!\]

Stego let out a scratchy cry and extended both his arms, erupting a
giant mass of rock from the ground.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Crash———!*

Isaac and Lisetta crashed into the obstacle made by Stego.

Lisetta’s \[Rock Avalanche\] broke through Stego’s \[Rock Wall\].
However, at the same time, her rocks turned into chunks as they flew in
the air.

The scattered pieces of rock were easily burned away in a whirlwind of
fire.

「Fire Ball (Fire Element, ★3)」

*Hwareuk! Crash! Crash! Crash!*

Phillip counterattacked. His \[Fireballs\] were 3m in diameter as they
fell on Isaac and Lisetta like ballistic missiles.

Isaac blocked them with a rock barrier formed by Eden, while Lisetta
dodged the bombardment on her lion familiar, Jeff.

Phillip casually floated in the sky, not having moved an inch. After
all, he effortlessly blocked the combined attacks of Isaac, Kaya, and
Lisetta.

*Hoooo!!!*

“Hm?”

Kaya’s wind grew in intensity. The squirrel familiar on her shoulder
combined its wind magic with hers. She was clearly not to be
underestimated.

To match Kaya’s wind, Philip raised the intensity of his flames as well.

“Ugh!”

His attacks were heavy with power. Kaya gritted her teeth. She wouldn’t
be able to last long in this tug-of-war with Phillip’s flames.

The suffocating heat in the cave gradually spread.

The bright green wind that was wrapped around the flames wavered.

It was hard to see due to the maelstrom of various spells. The fierce
flames slowly cornered Isaac’s party.

*Crack—! Boom—!*

Even the messenger hiding in the corner was assaulted by flames. The
round magic tool fell to the ground as it crumpled into ashes.

Phillip blinked his eyes calmly.

It would be difficult to break through such a large storm of flames.

Phillip lightly waved his wand like a conductor as he spread the flames
even further. He aimed at Isaac and Lisetta who were looking for a
chance to counterattack.

“…What in the world?”

However, the mana of the weakest person here was felt in a different
place.

On top.

Phillip raised his head while squinting his eyes.

Beyond the fierce tempest of flames, a boy looked down on Phillip with
his feet placed firmly in ice. He hung from the ceiling like a bat.

Concentrated ice mana formed in his right hand as a complex pale blue
magic circle formed in front of him.

How did he get up there? It wasn’t hard to think of the answer. The
golem familiar, Eden, probably flung him up with pure strength.

The staff that he held since earlier was given to Eden as if it was too
bothersome to carry.

From examining the magic, there was no doubt that Isaac was planning to
use the 5-star spell \[Frost Explosion\].

The ice that held Isaac to the ceiling was defrosted and Isaac succumbed
to gravity as he rapidly fell towards Phillip.

‘Is he trying to pierce through these flames?’

The flames were still roaring in every direction. Unless he was planning
on becoming a charred corpse, there was no way he would foolishly decide
to brave the fire.

Therefore, it was impossible to harm Phillip

Contrary to Phillip’s thoughts, Isaac’s target was, in fact, not
Phillip.

“…!”

Isaac reached his arms out towards the firestorm.

The collection of ice mana in his right hand emitted a brilliant pale
blue glow as it exploded forth in every direction.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Kuaaaaaaah———!*

An immense explosion of ice created gigantic masses of ice that crashed
into the heat of the flames, pushing it back briefly.

An enormous amount of water vapor was released into the air.

“Ugh!”

The explosion of vapor flung Isaac backward as Eden jumped up to catch
him.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, Kaya’s wind disappeared like a phantom.

Phillip’s flames fell upon Kaya, however, Kaya lifted her body with wind
mana and quickly flew away into a corner.

The tip of her light green hair was slightly singed as she got away. It
was an inevitable sacrifice.

「Cold Divergence (Ice Element, ★2)」

*Crackle———!*

Isaac used that opening to take back Zhonya’s Staff from Eden and
proceeded to spread out a fog of cold air with \[Cold Divergence\].

\[Cold Divergence\]. It was a commonly used spell by ice element wizards
to block vision.

Phillip could not see anything because of the thick fog above his head.

*Crash——!*

The giant ice masses that were not melted by the flames crashed onto the
ground as they broke into smithereens.

‘Something’s off…’

Alarm bells were ringing in Phillip’s mind as the flow of battle was
suspicious.

It felt like Isaac was purposefully blocking his vision. Additionally,
Kaya seemed to time her escape simultaneously.

‘Were they already preparing their next atta-’

He was given no time to think.

*——Kuooooooo!!*

As his flames pushed away the cold air, Phillip saw a gigantic object
filling his vision.

A huge chunk of ice pierced through the air with a threatening loud
noise.

Kaya had used her wind mana to collect the white cold air.

Through this, she wrapped the cold air around the huge chunk of ice and
shot it in the direction of Phillip.

In the corner of the cave, Isaac was sending waves of ice mana with
Zhonya’s staff. He must have used the vapor to synergize the elements
together, thus creating this huge chunk of ice.

If the aim of the vapor was to make this, it was worthy of praise…

***…For a commoner, that is.***

The reason why cold air was used to wrap around the chunk of ice was to
ensure that it did not melt.

Of course, Kaya was the one who was truly exceptional.

To control a mass of ice of that size would require an immense amount of
mana, as well as exceptional mana control. It was a talent worthy of the
second seat.

After focusing back on the fight, he realized that the only mana he
could perceive was from Kaya and Isaac. Even now, he could not feel
Lisetta using any spell. It meant that she was looking for an opening.

Thus, that comet of ice was a combination of purely Isaac’s ice and
Kaya’s wind.

Phillip laughed leisurely as he poured out even more mana.

He had the fire element. As such, this kind of attack was merely a waste
of mana.

They weren’t gonna win against him anyway. He was certain of it.

He was going to play along for a while until the time was ripe to subdue
them. Then, he would torture the commoner bastard a bit before…

***…He eliminated all of them.***

*Kuahhhhhh———!*

It was right in front of him now.

At the most opportune moment, when it was almost impossible for him to
dodge. It was truly a blink in the fabric of time.

During this moment, he didn’t question the situation too hard. As such,
he made a decision based solely on instinct. It was based on the logic
that fire would always melt ice.

That logic paired with Phillip’s insane competitiveness decided his next
actions.

Phillip waved his wand towards the white ice wrapped in cold air. His
wand glowed with light red mana.

「Napalm Bomb (Fire Element, ★4)」

*Crash!!*

Massive flames exploded out of the magic circle as the resulting
shockwave shattered parts of the ice chunk.

「Firestorm (Fire Element, ★4)」

*Hwarereuk——!*

At the same time, a storm of fire erupted.

The flames surged with greater strength, swallowing the entire chunk of
ice while releasing massive waves of heat.

A second tug-of-war started against Kaya’s wind. While pushing away the
comet, the flames quickly melted the ice.

‘I shall lightly cook all of you.’

Suddenly, Phillip saw Isaac let out a small smirk as if he was waiting
for just this moment. That’s when Phillip realized.

“···!!”

The ice melting off the meteor made it more compact. As such, Kaya was
able to use this new size more aerodynamically.

As a result, it expertly penetrated \[Firestorm\], scattering the flames
as it continued to shoot toward Phillip.

The speed and size of it were not decreasing at all.

Only at that moment was Phillip able to see what was hidden inside the
ice.

It was a golden boulder.

“Ste…!”

***It was already too late.***

1-star Ice Element Spell, \[Ice Generation\].

2-star Ice Element Spell, \[Cold Divergence\].

4-star Wind Element Spell, \[Zephyr\].

And finally, 3-star Rock Element Spell, \[Falling Boulder\]

The comet made of various spells did not give Phillip a single chance to
escape before collapsing on top of him.

「Frostfall Comet of the End (Rock + Ice + Wind Element)」

*Boom———!!*

The collision of fire and ice let out even more vapor.

Additionally, the collision of the boulder with the ground let out an
immense boom as dust and flames scattered everywhere.

The huge chunk of ice paired with the skillful control of \[Zephyr\]
produced this triple joint spell, \[Frostfall Comet of the End\].

And within it, Lisetta’s hidden boulder made of highly dense mana
completed the spell.

Isaac, Kaya, and Lisetta covered their faces with their arms due to the
resulting explosion.

The wide cave was filled with white smoke until it gradually faded away.

\[Frostfall Comet of the End\] disintegrated into powder as a rainbow of
colors started to float in the air.

\[Dureuk. Dudureuk…\]

In the thick silence, Stego’s dull cries echoed. His green eyes faded
and his body came to a stop. It seemed as if he had fainted.

Next to him, Phillip laid on the ground bleeding.

Thanks to his \[Basic Protection Magic\] he always had activated, the
resulting shockwave must have lessened. However, the state of his body
was nothing short of a wreck. It was understandable as he was hit with
Lisetta’s boulder that was accelerated by Kaya’s wind.

“Kuheuk…”

Phillip groaned out in pain.

He only understood what happened after it was all over.

\[Frostfall Comet of the End\].

While Kaya and Phillip were focused on their tug-of-war, Lisetta must
have used \[Falling Boulder\] to create a boulder infused with a highly
dense rock mana. Kaya probably used her wind to support it in the air.

Isaac and Lisetta’s rock element spells were probably distractions that
made it hard for him to detect the mana that was used.

Isaac must have used the exploding vapor as a smokescreen to quickly
freeze the boulder. During that moment, \[Elemental Synergy\] occurred
to make the ice thicker than normal.

Finally, Kaya’s wind gave this huge comet the momentum it needed.

The \[Cold Divergence\] used in \[Frostfall Comet of the End\] also had
a clear goal. The white fog resulting from the cold air hid what was
actually within the ice, making it difficult to react until the
inevitable moment of defeat.

‘Were they planning this… From the very beginning…?”

Phillip chewed on his lips. His trembling hands grabbed the ground for
support. He could have never imagined that he would be in such a
miserable state instantaneously.

It was as if he was dancing on someone’s palms from the very beginning.

*Step—.*

He heard footsteps right in front of him as a shadow loomed over.

Phillip raised his head and looked at the student.

That silver-blue-haired commoner, Isaac, was looking down on him.

He was definitely laughing. It was as if he knew it would be like this
since before the fight even started…

‘Do you mean to say that this was all according to your plan…?’

His anger surged.

***How dare a student, much less a commoner, play him like a fiddle and
look down on him?***

Phillip was so furious, he couldn’t stand it.

From the depths of his mind, intense denial rose like lava.

“Professor.”

Isaac kneeled down and looked at Phillip. His expression was one of
assured confidence. Confidence that the situation would play out his
way.

Truthfully, Isaac had a lot of different strategies and tricks to take
down Phillip. His expression only reflected his happiness in defeating
Phillip on his first attempt.

It was only for that reason that he smiled. Honestly, Isaac didn’t have
the time to be satisfied with just this trivial matter.

‘Why do I… need to look up… to this commoner bastard?’

As shame and anger swirled within Phillip, Isaac started talking.

“We won.”

“…You’re just a commoner! How dare you say such blasphemy…!”

The commoner bastard dared look down on him? He didn’t want to accept
that he was defeated by a nobody like him.

Phillip exploded in rage.

“How dare you!!”

A light brown magic circle appeared between Phillip and Isaac.

A 5-star rock spell. As huge stone projectiles shot out of the ground
and walls to attack Isaac—.

“···!!”

From underneath Professor Phillip, a black dagger sheath glowed.

*Kwaaaa———!!*

The sheath shot out ice explosively. In an instant, a sharp ball of ice
formed, and the cave was filled with waves of cold air.

The cold explosion flung Phillip into the air and his body was instantly
imprisoned in ice. His surprised expression seemed frozen in time.

“Let’s consider this as self-defense, okay?”

Isaac spoke while picking up his fallen possession. The Sheath of
Disaster let out a white vapor from the aftermath of its \[Ice
Explosion\]. The message he shamelessly conveyed was that he had no
choice but to attack.

Earlier, he squatted down to secretly put the Sheath of Disaster under
Philip. Isaac was cautious of Philip’s competitiveness which could
result in a sudden attack against him.

The cave, which had once been filled with the heat of Philip’s flames,
was now filled with cold air produced by Isaac’s spell.

Isaac sighed and let his white breath flow like smoke from a cigarette.

Soon thereafter, his ice was defrosted. The sharp ball of ice split and
became blue powder that scattered in the cold wind.

“Ugh…”

*Collapse.*

Phillip’s body collapsed back on the ground.

***With his body bloodied beyond recognition, he finally passed the hell
out.***

Chapter 97: - Joint Practical Evaluation (6)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (6) ༻**

Fourth gate cleared.

I slung Zhonya’s Staff on my back. Everyone had already unsummoned their
familiars.

We passed by an unconscious Professor Phillip as we stepped towards the
arch-shaped door.

“As expected, the plan worked out just as Sir Isaac said. This is the
power of actual experience!”

“We were just lucky.”

It had been a long time since I saw Kaya’s eye sparkle in excitement.

I responded dryly since we only beat a professor who was heavily
handicapped due to the evaluation.

If we fought him at his full power, most of my plans would have been
meaningless.

Even so.

‘Yesss\~.’

All that mattered in the end was the fact that we had passed\~.

Either way, we would never need to fight Professor Phillip again. I
think. I hope.

“So humble! You’re so cool, Sir Isaac!”

“Am I now?”

Too much worship was burdensome, but I grinned like an idiot because
Kaya was way too cute. I pretended to scratch my cheek to hide my smile.

“It was more boring than I thought. It would be more fun to fight a
full-powered Professor Phillip. Or maybe people like Aria or
Headmistress Elena would be okay too.”

Lisetta continued to spout bullshit.

Setting aside an unrestrained Professor Phillip, we would get demolished
if we faced Hegel Magic Tower’s Tower Master Aria or Märchen Academy’s
Headmistress Elena. We’d be dead before we could even land a single hit
on them.

Even so, I didn’t want to destroy Lisetta’s naivety so I let it slide.

After passing the fourth gate, we were led deep into a dark forest. Only
dim lights from lamps were scattered here and there. As such, the forest
emanated an eerie atmosphere.

After a certain point, an engraving on one of the lamps fastened to the
wall caught my eye.

This was the place.

I stopped in place and blocked Kaya with my arms so that she could not
go any further.

“Lisetta, you’re free to leave since you’ve done your part.”

We now had to face the frog demon.

Lisetta only promised to help us until the fourth gate, so it was time
to send her off.

“I was going to leave even if you didn’t say anything. You do you bro.”

After saying this, Lisetta walked away from us into the distance. How
nonchalant of her.

\[Lisetta Lionheart\] **Psychology:** \[Doesn’t want to get in your
way.\]

Sike, I take it back. Her kind psychology was always such a shock to see
because of the contrasting nature between her actions and her
psychology. ***What a tsundere.*** I mean, I guess it was good for me at
least.

I tapped the ground with my foot. This place should be good enough.

I stretched my right arm to the ground and sent my rock mana. On top of
my head, a light brown magic circle engraved itself into the air.

We’re going to go underground. Get ready for landing.”

“Yes, Sir Isaac.”

“Also, from now on, just ignore whatever you see.”

“…What?”

As said before, the frog demon wasn’t that difficult to defeat, but the
process was sooooo tedious.

In the first place, as could be seen in the UI and cut scenes, the
concept behind ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was violent fairy tales.
Perhaps because of this, all the demons were grotesque.

Even that useless demon, whose sole purpose was to be defeated in order
to prevent an Extra Bad Ending, was disgustingly detailed. It seemed
like this horror genre was practically a natural setting of the game.

I warned Kaya in advance. However, she exclaimed that she wanted to go
with me regardless. She said she wanted to directly experience my
hardships for herself.

‘Oh well, as the saying goes, seeing it once is more impactful than
hearing it a hundred times.’

「Rock Avalanche (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Crash—!*

A thick stone pillar extended from the ceiling as it demolished the
ground.

The ground sank beneath us with a rumble.

Kaya and I felt weightless as we fell deep underground.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★)」

*Hoooooo—!*

Kaya brought forth a light green gale that densely swirled around our
bodies.

As if we were on an invisible elevator, we slowly glided into the
underground.

“Uh, uh…?”

An endlessly vast expanse of land lay within this underground chamber.

It was like we journeyed to the center of the earth and ended up in an
entirely new world. It was hard to believe that this unbelievable view
was actually a cave.

*Ssak–.*

Within this underground cave, there were countless guillotines organized
in rows.

Numerous blades from these machines sliced through the air as it fell.

Shortly after, an indecipherable power tugged the blades back up.

The blood on the blades was purple as it dried like a rusty scab. Every
time the guillotines fell and were pulled back up, fresh blood could be
seen splattering the wooden platforms.

\[Ribbit–.\]

\[Ribbit….\]

\[Ribbit! Ribbit–!\]

Tied to the guillotine was a human-shaped figure with arms and legs.
However, instead of making any discernible human noises, it was
ribbiting like a frog.

The skin was a pale green. The head seemed to be forcefully stretched
apart laterally. The face was swollen and the lips were torn apart so
widely that it matched the length of its hair.

It was bent over naked, with only the head tied to the guillotine. It
seemed to be groaning in pain.

*Squirm.*

The guillotine easily decapitated the frog creature. Every time it did
so, the body that was firmly restrained on the guillotine squirmed.

The head flew away as it landed on the ground to join its comrades.

When this happened, the stump, which used to house a head, started to
wriggle like a worm as something popped out. The head grew back, once
again ready for the inevitable conclusion.

Shortly thereafter, the blades of the guillotine mercilessly fell as it
cut off the head once again.

“What is this…”

Kaya covered her lips in shock. Her eyes were trembling.

***See, I told you she would be like this.***

A sloppy sound echoed as we stepped on the ground. This was obviously
the case. After all, the ground was littered with the heads of a
grotesque frog creature.

And in between every head, purple-colored blood flowed like a river.

It was a bit grotesque, but as one of the OG try-hards of the game, it
didn’t impact me that much. I already knew it would be like this from
seeing it multiple times in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

***…Yeah, but I had to admit, it’s still pretty disgusting.***

“Are you o-?”

Right when I turned towards Kaya to reassure her, I flinched at the
sight of her expression.

As she slowly let her hands fall from her mouth, I was able to clearly
see her face. A transparent liquid ran down the corners of her mouth.

She was drooling.

She looked like a person who had found a bountiful feast after starving
to death from hunger. As if mesmerized, she continued to unblinkingly
stare at the heads flying off the monsters’ bodies.

An ominous chill ran down my body.

‘Why is she like this?’

***Is she okay? Did you eat something wrong? What’s wrong with her?
Heh?***

“Kaya?”

“Ah, yes, Sir Isaac. *Slurp.*”

As if she regained her sanity from hearing my voice, she quickly slurped
back the drool around her mouth.

“I apologize for showing such an embarrassing sight. The drool just
started coming out so suddenly…”

Okay, this was not normal.

***Is this reaction a result of Dark Kaya hiding deep inside her
heart?***

“…Let’s just go.”

For now, killing the frog demon was my top priority. I’d have to think
about Kaya’s situation at a later date.

“Y-yes…!”

I started walking together with Kaya. Every time we took a step, the
floor of heads squished with a disgusting texture.

In our ears, we heard continuous squishes as each slice decapitated
another head.

Short screams similar to the ribbiting of frogs echoed throughout the
chamber.

I ignored this and continued to march forward.

This was the unique magic of the frog demon. Usually, the frog demon
appeared in different locations every day, However, at least for the day
of the joint practical evaluation, he seemed to want to mark its
territory while enjoying the torture of his own subordinates.

The area was unable to be magically perceived similar to the illusion
magic that Leafa the Illusive and Marlog the Envious used. However, the
amount of mana contained was far less.

How tedious. This demon was so weak that I shouldn’t have even needed to
bother with him. Besides the Extra Bad Ending that he caused, his
existence meant absolutely nothing. The game developers probably put him
in just to farm content… I mean, it doesn’t make any sense. Even the
upcoming conflicts with the Floating Island, Pillar Demons, and the
Abyssal Monster don’t cause Extra Bad Endings! Why was this bastard
lucky enough to get one?

Whatever. Let’s just move on. Oh, by the way, it seemed like the frog
demon finally noticed that there were intruders.

On this vast platform made of heads, the bastard’s subordinates finally
regained control of their bodies after having their heads continuously
blown off. Individually, they were weak, so they must be trying to gang
up on us as a group.

For reference, these subordinates were fake existences made of mana, so
they did not provide any EXP. As such, I only need to eliminate the frog
demon, ‘Milo the Yearner’.

“Sir Isaac, is it… that?”

“Yep.”

As we walked past the guillotines, we finally saw an amphibian that was
draped in elegant garments.

Standing at a height of 2m, his face was stretched wide to the sides and
his arms and legs were identical to a frog. He was naturally bipedal,
just like a human.

His skin color was a green so dark that it was closer to black. A little
crown was on his head and the red cape on his shoulders blew in the
wind.

His attire did not suit the surrounding environment of blood, heads, and
guillotines.

The bastard stopped in place and looked at us with pupilless eyes.

\[Milo the Yearner\] **Lv:** 100

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Water

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to be off with your head.\]

‘As expected, I found him quickly.’

It was the frog demon, Milo the Yearner.

\[RIBIIIIIIIIIIIT!!\]

Milo the Yearner opened his huge mouth and let out an explosive cry.

Does he want to burst his vocal cords or something? If you want to hurt
yourself that badly, do it when on you’re own time. My ears hurt, you
bastard.

Whatever, forget it. All I needed to do now was eliminate him and I
would complete my goal.

*Click─.*

*Click─.*

*Click─.*

After Milo the Yearner’s cry, the restrained frog creatures were
released from their guillotines.

\[RIBIIIIIIIT!!!\]

The frog demon Milo opened his mouth even wider to let out a sound
similar to a gargle. It was a signal to attack.

His subordinates started to charge towards us, combining blue and black
magic circles to create joint spells.

***Is this all they got? I could beat them in my sleep.***

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[Your level and stats are temporarily
greatly enhanced!\] \[Your skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

The only thing this useless demon could do anyway was dirty up the mood
with his ugly face.

***Eh, I’ll just quickly deal with this clown, so that I can go back
home. I don’t even need Zhonya’s Staff to put him in his place.***

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Pshook! Kwaaah—!*

The pale blue magic circle above my head blasted a thick ice spear
toward the frog demon.

Pale blue cold air left after images in the form of flames.

\[Ice Spear\] instantaneously approached Milo’s body before he could
even blink.

*Boom—!*

A sound similar to a bomb exploding reverberated.

As the shockwave spread, a huge hole could be seen in Milo’s torso. It
was the place that was pierced by \[Ice Spear\].

Milo fell down after letting out a \[Ribbit…\].

I absolutely fodderized him.

“…Hm?”

***…What’s that?***

Before Milo turned to dust.

As he twitched while awaiting death, a pool of blood suddenly appeared
underneath his body.

*Gururururu—.*

Blood magic was healing Milo. However, it was only to the point of
preventing death.

It was the magic of Dark Kaya.

I looked towards Kaya. Her eyes were bright red. Dark Kaya had switched
into her body.

As if she was in a fever dream, she swallowed her drool as she stared
hungrily at Milo.

“Ka-?”

“Hah.”

A sticky breath was released from her both.

Both of Kaya’s cheeks burned red, as she excitedly gushed out breath
after breath.

And then.

*Kuaaaahk—.*

A skull made of blood burst out of the puddle underneath Milo the
Yearner and swallowed him completely. His existence disappeared without
a trace.

*Booom—!*

Shortly after, waves of blood exploded out from the ground like a
geyser.

“The fuck? What’s happening?!’

The magic condensed the blood, creating numerous skull-shaped figures.

“Hap.”

*Fuoooooooo—!*

When Kaya opened her mouth, the blood skulls copied her action and began
to swallow the frog creatures.

Like a tsunami, blood spread widely and roughly devoured the decapitated
heads scattered on the ground.

Her intense blood-colored magic feasted on everything, from the ceiling
and floor to the guillotines that remained.

The grotesque surroundings disappeared as an empty cave was all that was
left behind.

Kaya suddenly started chewing something in her mouth, while letting out
both crunches and squishy sounds. As if she was eating delicious food,
she continued to savor the taste until finally swallowing it down her
throat.

“Fuah…”

Kaya rubbed her flushed cheeks as she let out a satisfied smile.

Her expression was reminiscent of a starving individual who was finally
able to fill their stomach.

<span id="0096_98_-_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 98: - Joint Practical Evaluation (7)
============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (7) ༻**

In a cave covered in ice and a frigid chill.

Second year student, Eve Ropenheim, could not believe what she had just
witnessed.

Two female students far stronger than Eve skillfully worked together
with Isaac to fight against Professor Phiillip.

Isaac even used 5-star spells nonchalantly and earned a complete
victory, allowing him to clear the fourth gate with ease.

Now… it reached a point where she questioned whether that was actually
her younger brother.

Eve stealthily chased after Isaac’s group.

Since the messenger was destroyed, there was no one watching her
currently, even if staff members were approaching this location.

*Kwang!*

She was startled at the sound of someone breaking apart the earth from
far away.

She steeled her heart as she slowly walked out of the cave.

“…!”

Eve froze in her tracks.

It was because a magic that was strong enough to give her goosebumps
brushed past her skin.

As she walked farther, she found a hole that led deep underground.

Before she was able to examine it.

“Heuk…!”

Eve saw something squirming from inside as it engulfed the inside of the
hole.

*Kwarereuk—!*

A spell colored in a shade of red wine shined as beautifully as a ruby

For Eve, however, its beauty only struck fear in her.

“Keuk!”

Eve jumped back in surprise as she landed on her butt.

She blocked her mouth with both hands in fear of letting out a sound.

***What… What exactly is going on down there?***

The spell suddenly calmed.

Eve carefully looked into the hole. As she looked down, she only saw a
very normal-looking underground cave.

Cold sweat ran down her face as Eve swallowed dry spit.

Below the hole in the silent cave… something dangerous awaited.

\* \* \*

As my unique trait \[Hunter\] deactivated, my body became heavy and my
mana considerably decreased.

How do I put it… It was as if a healthy young man became old and weak in
a heartbeat.

*Ring─♪*

I waved away the ‘Level Up’ system message that appeared. Since I made
the biggest contribution in eliminating the frog demon, I should have
gotten a considerable amount of experience from it.

Additionally, Isaac’s elder sister would not have been able to follow me
here. Unless she had also cleared the fourth gate, the messenger would
have blocked her way.

Therefore, I only needed to focus on one thing.

‘This girl is the only problem left.’

Dark Kaya’s vicious appetite.

The Kaya in front of me was in her dark persona. I was starting to
understand why Kaya the Ravenous decided to hide deep within Kaya’s
heart.

In the main story of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Dark Kaya was never able
to taste any demons, so her appetite never changed drastically.

However, in the Bad Ending 「Demon Queen」, Kaya clearly showcased her
ravenous appetite.

True to her name, Kaya the Ravenous ate anything and everything that she
could get her hands on. As she grew in power, she became the most
heinous demon.

‘The Kaya right now has already eaten Elphelt the Evanescent as well.’

Just like how a domestic animal, such as a puppy, instinctually became
more wild and feral after tasting blood.

There was no doubt that after getting a taste of a demon, Kaya also
started to reveal her gluttonous nature as her appetite for demons grew.

Therefore.

‘Was the reason for Dark Kaya hiding in the depths of Kaya’s heart
because of her increase of appetite?’

Perhaps Dark Kaya instinctively felt the danger.

It made total sense if this was the reason why Kaya had been so hungry
lately while never being able to feel completely satisfied.

“Kaya.”

“I apologize for not being able to tell you, Sir Isaac.”

She had an apologetic look on her face.

“I wasn’t too certain even until yesterday… but now I understand
clearly. I guess I have these sorts of bodily needs now. At least I
finally satisfied them for a bit.”

She must have had a lot of concerns and doubts about her body after
feasting on all those demons.

As such, I could understand why she looked so disturbed.

“…Is that so.”

“Huh? That’s it…?”

Kaya seemed to have been surprised since I replied without much of a
reaction.

“Since we’re done, let’s go back.”

“Sir Isaac. I said I ate dem-”

“I know.”

“Huh?”

I turned around and started walking. She stood there, dazed for a
moment. Her face looked like she couldn’t fully comprehend why I was
being so casual about it.

I mean, there wasn’t much to say anyway. I had already processed
everything.

‘Yoooo demon eating power-up? That’s a win-win.’

***What’s wrong with eating demons? She ate it with magic anyway so why
would I get disgusted?***

Anyway, if Kaya could get even stronger and fight the final boss with
me, I couldn’t have asked for a better situation than this.

I guess there could be a problem after defeating the Evil God Nephid.
Actually, that wasn’t really the case either.

All she would need to do was eat meat with a high density of mana. The
Astrea household should also have an easy time obtaining it as well. I
didn’t really see a problem with this arrangement.

***Although this was embarrassing to say, she could even use the semen
of a man with powerful mana to satisfy her hunger. Drinking it from
either one of her lips would do the trick.***

‘After all, this setting was hinted at during the gameplay of ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.’

As such, there was no need to be concerned about the demonic appetite
that her ravenous side possessed.

“Uh, do you not feel disgusted hearing that?”

“Why would I be disgusted?”

“I ate demons just n-”

“And? I’m not disgusted or concerned so don’t worry.”

“…”

Kaya tilted her head as she seemed to ponder deeply about something. In
the next moment, she brightened up with a smile as she giggled.

It seemed like she was deeply relieved that her concerns were unfounded
and quickly resolved.

As she walked beside me, Kaya glanced up mischievously.

“Then, Sir Isaac, since I helped you kill a demon, can I have a reward?”

“What kind of reward?”

“Holding my hand, kissing me on the cheek, wrapping me in your arms…!
And much more if you so desire…”

Whispering in a sly tone, Kaya softly touched her lower lips with her
slender index finger.

Her unique cutesy voice was the same as always.

“Restrain yourself.”

“…You’re so mean.”

She seemed to be disappointed at my emotionless reaction as her lips
started pouting.

Like that, Kaya stared at me for a while.

Then, she suddenly tilted her head towards me and let out a satisfied
smile.

“I love you even when you act like this.”

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Psychology:** \[in love with you.\]

Every time I used \[Psychological Insight\] on Kaya, I always flinched
in surprise.

I couldn’t possibly hate it when one of my favorite characters liked me
this much.

“She’s soooooooooo damn cute…”

I carefully hid my grin to appear casual on the outside.

However, on the inside, my mind was in turmoil and I was singing the
national anthem to try and calm my racing heart.

“…Sir Isaac!”

Right when I was enjoying the moment, I suddenly felt magic rushing us.

「Ice Spear (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Pshook—!*

“…!”

A spear formed from ice flew towards Kaya from above!

It was such a sudden and unexpected event.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whooooosh—!*

Kaya channeled wind through her body as she quickly dodged.

\[Ice Spear\] penetrated the ground. Judging by the angle, it was aimed
a bit away from where Kaya previously was.

Thankfully, it looked like it wasn’t meant to make a Kaya kebab.

“Isaac!”

At that moment, I could see silver-blue hair flowing in the air.

From the ceiling, a uniformed female student had wind wrapped around
herself as she glided down. When she landed, she quickly stood between
me and Kaya.

Silver-blue ponytail tied to the side. Deep red eyes.

‘Elder sister?’

Isaac’s older sister appeared out of nowhere.

\[Eve Ropenheim\] **Lv:** 87

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Ice, Wind

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Intends to protect you from Kaya Astrea.\]

Eve had her back faced towards me as she cautiously analyzed Kaya.

“Isaac, are you okay?!”

***Okay or not, who do you think you are to even ask me that…?***

‘What happened to the messenger? How did she chase me all the way here?’

Judging from the timing, there was no doubt that Eve had come here
without even clearing the fourth gate.

But the messenger should have blocked her… Wasn’t it impossible for her
to be here?

‘…No way, did it get destroyed in our fight with Professor Phillip?’

It could be possible since the tug-of-war between Professor Phillip and
Kaya was extensive and powerful.

Why was it made so flimsy?

“I can’t believe an existence with such sinister power… was hidden in
the academy.”

“Uh, what do you think you’re doing?”

“N-no, what do you think you’re doing…!?”

It felt bizarre to me.

I could not understand why she suddenly appeared now of all times when
she had been stalking me since forever ago.

Kaya’s eyes started to fill with killing intent. However, Eve squashed
her rising fear and maintained eye contact with Kaya.

“S-someone like you doesn’t scare me at all okay?! Do you know Helga the
Two-Headed Dog? That ferocious magic beast is my familiar! Also, I-i
have 7-star protection on me, you know? If you lay a hand on me, uh, my
subordinates hidden in the academy will know who you are! I also have
reflection magic on me! I’m dangerous, okay?! If you attack me, you’re
dead!”

Her way of speaking was so childish…!

It was so obvious that everything she said was a lie.

Unfortunately, Eve’s voice was trembling as much as her legs were so she
sounded extremely unconvincing.

*Whoooosh—.*

Kaya’s light green wind started to aggressively stir the surrounding
area.

It was magic so intense that its mere pressure felt like it would be
enough to squash her. Eve must have felt terrified since her body
started trembling even more violently.

“…You seem to keep talking about me as if I’m a bad person.”

“Y-you! Fuah! Y-you are just my junior! How dare you! Why don’t you hide
that ominous magic first? I felt enormous amounts of it earlier. I
sensed an aura of a demon and it’s obvious that your mana is reminiscent
of a demon as well. It doesn’t take much to put two and two together.
You’re a demon, right? Right, the Black Monster is also considered a
demon…! You’re the Black Monster, aren’t you?!”

Hearing Eve theorize conspiracy after conspiracy made my head pound. My
hand automatically rose to face-palm myself.

Eve Ropenheim.

A silver-blue ponytail tied to the side and crimson eyes. From my
memories, she was an NPC that everyone hated due to her pathological
lies and delusional nature.

Her two eyes were always lifeless and she never appeared sane.

When she mentioned Helga the Two-Headed Dog, I recalled a cringe-worthy
scene where she proudly showed a doll with two heads and proceeded to
make it growl with her own voice.

***Obviously, no one remained within her vicinity. She always was, is,
and will be a loner.***

‘Isn’t her condition way better than what was shown in the game though?’

The lies she was spouting right now could be considered cute. She looked
nothing like the version of her in-game self, who was a pitiful person
with her sanity already in shambles.

She pointed the staff in her hand towards Kaya.

Actually, because her hand was shaking too much, she had to grasp it
with both hands.

Although her body was drenched in fear, her two eyes remained resolute.
It looked like she had no intention of backing off.

“Do you think I would ever trust a demon?! I don’t know what kind of
nasty plot you’re planning, but if you touch my younger brother… I will
never forgive you.”

‘…Eh?’

***What is this?***

I fell into deep confusion.

She won’t forgive anyone who laid a hand on me? It clearly meant that
she was on my side.

‘Weren’t we on bad terms though?’

Isaac hated his older sister. I didn’t know the exact situation, but the
emotions I felt during the Trial of Frost could not be mistaken.

***Is there… some kind of misunderstanding?***

Let’s think about that later. At the very least, I had already
deciphered the current situation.

I should probably fix this first.

“I don’t know who you are but… I can’t accept that you attacked me out
of nowhere and tried to take Sir Isaac away from me. No matter what
reasoning you bring forth, you are the one crossing the line right n-”

“This person is my elder sister.”

I put a hand on Eve’s shoulder and spoke clearly.

“Heuk?”

Eve let out a shocked exclamation as she looked towards my face in
embarrassment. She must have been startled when I touched her.

“…Pardon?”

Kaya replied with a puzzled look on her face as if she failed to
comprehend the situation.

For a while, her head rotated as she looked at both me and Eve
alternatively. After noticing that we had similar features, her jaw
dropped.

Soon thereafter, her expression morphed into one of horror.

As if she had sinned greatly, her complexion turned utterly pale.

<span id="0097_99_-_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 99: - Joint Practical Evaluation Interlude
==================================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation Interlude ༻**

Thanks to the Trial of Frost, I was able to decipher Isaac’s fragmented
memories that remained in my mind.

Isaac and his elder sister, Eve Ropenheim, had different biological
fathers.

Isaac’s mother fell in love with Baron Ropenheim, having been swooned by
his romantic courtship, and even had a baby with him.

However, she and her child were abandoned by Baron Ropenheim, the sole
reason being that her pregnancy was unsightly. Basically, he didn’t like
how she got fat because of the child in her womb.

As such, she was exiled to a shabby house in the countryside and
subsequently gave birth to their daughter, Eve.

For Isaac’s mother, who was lost in sorrow and the futility of her
situation, Eve was her sole reason to continue living.

Then, she met a commoner, which led to the birth of Isaac. As a result,
Isaac’s mother found another reason to live.

I could remember the backstory of Isaac’s birth, but anything specific
about the past, such as his childhood, was completely blank.

I couldn’t remember where Isaac’s father disappeared to, nor how Eve
Ropenheim reunited with her biological father, Baron Ropenhem…

***Of course, I’m sure it’s not a very happy story to hear.***

‘Anyway.’

No matter how trashy Baron Ropenheim was, what kind of mental trauma
Isaac’s mother endured, and who Eve really was, that was an Isaac
problem, not a me problem.

My problem laid in the present. So let’s try to summarize the current
situation.

As mentioned before, given Eve’s safe arrival here, the messenger from
the fourth gate must have lost its ability to properly function.

Therefore, the academy staff would be coming to this cave to replace
both the messenger and the professor.

In conclusion, there was no time to relax here and play around.

“Y-yeah! That’s right! I’m his elder sister!”

Eve’s arrogant shout came out awkwardly.

Before Kaya could say something, she broke out into a cold sweat…

I slipped my index finger to my lips, signaling her to remain silent.

Kaya, who was still in shock, managed to regain her reason.

It seemed as if my silent instruction to stay quiet had been delivered
properly,

‘First of all, if I correctly deduced what this elder sister said
earlier, then…’

Eve did not know the specific circumstances of what Kaya and I did.

Moreover, she did not see the frog demon’s territory but was able to see
Kaya’s blood magic. It meant that she was most likely quite a distance
away from Milo the Yearner.

That meant…

‘She must have been outside the hole that I made earlier.’

The mana of Dark Kaya was at a level where even Eve could accurately
sense it.

As such, I should just gaslight her into thinking that she was mistaken
because of Kaya’s immense magical prowess. It would be ideal to gloss
over this matter using this as an excuse.

“And also, who do you think you’re treating as a demon right now?”

“…Huh?”

I put on a calm expression and looked down at Eve from a close distance.

***By the way, this elder sister is hella nervous.***

“Kaya has a rare and strong element. Earlier, she saved me by destroying
a trap that I was almost caught in. I appreciate the reason you stepped
up to help me, but don’t accuse or insult Kaya. Now, go back. You
haven’t even cleared the fourth gate yet.”

“That, how did you know…?”

“Did you think I wouldn’t notice that you were tailing me?”

Eve hiccuped in shock.

“The timing doesn’t match after all. It doesn’t make any sense that you
were able to clear the fourth gate so quickly while reaching all the way
here as well. Why did you even follow me?”

“W-well… It couldn’t be helped… Uh, um… I was just trying to help! Yeah,
I was helping you! If you fell in danger in a place like this, if I
didn’t step forward and help, you would be in big trouble! After all,
you’re w… e… ak…?”

***I don’t think I’m weak enough to be protected by a level 87
though…***

Eve’s voice slowly died out. She probably spat those words out and
realized soon after that ‘That ain’t it Chief’.

Anyway, it wasn’t too hard to notice that she was genuinely concerned
about my well-being, even among the careless and argumentative words she
used.

‘She seems nice on the outside though.’

***I wonder why her relationship with Isaac became so twisted.***

For now, I should quickly finish the current conversation.

I brushed past Eve without answering, pretending to have nothing more to
say.

“Kaya, let’s go.”

At this, Kaya followed beside me.

“Sir Isaac, could you please give me a chance to make up for my
wrongdoings with your elder sister…”

She pleaded with a whisper. Her desperate expression was mournful.

Unfortunately, however, I could not afford to listen to her plea at the
current moment.

As wind magic lifted us up, we left Eve behind and went up the hole.

As we did so, I glanced sideways at Eve.

I was met by a pair of sunken eyes.

\[Eve Ropenheim\] **Psychology:** \[Feels a sense of guilt towards
you.\]

***…I’ll figure this out later.***

I briefly considered having a conversation with Eve while pretending I
had partial memory loss.

‘There probably isn’t a need for that.’

Isaac’s life story started as someone born into an average family of
commoners and ended as someone who took his own life. Wherever Eve was
in that story, it was certain that she did not play a good role in it.

“Isaac!”

At that moment, Eve called out to me.

“After Mom passed away… what happened to you in those two years?”

She must have had many questions after following me today.

‘That’s pretty understandable.’

Isaac was someone who was the weakest, even in his childhood, but he
suddenly showed up in the most prestigious academy on the continent and
even showed skill that was far above average among his peers.

Well, the answer wasn’t that difficult. I didn’t even need to think
about it.

“Nothing happened.”

“…”

Isaac studied to death in order to be acknowledged for his theoretical
excellence. As a result, it allowed him to enter Märchen Academy and
major in Magic Theory.

As such, he probably only studied in the two years he hadn’t met Eve. He
would have isolated himself from the world and only lived by burying
himself in books.

And next to him, during his darkest moments, Eve wasn’t there.

At the end of that short conversation, Kaya and I started to ascend up
the hole once again.

We started to head towards the fifth gate when Kaya started pleading
with me with a pitiful expression.

“Sir Isaac, could you please turn back time just once…? If it’s Sir
Isaac, wouldn’t it be easy to do so…?”

\[Kaya Astrea\] **Psychology:** \[Depressed because she ruined her first
encounter with her sister-in-law.\]

***…Sorry, that would be difficult to do.***

\* \* \*

“Sigh…”

The reunion with my younger brother was absolutely dreadful.

Eve was alone and lost her thoughts.

She was certain now. It may seem unbelievable but Isaac’s mind, body,
and ability to handle magic were all different from before.

He was just a lacking boy who was bullied by the children in his
hometown for being useless in magic.

The Isaac who had always been weak to his very bones was nowhere to be
seen.

Now, only a reliable and talented young man could be clearly reflected
in Eve’s eyes.

‘Perhaps…’

He must have endured all kinds of sorrow and managed to mature, using
his heartache as a stepping stone.

After their mother had passed away, Isaac abandoned his shabby house and
disappeared to live alone.

As such, Eve was only able to reunite with him today because both of
them were academy students taking the same evaluation.

Eve couldn’t even begin to imagine how much blood, sweat, and tears it
took for him to change so drastically.

Her heart squeezed painfully and her throat choked with tears. To Isaac,
Eve was someone who couldn’t even play the role of an older sister
properly,

While Isaac improved himself alone through so much grief, Eve had done
nothing for him.

Instead, all she did was put a nail in her younger brother’s heart,
hurting him even greater in his time of suffering.

Eve let out a deep sigh.

“But…”

While feeling despondent, Eve looked up at the hole, It was high up from
the ground where she stood.

“How do I get out of here…?”

The cold reality drew Eve out of her thoughts.

She had overused her wind magic while chasing after Isaac and had even
attacked Kaya, so her mana was already depleted.

She should’ve bore the shame and asked Isaac to carry her out too. Eve
regretted it already.

\* \* \*

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 82

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 1st

**Title:** Eager First Year

**Mana:** 12000/12000

– Mana Recovery Speed (B)

Autumn had begun to show. The streets of the academy were filled with
students wearing uniforms that were gradually becoming thicker.

The cold season was already creeping closer. It was not long before the
Floating Island would appear.

Before that, I wanted to be strong enough to ensure that I could
successfully solve the problems regarding the Floating Island.

If nothing happened any time soon, I wouldn’t have to worry about the
bad ending, so I could train in peace.

“Hooo.”

*Boom—!*

*Crash–!*

The academy training grounds.

I was eliminating demonic illusions with elemental magic.

Now that I have outgrown the title of the weakest, no student tried to
have a useless quarrel with me over my skills.

On the contrary, more students seemed to admire me while I was training.
It seemed like my performance with Zhonya’s Staff was quite the
spectacle to see. It honestly made me feel vain as my shoulders
stiffened with pride.

The results of the joint practical evaluation landed me in 30th place,
thus passing the exam. Considering the time it took me to kill the frog
demon, my performance was a lot better than I expected.

‘Though I did use some tricks.’

Of course, my game knowledge played a big role.

If I had taken the evaluation purely based on my own skill and without
any game knowledge, I would have placed in the middle of the pack or, at
best, in the middle high.

I felt sorry for Kaya. I was sure she wanted to beat Luce.

However, she just smiled and let the matter go, saying that her desire
to win couldn’t be compared to the peace of the academy.

The one drawback was that Eve Ropenheim got a bad impression of her
because of their brief conflict.

Whenever there was talk about Eve, I could see tears glistening around
Kaya’s eyes.

She said it was the first time in her life that she wanted to turn back
time so badly.

Incidentally, she asked me if I was hiding my identity from my family as
well, so I vaguely confirmed her suspicions.

She must have been surprised that my elder sister, Eve Ropenheim, was so
unexpectedly ordinary.

Kaya’s parents were a swordmaster and a genius wizard so I guess she was
looking forward to seeing how extraordinary my family would also be.

In addition.

‘How long is Isaac’s elder sister going to follow me around?’

After the joint practical evaluation, Eve hadn’t spoken a word to me.

However, when I occasionally checked my surroundings with
\[Clairvoyance\], I could easily witness her stalking me. I didn’t think
she was currently at the training ground though.

I was pretty sure that we would have a conversation sometime in the near
future.

‘It bothers me…”

On the day my journey to defeat the Evil God comes to an end…

It was not known if I would return to my original world or remain in
this world.

Of course, I was only human so there were certainly times when I missed
my family back in my original world.

Therefore, I had a selfish desire to get closer to Eve, the only blood
relation I had in this world.

‘I guess I don’t need to try to that extent though.’

***I don’t even know Isaac’s childhood at all.***

What kind of relationships Isaac had, the specifics behind how he got
along with Eve, and what memories he had…

However, that didn’t mean that I wanted to start digging into Isaac’s
past.

It wasn’t too late to worry about such things after I took down the Evil
God.

For now, in order to defeat the Floating Island, I needed to focus on my
training with several times the efficiency I usually had.

And so, I trained every day.

Even when I got a nosebleed, I did not stop practicing my magic,

I asked Dorothy to use buff magic on me so that I could forcefully
recover my condition and train again and again.

I applied what I learned in classes and books into repetitive practical
training.

I even rationed my sleep time and as I trained like crazy….

Ten days later, the accumulated fatigue overlapped.

*Collapse.*

***In a moment, I suddenly lost consciousness.***

<span id="0098_100_-_The_Door.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 100: - The Door
=======================

**༺ The Door ༻**

I felt numb.

If I recall my vague memories correctly, I probably collapsed while
training.

It seemed like I was too overconfident in my body, so I had trained to
my very limit. My stamina must have worn out.

‘Where am I right now?’

Deja vu hit me. I felt a soft sensation on the back of my head. It
seemed like I was laid in a place that gave me nothing but comfort.

I remembered the time when I had Eden attack me to test the Elemental
Bracelet.

When the damage accumulated and I fainted, I woke up in Luce’s room.

This time as well, it seemed as if someone dragged my unconscious body
elsewhere. Was it Isaac’s elder sister who had been stalking me these
days?

‘…Nah, there’s no way.’

Before I fainted, I remember scanning the area with \[Clairvoyance\].
Isaac’s sister was nowhere to be seen.

In other words, it was someone else.

By the way, the pillow on my head was so smooth and soft. Wait, I
thought it was a pillow but…

***…What… is this?***

My brain was still unable to function at maximum capacity because I had
just regained consciousness.

I slowly opened my eyes. I thought I would see an unfamiliar ceiling.

Instead, I almost went blind from the brilliant radiance that greeted
me.

“Are you awake, President?”

Beyond the vast valleys of her chest, a smile as bright as starlight
shone in my eyes.

Lavender hair flowed while an entire universe shone in her eyes which
were adorned with her signature star-shaped pupils.

It was Dorothy’s face full of smiles.

In a corner of the butterfly garden, under a zelkova tree with the light
of the sunset falling from the heavens above.

The location where Dorothy would come to sit and talk while I was
training.

In this place, I appeared to be lying on Dorothy’s lap.

‘Oh what, it was Dorothy.’

***Yep, I’m never getting up.***

I closed my eyes again and turned to the side. The skin of my favorite
waifu caressed my cheek.

“Nihihi, Presideeeent\~. Aren’t you being a little too obvious?”

Dorothy grinned widely at the sight of my actions.

“This big sis will get slightly embarrassed, you know?”

“This is not an opportunity that comes often so I must enjoy it as much
as possible. It’s fan service, right?”

“Sure. How is it? Are you happy?”

***Of fucking course I am.***

“What happened to bring about this sudden event? It’s unexpected for you
to give me a lap pillow after all.”

“…These days, I feel like the President is pushing himself too hard.
Both your mind and your body.”

It seemed like it was impossible to hide my emotions from Dorothy.

She must have noticed my sense of urgency.

“How did you know?”

“Hmph, this big sis knows everything you know?”

Dorothy answered triumphantly as she placed a hand over her heart.

“That’s why this big sis wanted to come bother you a bit as a way to
lift your spirits! I found the President unconscious right on time. You
did well fainting!”

***So I lost consciousness at a good time. Noice.***

Of course, I couldn’t enjoy this happy moment forever.

I was blessed to have even had this brief moment of bliss.

Since my stamina should have been supplemented by me fainting, I should
start training once again.

“Thank you so much, Senior. Now I should…”

“President.”

When I tried to raise my upper body, Dorothy grabbed my shoulders and
pressed me back onto her lap.

As if to tell me not to get up.

“Rest, at least for now. Stay with me.”

I hesitated since I didn’t know what to say.

“Good boy.”

Dorothy whispered in a soothing voice as she stroked my hair like I was
a beloved doll.

As if she was roleplaying a mother, a faint smile adorned her face.

Her voice and smile made me feel at ease.

“…”

***Take a rest, you say…***

In the hell difficulty of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had been racing
ahead without rest to defeat the Evil God.

The only time that I had some form of leisure was on the night of the
social gathering, after eliminating Marlog the Envious.

To be honest, this was a bit of an obvious thing to say but…

***It’s tough.***

If I was going to transmigrate into this game…

I wanted to be in the normal difficulty. I wanted to enjoy dating
without any fear of the future and steadily defeat enemies without
needing to rush. It would have been so nice to just take it easy and
enjoy my time…

***…I must be really tired huh?***

My body went slack with exhaustion.

Even if the fainting helped me regain a bit of stamina, I could still
clearly feel that my body was heavily fatigued. I also felt the mana in
my body flowing roughly instead of the smooth current it would normally
have been.

It seemed as if every cell in my body was on strike.

Maybe I couldn’t be an ironman just yet.

“…Okay then.”

Dorothy’s touch was so gently and pleasant that my body languidly
slouched into her.

I quietly closed my eyes.

“I’m going to rest just for a bit.”

For the efficiency of my training, I decided to take a break for now.

“Yay! Okay!”

Dorothy grinned broadly.

I fell into a deep sleep.

\* \* \*

Isaac had fallen asleep.

Dorothy could not contain her smile as she looked at him sleeping
peacefully with his head on her lap.

Feeling that the slight wind in the air turned cooler, Dorothy took off
her cape shawl and covered Isaac with it to keep him warm.

With that, she started to repeatedly stroke his head gently, using this
chance to administer healing magic to him.

“I really can’t figure you out after all.”

Dorothy was well aware that she was revered as a rare genius who
received the Lord Manhalla’s blessing.

But this man lying on her lap was overwhelmingly stronger than Dorothy
herself.

It was an undeniable fact that only someone like Dorothy, who had the
power of \[All In the World\], could know.

In the first place, Dorothy became interested in Isaac because of his
hidden strength.

However, it seemed as if his power was only available when certain
conditions were met.

Dorothy deduced that training also affected his original strength, which
was why he was so desperate to work diligently.

***Even so… Isaac was overdoing it.***

“Even if you’re working hard, there should still be a certain limit to
it.”

Dorothy could feel how hard he worked from sensing Isaac’s twisted mana
circuits.

There must have been a lot of fatigue and pain, to the point where his
body would’ve screamed at him to stop.

And yet, he had been recklessly pouring out mana for the sake of
training…

Dorothy fondly rubbed Isaac’s cheek with her index finger.

He tilted his head towards Dorothy’s finger. He was so cute since he
acted like a puppy.

“Nihihi.”

Although Dorothy maintained a seemingly friendly attitude on the
outside, in reality, she always drew a line between herself and others.

Since she was destined to die soon, she hadn’t let anyone enter her
heart.

It was so that she didn’t have any lingering feelings about this life.

However, whenever she examined Isaac’s mind with \[Emotional Insight\],
he always showed infinite affection towards her.

At first, she came looking for Isaac out of curiosity. However, when she
continued to feel such warm endearment from him, as a human being, her
heart couldn’t help but be put at ease when she was with him.

The sky was slowly losing its light as it dimmed.

Dorothy stared at Isaac while putting her hand on the middle of his firm
chest.

The twisted mana circuit needed to be untangled. When Isaac woke up
earlier, her work was stopped. So now, she had to continue once again.

Dorothy closed her eyes firmly and allowed her mana to flow.

She began to heal Isaac’s mana circuit, which had been twisted from
excessive training.

Since it was Dorothy’s starlight mana, it was fully possible to reach
deeply into Isaac’s mana circuit and restore it completely, starting
from the source itself.

As Dorothy’s mana delved deeper into Isaac’s mana circuit…

“…!”

A scenery of somewhere empty and black filled Dorothy’s sight.

A huge black door letting out a blue chill was lying in the middle of a
black field.

A chill ran down Dorothy’s spine at the sight of its overwhelming
majesty.

Her eyes flew open as she breathed roughly.

“What was that…?”

A drop of cold sweat ran down her face.

Compared to the mysterious Isaac that she knew of thanks to \[All In the
World\], a completely different existence was firmly established in the
source of Isaac’s mana circuit.

In addition, dense amounts of mana flowed around the huge door.

The mana was so powerful, that it was practically on a whole other plane
of existence. This could only be the case after reaching the very
highest level of the ice element. This was the type of mana that was
emanating from the door.

During the first semester, he used otherworldly magic that was on the
level of an apocalypse…

***…Is that not even his full strength?***

“President… how much power are you really hiding…?”

It was obvious to Dorothy that Isaac was overwhelmingly stronger than
her.

Even so… wasn’t this too much? It was too overpowering of a level to
even begin to comprehend.

Isaac was already an existence that could not be contained within this
small and weak world.

Now, she felt a feeling far beyond curiosity… It was simply sheer wonder
at this point.

For a while, Dorothy stared at Isaac with a complex expression. He was
sleeping peacefully without a care in the world.

\*\*\*

**I deeply apologize for last time!**

-Kaya Astrea

“What is this…?”

Dorm for mid-high level students, Elma Hall.

Out in the hallways, Eve Ropenheim stood dumbfounded.

Next to the entrance of her room, there was a bouquet of flowers the
size of a door, various magic tools, an expensive set of snacks, and
even accessories.

So many things were given that… Eve could not even begin to comprehend
the amount that laid strewn alongside her door.

These days, a female student with pale green pigtails, Kaya Astrea,
often approached Eve.

From insisting on rubbing her shoulders with the excuse that her
shoulders were too stiff to calling her beautiful every chance she got,
Kaya continued to ask Eve if there was anything she needed.

She had often heard of Kaya Astrea, the freshman second seat of the
Magic Department, because of her immense reputation. She had the blood
of a swordmaster, Duke Gerald Astrea, and a genius wizard, Historia.
What’s more, even her skill was well-acknowledged….

‘Why is such a noble existence doing this…?”

***How did her younger brother manage to woo such an important
figure?***

Although she felt a bit proud, she fully realized that Kaya was trying
to get in her good graces because of her identity as Isaac’s elder
sister.

As such, she could not treat Kaya carelessly. After all, if she made a
mistake, she’d be done for.

Eve felt increasingly burdensome as she walked into her dorm.

<span id="0099_101_-_Territorial_Fight_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 101: - Territorial Fight (1)
====================================

**༺ Territorial Fight (1) ༻**

After completing her classes at the Magic Department’s Orphin Hall, it
had somehow become Eve’s routine to go searching for Isaac’s
whereabouts.

Whenever she saw him, she couldn’t help but think…

‘This guy really doesn’t do anything other than training…’

Isaac trained during every waking moment. No, really. Literally, all he
did was train the entire day. He genuinely didn’t do anything else.

Even among the highly ambitious students of the esteemed Märchen
Academy, he stood out glaringly due to this excessive diligence.

While secretly tailing her younger brother, Eve frequently overheard
conversations about him among the students.

It seemed as if her brother had gained quite a considerable reputation
among the freshmen.

However, it was more on the negative side.

–‘Hasn’t Isaac been insane lately?’

–‘How did he, who was barely a Grade E in the first semester, manage to
wield a magic weapon already?’

–‘His skills are beyond the standards of Class C. And that guy was at
the bottom of Class D just last semester.’

–‘Was he actually a genius all along? Like one of those prodigies that
gain enlightenment and experience rapid growth?’

‘Isaac was a Grade E…?’

She could never have imagined for this to be the case.

Grade E were people with mana lower than the average person.

The knowledge that Isaac was only at Grade E last semester caused a huge
contradiction with Eve’s memories.

The abilities Isaac demonstrated during the joint practical evaluation
were, at the very least, on the level of Class B.

‘How could someone like that only be a Grade E last semester…?’

From a Grade E, he progressed with an almost frightening growth speed to
reach a mana grade of C+ in only one semester.

She was beyond bewildered as her brain jumbled while trying to process
this new information.

‘Not two years… but he became that strong in just half a year?’

***Is that even possible?***

It had taken Eve two years to wield the wooden staff she was currently
holding. And even then, she struggled to handle it at times.

However, Isaac’s staff seemed much harder to use than hers. As such, it
probably required a significant level of mana control.

It was all but certain that he had reached a level where he could
utilize magic weapons in merely half a year.

‘Could he actually be a genius…?’

There was no way. Eve shook her head in disbelief.

Isaac was certainly not a genius. He was clearly a weakling born with
naturally low mana.

As such, there was definitely some other explanation for this
phenomenon. Something else had undoubtedly facilitated his rapid growth.

Eve was determined to uncover the nature of this existence and what
exactly it entailed.

Dinnertime, Training Grounds.

Eve sat on the second-floor stands that surrounded the dome-shaped
training ground.

She was there to see if Isaac would come today as well.

“Sir Tristan, you were truly impressive during class!”

Voices echoed from the stands nearby.

Suddenly, the chatter of her first year juniors caught Eve’s attention.

“To think even the professor was astonished! It was truly a remarkable
sight!”

“Hah! Of course, it is! Just that much is nothing to me, okay? It was
such basic knowledge that it was positively yawn-inducing!”

“Ugh, I wish I could be in Class B with Sir Tristan. It’s honestly such
a shame that we can’t witness your impressive demonstrations during our
class…!”

Two male students and one female student were excessively praising a
vain blond noble.

Eve wasn’t particularly interested. Märchen Academy had always been
filled with people overflowing with arrogance.

Even she was no different. Of course, in her case, it was just bullshit
from a liar.

Shortly afterward, a man entered the first-floor training grounds where
students were practicing.

‘He’s here!’

It was Isaac. Today, as well, he had Zhonya’s staff slung over his back.

He began pouring mana into various magic circles and proceeded to engage
in battles with demonic illusions.

Today, Eve intended to decipher the secret behind Isaac’s newfound
strength once and for all.

‘I’m not here because I want to see Isaac. I just want to know how he
became so powerful…”

That’s right. She hadn’t come to catch a glimpse of Isaac. Surely not.

“Sir Tristan, that guy…”

“Isn’t that Isaac?”

The blond noble, Tristan Humphrey, leaned against the railing, turning
to look at Isaac.

‘He recognized him immediately, huh?”

Well, it was true that Isaac was infamous. Eve thought that it wasn’t
too big of a surprise that he knew who Isaac was.

However, when Tristan squinted over at Isaac, a deep frown covered his
face.

His expression was a stark contrast to his usual arrogant smirks when
bragging about his accomplishments.

“That commoner bastard… he dares to blatantly train in a place where I
can see him. How audacious of him.”

“Could I give a brief suggestion? How about using this fine chance to
fuck up that commoner bastard that Sir Tristan hates?”

Eve’s face shook a little.

“Looking at that magic weapon, it’s all filler on the inside and only
shiny on the outside. A bastard who was only Grade E being able to
handle a magic weapon? Hah! What a joke.”

“I’m disgusted just by looking at him, ugh.”

“It makes more than enough sense that Sir Tristan hates him. He seems to
have grown confident just because his skills improved a little. Look at
him trying to boast with that worthless staff of his.”

The students who were flattering Tristan aimed their fangs at Isaac. It
seemed as if their goal was to give off a good impression on Tristan by
insulting the person that he hated.

Eve began channeling mana into her wooden staff that had been leaning on
her shoulder.

During her childhood…

Isaac had been so weak that the label of ‘The Worst of the Worst’ suited
him. Because of this, he was often ignored and bullied by meaner kids.

Whenever that happened, Eve would always step forward and protect Isaac.
After all, she was somewhat talented in magic unlike him.

–‘Sis…’

–‘It’s okay now, Isaac. It’s okay now.’

–‘I was so scared…’

–’Just stay by my side. Sis will protect Isaac for the rest of your
life, okay?’

The bastards who dared to lay a hand on her little brother made her
heart burn with anger. She couldn’t stand it.

After all, Isaac, her little brother, was very cute.

If it wasn’t for her promise with Baron Ropenheim, Eve would have gladly
preached to the world just how adorable and lovable Isaac truly was.

‘These brats who don’t even understand Intermediate Element Theory dare
to say such things…’

Her rationality was cast aside.

If they dared to lay so much as a finger on Isaac, Eve was determined to
make these juniors experience the full extent of her wrath, even if it
led to disciplinary action.

Eve’s furious gaze shifted towards Tristan’s group.

And, at that moment, Tristan glanced at his subordinates and clicked his
tongue.

“What nonsense are you spouting, you imbeciles?”

‘Huh?’

For some reason… His reaction was different from what she had
anticipated.

Tristan’s dismissive words towards his lackeys left them bewildered and
speechless.

“Fuck him up? How dare you blabber such nonsensical vulgarity in my
presence?”

“S-sir Tristan…?”

“Engaging in such disgraceful behavior would imply that I think of
myself as weaker than him. I am superior to that bastard in every facet
and ability. Additionally, If there is no fair way to prove that I am
superior to him, I refuse to even consider using underhanded tricks. Do
not tarnish my reputation. Or else.”

Tristan berated them with a voice evident of irritation.

“And as for that weapon, at the very least, it’s a Tier 2 or 3 magic
weapon. How can you not even recognize something as simple as that?
Regardless of how arrogant that commoner may be, the skill needed to
wield it is undeniable. Don’t deny what’s right in front of you.”

“But, Sir Tristan…”

“Hah! My enthusiasm has waned. Join me in my training, you incompetent
fools!”

“Ah, uh! Yes!”

***The hell? What’s wrong with him?***

The sight of Tristan, who seemed to have a twisted yet sane mind,
triggered a strong sense of unease in Eve.

***Until just now, weren’t they trying to torment Isaac…?***

‘He seems like an asshole but he appears unexpectedly sincere…’

Eve regained her composure. There was no need to get angry after all.

Like this, Tristan was brushing past his subordinates when suddenly…

*Crash—-!*

A deafening noise echoed from where Isaac was training, sending
shockwaves to their ears.

Eve jolted, her lips parting in surprise. Tristan, too, halted in his
tracks, while casting a cold, piercing gaze towards Isaac.

The atmosphere grew tense. The students stopped their training, as their
attention diverted towards Isaac.

A tall, muscular figure stood facing him.

The atmosphere felt as if a fight could erupt at any moment.

Given the nature of the sound that echoed previously, it was apparent
that it resulted from a boulder shattering against the force of a punch.
As such, it was easy to search the surroundings and pinpoint where
exactly it came from.

‘V-verga?’

Eve sprang to her feet, her pupils trembling uncontrollably.

An elite member of the Black Tiger, a faction within the Four
Constellations.

His dark green hair was slicked back, and a two-handed axe was slung
over his shoulders.

It was a second year student from the Knight Department, well-known for
his ferocity. It was Verga Rayphelt.

\* \* \*

‘This feels like the ultimate high.’

Thanks to Dorothy’s healing, I felt invincible.

My condition was beyond exceptional as mana surged within me. It seemed
that due to Dorothy untangling my mana circuit, the flow of my mana had
vastly improved.

However, this recovery method placed a significant strain on my body.

From the second time onward, there was a chance that it would weaken my
mana circuit, so I would not be able to rely on it again.

At the moment, I was running a marathon to eliminate the Evil God.

While it was true that I must defeat the Floating Island, it was not my
ultimate goal.

Therefore, proper control of my health and condition was an absolute
necessity.

I finally reached the training ground.

The elemental formations were partitioned by transparent barriers, and
students were engrossed in their own training within their respective
areas.

‘Sweet. Good spot secured.’

Out of the elemental formations, there was a vacant space that looked
perfect.

As I headed over, the surrounding students looked surprised. The reason
was easy to deduce.

‘That’s because a sub-event is triggered here.’

This specific spot was associated with an event that provided EXP.

I should obviously collect as much EXP as possible, shouldn’t I?

Ignoring the students’ stares, I retrieved Zhonya’s Staff and hummed
while readying for battle.

Just like that, I started beating the ever-living hell out of the
demonic illusions.

“…?”

As one wave of illusions was eliminated, I suddenly noticed a shadow
looming over me. A man with a large build stood behind me.

When I turned around, I was met with a tower of dark green hair.

A double-handed axe was slung over his back. He was a physically fit
student who was comparable to the human version of Marlog the Envious.

I recognized him from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

An elite member of the Four Constellation’s Black Tiger faction. He was
the one I had been waiting for.

\[Verga Rayphelt\] **Lv:** 94

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock, Ice

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Resentful towards you for taking his training spot.\]

“…Who do you think you are?”

His voice was accompanied by heavy beast-like breaths.

I remained silent and continued to gaze blankly at him as his fist
swung, striking a nearby boulder.

*Crash–!*

The rock shattered with a resounding boom as it collapsed into
smithereens.

The aftermath of the brief tempest mercilessly blew at my silver-blue
hair.

‘Ooooo…’

Dust and dirt flew into the air. It was the same scene as the event that
I knew.

***After seeing it in reality though, he certainly does pack a punch…***

“Are those two going to fight?”

“He broke a boulder with his fist? Is that even possible?”

“Isn’t that guy Verga? One of the elite members of Black Tiger…!”

“I honestly expected things to turn out this way… Should I have given
him a heads-up? Will he be okay?”

Whispers from the students echoed around me.

“Nevermind, I’m not curious about that. I’m more interested in why a
bastard like you is. Using. My. Spot.”

Verga growled in a low voice.

A sub-event in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ that unfolded during the second
semester of the first year, 「Territorial Fight」.

Starting a week after the conclusion of the joint practical evaluation,
if one trained in the spot that I was currently occupying during
dinnertime, Verga Rayphelt appeared to claim it as his own.

Then, in the game, Ian Fairytale would counter with the argument that
‘monopolizing a spot is unfair’.

As a result, Verga would challenge Ian to a duel, however, the rules of
the duel were far from ordinary.

It was a display of masculinity where they took turns attacking each
other. Whoever lost consciousness first was declared the loser.

Verga, as the senior, would grant Ian the initiative to attack because
he was confident of his basic protection magic and his own resilience.

If Ian defeated Verga in a single hit, the player would win.

However, if he fails, Verga’s following attack would crush him and Ian
would wake up in the infirmary. This event could be repeated until the
player finally won.

A victory would not only yield EXP, but would also pave the way for
advantages in future events.

‘So, the response I should give is…’

With a slightly cheeky expression, I replied nonchalantly.

“There’s no reservation system for spots here. So, why should this
exclusively be Senior’s spot?”

“What…?”

“Senior, it’s not right to monopolize a public training ground.”

The surrounding students appeared horrified at my reply.

The shock was palpable as the sound of gasps reverberated throughout the
training ground..

“Is he insane?”

“Did he lose brain cells? No, does he even have a brain in the first
place?”

“Oh no, his opponent is an elite member of Black Tiger…!”

“Is he looking to die? Is this a new form of suicide?”

In retrospect, if I was in their shoes, I would also lose my mind if I
saw a freshman like Isaac boldly provoking an elite member of Black
Tiger.

“…Arrogant brat. Are you picking a fight?”

Verga’s eyes glinted with murderous intent.

As for me, a faint smirk curled upon my lips.

<span id="0100_102_-_Territorial_Fight_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 102: - Territorial Fight (2)
====================================

**༺ Territorial Fight (2) ༻**

“I wasn’t really picking a fight.”

The veins on Verga Rayphelt’s forehead pulsed in anger.

Verga threw a handkerchief in my direction.

It was a handkerchief with the emblem of Märchen Academy, it was a
symbol of a grimoire, and sword sewn on.

The purpose behind his throw was clear. ‘Come and Face me’.

I caught the handkerchief that fluttered towards me.

“I challenge you to a duel. Fight me like a man, boy.”

Fighting and brawling within the academy could lead to disciplinary
action.

However, dueling in the designated arena was legal. Not only that, it
was actually encouraged.

The reason was obvious.

‘Duels help enhance the practical skills that were needed in an actual
fight.”

Just like any other academy, this place was no different in its teaching
philosophy.

Verga’s voice growled like a wild tiger. His demeanor looked entirely
like a wild beast.

If a situation like this happened in Korea over a study room seat, I
might’ve said something like ‘Why is this your seat?’ and proceeded to
get into an argument.

However, since my purpose here was the sub-event, there was no real need
to engage in a verbal bout.

“If I win, you won’t talk shit later, right?”

The students around were further bewildered, with many letting out
exclamations of shock. Their reactions honestly deserved an Oscar for
Best Performance.

“Hmph! Your spirit is to my liking, boy. I enjoy educating juniors like
you who are lacking in respect.”

Verga lowered his voice with a fierce expression on his face.

“Hey, you.”

“Ugh!”

Verga’s gaze shifted to a male student in an adjacent area.

Seeing as a red brooch hung from his tie, it seemed like he was a
student in the same year as me. He seemed startled by Verga’s call.

“Be the referee.”

“Ah, yes, yes!”

He was threatened with a glare that dared him to refuse.

My fellow schoolmate had no choice but to accept with a fearful
expression.

At least three people were needed for a duel: two duel participants and
one referee who would mediate.

“Follow me.”

With that, Verga and I headed towards the arena.

For some reason… Many students began to follow us as if they were
bewitched by some mob mentality.

‘I’m not some kind of Pied Piper, you know…’

We gradually arrived at our destination. It was close to the training
ground, so it didn’t even take that long.

The arena had three sections in total. Among them, we were going to Duke
Hall, the dedicated arena for Magic Department freshmen.

Inside the grand building itself, it was further divided into four
quarters. In one of these quarters was an arena where Verga and I stood
facing each other from a distance.

Just like ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, spectators for this Verga sub-event
were interspersed among the second-floor stands.

I estimated there were around 30 of them.

Although it was far from filling the entire stands, considering the fact
that there were usually very few people at the arena, it was a decently
large number of spectators.

Presumably, this was because my opponent was an elite member of a
faction within the Four Constellations.

Watching others fight was already entertaining enough, but it was much
more exciting when one of the duelists was a well-known individual as
well.

‘Oh, Tristan and Isaac’s older sister are here too.’

I noticed Tristan Humphrey and Eve Ropenheim as I scanned the stands.

***Were they at the training grounds as well…? Whatever, it’s not
something I should concern myself with, anyway.***

‘Let’s forget about that for now and pay attention to the current
situation… It seems as if some rumors may spread after this.’

Whether I won or lost against Verga, it was likely that the news of our
showdown would spread among the students.

***Eh, it should be okay. Alice won’t get suspicious over something as
trivial as this anyway.***

“Your name?”

“It’s Isaac. I don’t have a last name.”

“I am Verga Rayphelt. Since this is a hassle, let’s do this in a manly
manner.”

“A manly manner?”

I already knew what it meant, however, I had to pretend I was unaware of
his conditions.

“We take turns exchanging one blow each. The one who loses consciousness
first loses. A normal duel is also fine, but wouldn’t it be too pitiful
for you if you’re knocked out without a fight?”

***Of course, it would, my good sir.***

After all, I couldn’t easily defeat Verga in a fair duel.

‘Although, if I have to fight him in one, I should be able to use my
wits to resist him a bit.’

Verga boasted a strength befitting his physique and a speed unexpected
from someone of his size. The probability of me losing was fairly high
in a normal fight.

However, with Verga’s specialized rules of engagement, I had a chance to
accurately strike him with all my might for my first blow.

‘With my current abilities, it’s worth giving it a try.’

I put strength into my right index finger and wiggled it to relax my
tense muscles.

There was also something I wanted to experiment with. Verga would make a
great punchi- test subject.

“Alright, who goes first?”

“I’ll give you the initiative. If you can’t knock me down with a single
hit, you will definitely regret it.”

***…Let’s avoid the conclusion where I wake up in the infirmary at all
costs.***

“Referee! Announce the start of the duel!”

“Ugh! Y-yes! V-verga Rayphelt versus Isaac! Begin duel!”

My fellow classmate raised his right arm to declare the start of the
duel.

Verga glared at me as his bulging muscles twitched with anticipation. He
adjusted his posture and prepared to take my attack.

His strength was his formidable defense, a shocking culmination of
strong basic protection magic, high elemental resistance, and a sturdy
physique.

To clear this sub-event, I had to land a decisive blow that would be
able to pierce through all of these defenses at once.

‘I can’t just grab him by the balls or strike his throat.’

Vulnerable spots such as these were a trap.

This was because Verga’s basic protection magic was the strongest around
such areas.

During my first playthrough of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I naturally
went for any man’s weakness, his groin. However, it was impossible to
deal damage to those balls of steel.

At the same time, however, some areas were relatively less protected by
his basic protection magic.

And out of those areas, one of them also happened to be one of his
weaknesses.

‘But that’s just because the damage can be dealt more deeply compared to
other areas.’

Of course, if one had not surpassed a certain standard, striking this
weakness would still be ineffective.

Additionally, considering Verga’s high elemental resistance, it would
not be a good idea for someone of my level to cast an elemental spell,
even at max power.

***So then, how did our protagonist, Ian Fairytale, defeat him?***

He possessed an outstanding ability that was rare among the Magic
Department students. With that, he defeated Verga.

It was the one thing that a Magic Department student should never use to
directly compete against a Knight Department student.

‘Physical prowess.’

The strategy for this sub-event was to powerfully strike at Verga’s
weakness.

In other words, to achieve victory against Verga, it was necessary to
completely overturn common sense.

Do not ever aim for the weak spots.

Even as a Magic Department student, win against a Knight Department
student using pure physical strength.

As such, I prepared a spell that would increase my physical prowess.
Although there would be a reduction in power due to Verga’s elemental
resistance, it would still be better than hitting him with just my
normal strength.

I placed Zhonya’s Staff on the ground and muttered solemnly.

“Eden, I’m counting on you.”

\* \* \*

“A mere commoner competing for supremacy with an elite member of Black
Tiger? Hah! What a laughable situation!”

Tristan Humphrey, a conceited and vain blond noble, sat with his legs
crossed in the stands, as he observed the confrontation between Isaac
and Verga.

His surrounding subordinates responded in agreement to Tristan’s words.

“Is there even a point in watching? Isaac is going to get thrashed
anyway!”

“Senior Verga Rayphelt of the Four Constellation’s Black Tiger… I heard
that every single Magic Department student who dueled with him was
defeated. His innate elemental resistance is so high that most elemental
spells are meaningless… As a result, since dueling with Magic Department
students was boring, Senior Verga personally created the rule of
striking in turns.”

“He dares to boast without knowing his place in front of such a person…
How pathetic, Isaac.”

Tristan chuckled as his subordinates chattered excitedly around him.

“It’ll be quite the spectacle. Hurry and give me some entertainment with
your pitiful appearance, commoner.”

Tristan’s tone was arrogant as he chuckled to himself.

Considering the humiliation he had suffered against Isaac until now, it
would be an amusing and satisfying sight to see him get demolished by
Senior Verga.

‘Isaac…’

Eve Ropenheim, who sat in the nearby seats, clenched her lips tightly.

She never expected Isaac to actually accept Verga’s challenge.

He could have just refused… He could have just given away the spot…

‘He had too much unnecessary pride… That person’s strength is too much
for Isaac.’

She chewed on her thumbnail anxiously. Eve was fervently praying for
Isaac’s safety.

Before long, the referee declared the start of the duel.

However, for some reason, Isaac placed Zhonya’s Staff on the arena
floor.

***He discarded his weapon!?*** ***Was he at least trying to surrender
before it was too late?***

‘No, the look on his eyes…?’

He was not planning on surrendering. Isaac’s usual gentle expression had
turned incredibly cold with determination.

In a split second.

*Whoosh—!*

“…!”

With tremendous speed, Isaac leaped forward as if bouncing off a spring.

It was a movement that was unbelievably agile for a Magic Department
student.

His athletic capability was far beyond anyone’s expectations. Naturally,
Verga was also caught off guard.

Isaac accelerated towards Verga.

All of a sudden, a circular ring of rocks was partially conjured. A
portion of it floated behind Isaac’s back.

「Rock Armor (Rock Element, ★4)」

Rock skin formed in the air as it attached itself to his right arm.

\[Synchronization\] with Eden was at its max. This allowed him to access
some of Eden’s traits.

***It’s a partial summon.***

A gauntlet made of rock formed on Isaac’s right arm as it glowed a shade
of light brown.

On the gauntlet, lines of golden rock mana glowed as it flowed like
blood in veins.

***\[Rock Armor\].***

The partially summoned power of Eden was perfectly synchronized with
Isaac’s strength. Thus, since it was equipment made from his own mana,
he barely felt its weight at all.

It was only meant to add solidity and power to Isaac’s punch.

‘He’s in the Magic Department, yet he’s planning to win with brute
strength…? Is he out of his damn mind?’

Typically, a wizard would keep the farthest possible distance from their
enemy and unleash spells from afar.

The closer the wizard was to the enemy, the higher their probability of
losing would grow. As such, a wizard was greatly vulnerable when it came
to close combat.

Because of this, when Verga usually dealt with Magic Department
students, they usually scrambled to bombard him with long-ranged spells.

Verga showed mercy by allowing him to take the initiative to pour out a
full-powered spell.

However, Isaac, despite being a Magic Department student, was rushing at
high speeds towards a Knight Department student like him.

Seeing as he equipped \[Rock Armor\] on his right arm, he must have
intended to settle the battle through physical strength.

***It was unthinkable, yet…***

‘Foolish.’

In the end, Isaac was just a student from the Magic Department.

Choosing to fight with brute strength instead of unleashing magic was
akin to discarding a sword and attacking with a wooden stick.

“Try me, you dumbass!”

Verga’s basic protection magic and endurance were top-notch. His muscles
rippled as he prepared himself.

Isaac’s rock fist forcefully slammed itself into Verga’s upper body.

*Boom—!*

“Ugh…!”

A shockwave spread. The noise from the impact was reminiscent of a
firing cannon.

The fist struck Verga’s left rib directly and caved inwards.

Verga’s heavy body momentarily flew in the air.

Blood flowed from his esophagus as it spurted out of his mouth.

Compared to Isaac’s current punch, even a heavy boulder shot from a
catapult would have felt like a small pebble hitting him softly.

The shock was that intense.

“Ughh…”

Verga groaned in pain as he clutched his abdomen with both arms. In the
end, he collapsed while kneeling down.

Isaac stood still as he looked down at Verga.

His gaze was cold as he observed Verga writhing in agony.

Before, everyone had collectively imagined another scene. A scene where
Verga stood over and terrifyingly glared at a destroyed Isaac after
absorbing attacks like it was nothing.

However, the scene unfolding in the arena was the complete opposite of
what everyone had imagined.

The arena was silent.

The students stared in astonishment with frozen expressions.

*Collapse–.*

Verga was drenched in cold sweat while struggling to maintain
consciousness. However, he eventually lost in the end as he fell
unconscious on the ground.

Only then did Isaac close his eyes and dismiss the partial summon of
Eden, \[Rock Armor\]. Only then did the floating ring of rocks behind
him fade away.

‘How…?’

Eve’s eyes were trembling in shock. Tristan and the other students were
in a similar state as well.

Isaac looked towards the referee.

The referee, who had been looking at the unconscious Verga with
disbelief, exclaimed in surprise before raising his left arm.

“D-duel concluded! Isaac wins!”

No one cheered for him. Only heavy silence permeated throughout the
arena.

A system window that only Isaac could see appeared before his eyes.

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 83!\] \[You have gained 2 stat
points!\] \[You have unlocked the achievement ❰One Punch Man❱! You have
gained an additional 15 stat points!\]

Isaac lightly dismissed the system window with a flick of his wrists.

His eyes once again turned gentle as he looked down at Verga and bowed
slightly.

“Thank you for the duel, senior.”

The phrase ‘EXP’ was conspicuously missing from the system message.

Soon after, Isaac quietly left the arena.

The unexpected result overturned everyone’s predictions.

The fact that an elite member of the Four Constellation’s Black Tiger
had been defeated by a Magic Department freshman who wasn’t even in
Class A was an incomprehensible shock to the students sitting in the
stands.

<span id="0101_103_-_Uh_Hey_Uh_Luce_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 103: - Uh Hey, Uh Luce...? (1)
======================================

**༺ Uh Hey, Uh Luce…? (1) ༻**

The strategy for the sub-event 「Territorial Fight」 was more simple
than one might expect.

All one needed to do was hit Verga’s left rib. That was his weak point.

A while ago, he was critically struck at that exact spot when he fought
against Erica Hellraud, the leader of the Four Constellation’s Black
Tiger.

Not to toot my own horn, but ever since his defeat to Erica, Verga had
been putting immense effort into his training.

Either way, I gained some valuable EXP.

‘I could partial summon with Eden as well.’

A few days ago, I reached maximum \[Synchronization\] with Eden, my
golem familiar.

Thanks to that, I was able to practice partial summoning a few times
during training, but this was the first time I had actually used it in
combat.

‘I certainly felt like the power of my punch had increased.’

Partial summoning allowed me to emulate my familiar’s abilities, thus
expanding my tactical options.

The utility of it was a matter of personal preference, but I remembered
it being quite versatile in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

The biggest advantage was that it consumed only half the mana compared
to fully summoning the familiar.

“I want to master partial summoning with Hilde by the end of the second
semester.”

The mana consumption of summoning Hilde was quite burdensome.

If I could use partial summoning, I could use Hilde’s power much more
efficiently.

With that thought in mind, I arrived at the Magic Department’s
classrooms after my morning walk.

While stepping through the hallway, I released mana through a magic tool
resembling a handgrip.

“I heard Verga Rayphelt was absolutely demolished!”

I suddenly heard the excited voices of my seniors.

“I heard he was beaten by a freshman. A Class C student at that.”

“I saw it yesterday! The freshman had rock magic covering his arm, and
he knocked Verga out with a single punch!”

“It wasn’t a normal duel. If they just fought, wouldn’t it be obvious
that Verga would win?”

“You idiot, were you not listening? It was said that a student from the
Magic Department defeated Verga with his fists! Does that even sound
possible to you?”

I could understand their exaggerated reactions.

Among the elite members of the Four Constellations, Verga was well-known
for his strength.

The fact that the Knight Department’s Verga Rayphelt lost to me, a Class
C student from the Magic Department, was shocking and sparked gossip
among the students.

Well, it would die down soon enough. At least, that was how it was like
in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

As I entered the Class C classroom, I felt the students’ curious gazes.
The reason was probably related to the gossip I had overheard on my way
here.

I took a seat right in the middle as I usually did.

“Look at him, strutting around as if he accomplished something.”

Brown short hair and a red rose hairpin.

Rose Red Rivera, a fellow Class C student, glanced at me along with a
group of male students simping for her.

She spoke with a slightly amused tone as if intentionally letting me
hear. She was probably trying to discredit my duel with Verga.

She must have really hated me to grasp at straws like this. I couldn’t
help but admire her persistent determination to consistently put me
down.

Still, she didn’t confront me directly, which probably meant that all
the times I had destroyed her made her take more of a passive attitude
in front of me.

‘It’s a bit hard to react to her even if I wanted to…’

It honestly would’ve been better if she dissed me to my face because it
would’ve been less childish than this.

Even so, I now looked forward to the question of, ‘What kind of insults
will she come up with today?’ I couldn’t believe I got this point. ***It
seems like every day, we stray further from God.***

“Senior Verga simply received that man’s full-power attack, face-on
without any trickery. Isn’t it too much to act all high and mighty after
winning like that? What an embarrasement.”

Surprisingly, I was my usual self today.

However, because of Rose’s low self-esteem, it seemed like I had become
cocky in her point of view.

“If it was just a regular duel, that guy would have been crushed like a
bug. Senior Verga is not an opponent he could ever beat fairly. Clearl-“

“Isaac.”

At that moment, a graceful girl with rose-gold hair walked into Class C.

She brushed past Rose and headed towards me.

Rose’s two eyes started shaking, as the girl’s elegant presence caused
the chattering voices of the students to quickly subside.

Anyone would be captivated to the point of awe by her beauty.

She had a bright smile on her face as she called my name. Her charming
voice sounded like scattered moonlight.

“Hey. Good weather today, right?”

She greeted me with her usual dull greeting.

It was a Class A student, Luce Eltania.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 154

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Delighted to see you.\]

As Luce casually took a seat next to me, Rose froze up like an ice
statue.

“Luce? Is your training at the Magic Tower finished?”

I already knew the answer, but I asked out of courtesy.

Luce serenely nodded.

“You worked hard. But why are you here all of a sudden?”

“Because I missed you.”

As always, Luce dismissed any emotional, social, and psychological
barriers with her dramatic manner of speaking.

The students flinched in surprise. To others, our conversation might
have sounded like that of lovers, and it was understandable to be
startled when hearing it.

The rumors about the special relationship between the top seat and me
were pretty blatantly talked about in public amongst the freshmen of the
Magic Department. As such, it wasn’t anything new for me either.

Of course, we should avoid becoming the center of attention regardless
of such rumors.

After Luce already saw that our every action was too noticeable, she
stopped caring entirely.

“I was busy these days, remember?”

After the joint practical evaluation, Luce was stuck at Hegel Magic
Tower because of her short-term probation.

A few days ago, I saw her figure from afar, wearing round glasses and a
Hegel Magic Tower robe.

Even while walking, I saw her studying the papers in her hands. Seeing
this, I realized how much work ethic and passion someone needed to
become a Tower Master.

“Lady Luce has come to Class C…!”

“How could a person be so beautiful…?”

“What’s so good about that bastard that Lady Luce…!”

Their gazes stung.

The way Class C kept their distance from Luce Eltania was similar to how
humans from the earth worship a goddess from heaven.

She was not only the top seat of the Magic Department but also
incredibly beautiful, making her presence unmistakable and constantly
profound.

Rose’s mocking voice and contempt had completely died down. She seemed
like a loser in front of the majesty of the top student.

As the whispers of the students grew louder, Luce lowered her upper
body, covered her mouth with her hand, and whispered into my ear.

“It’s okay that I came, right?”

“Heuk.”

“Yes…?”

***Fuck. Her voice.***

I couldn’t help but let out a pant as goosebumps rose all over my body.

I was taken aback so I hurriedly turned my head, covering my ears. The
sensation was too intense.

Luce tilted her head like a squirrel, her expression sly.

Unless one recorded their own voice, they could never know what it
actually sounded like. It seemed that this girl was the same as she
didn’t know how much power her voice truly held.

“Try not to whisper straight into my ears.”

“Isaac, your face got red. Is that your erogenous zone?”

Luce seemed to be having fun as she smiled mischievously. She had a
playful tone.

‘Erogenous zone…’

Isn’t her choice of words way too embarrassing?

“Did you have breakfast?”

Luce changed the subject with another mundane question, her voice gentle
and full of smiles.

“Yeah, I did.”

“What did you ea-?”

“Let’s go outside and talk.”

I was so burdened with the weight of the students’ stares that I
couldn’t stay there any longer.

We still had some time before morning classes. I got up from my seat and
continued to channel mana through the magic tool resembling a handgrip.

Luce and I left the classroom together, with the students’ envious and
resentful glares following us.

We entered the empty rest area and stood side by side in front of the
window.

The cheerful sunlight streaming through the window added to the radiance
of Luce’s smile. It was evident that she was beyond delighted to see me.

As I saw this, I couldn’t help but smile goofily, like a father who was
a fool for his daughter.

“Is your probation completely over?”

“Not yet. It’s only a short probation, so I helped a bit with some
research and came right away. I think it’ll continue until after the
end-of-term evaluation.”

Luce replied calmly, with a mixture of whispers and laughter in her
clear voice.

The research she mentioned was one that the Magic Tower had been banging
its head against the wall for over ten years, looking for clues until
Luce took the lead. I had heard about it, as it was a story from ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

Soon enough, her contributions would spread like wildfire among the
Magic Towers.

Luce was already a standout figure, being the top seat of the Magic
Department among the freshmen. Countless scout requests were sure to
flood in even before she even reached her third year.

Afterward, we chatted for a while. Luce must have also eavesdropped on
some gossip as she brought up the topic of Verga.

However, it seemed that she didn’t know who Verga was, and she didn’t
seem that interested either. Even if I had defeated such a person, it
wouldn’t have meant much to her either way.

“Isaac, you’ve been training without rest.”

Luce’s gaze was fixed on the magic tool I held in my hand while we were
chatting.

Even while talking to her, I didn’t stop channeling mana through the
magic tool.

“I’m always training. The grind never stops. Also, this is quite
helpful.”

“…Do you want me to help?”

***Huh?***

“How?”

Suddenly, Luce gently wrapped her hand around mine, which was holding
the magic tool.

I could feel the smooth texture and warmth of her hand.

***Why’s she like this?***

Right when I was about to ask why she was holding my hand…

“Eh?”

As Luce’s mana flowed in, it became incomparably harder for me to put
mana into the magic tool.

This device was a magic tool that helped train my mana mastery. It had a
similar function to putting strength into a handgrip where you squeeze
it to improve the muscles in your forearm.

It felt like widening a narrow passage forcefully with mana, struggling
to break free.

‘Wow, ugh fuck, it became so difficu-’

***…I can’t believe I’m getting excited because the training got
harder…***

***Is this how a gym rat feels when they work out? Have I gotten
addicted to training my magic?***

I must be one crazy motherfucker.

“Isaac, does this help?”

‘AHHHHH…!’

I was internally screaming, so I couldn’t immediately respond.

Luce’s mana that she casually sent in was way too powerful…

“Isaac, your face is red again. Is this also your erogenous zone?”

“I’m like this because I feel like I’m getting ran through… Wow, the
sensation is getting stronger. This is insane.”

“How is it?”

“It helps. A lot.”

“Then, let’s do this every time you use this magic tool, Isaac.”

***Huh?***

‘Wait a moment.’

***This situation… From an outside perspective, doesn’t it look too much
like a couple holding hands in a quiet place?***

I mean, I welcomed anything that helps with training, but wasn’t this a
bit too romantic…?

“…Are we going to stay like this all day today?”

“My hands are sweaty.”

“Hehe.”

Thinking it was a joke, I answered roughly, but Luce actually responded
with a bashful smile.

“Isaac, do you know?”

“What?”

“Surprisingly, I still have one more hand. I have two of them.*”*

It was truly a surprising fact. Wow. I was beyond astonished. ***TWO
HANDS? That’s crazy!***

“Do you want to hold it?”

She briefly showed her remaining hand and playfully wiggled her fingers.

Her smile was more mischievous than usual. It seemed like she was
excited to see me after a long time.

Luce wasn’t even sure if she liked me or not.

Also, she was the one to teach me not to hold hands easily with someone
unless they like each other…

When I gave her a skeptical look, Luce said, “Just kidding,” and
withdrew her remaining hand.

As we spent time like that, Luce closed her mouth and stared at me
intently.

Then, she leaned her head against the window and a faint smile adorned
her lips.

Her lips moved slightly in a whisper.

“Isaac, I missed you.”

…When I silently looked at her, she looked just like a girl in love.

As if she doesn’t want to take her gaze away from me for even a moment,
her oceanic eyes remain fixed on me.

I understood why.

Luce, who had lived alone while enduring loneliness all this time…

With my existence, she might have found a sense of social fulfillment by
being with me.

“Is that so.”

***Of course, I missed you too. Do you even know how much I care for
you…***

“Isaac, I’ll help you with training today so let’s stay together.”

“That’s what I’d like to request, actually. I’d be grateful if you would
do that for me.”

***Of course, it’s fucking welcome. It’s so welcome that I am about to
throw a celebration to welcome you.***

Having Luce’s help would be a big help in getting used to the feel of
real combat after all.

“So, we’ll be together all day?”

“Yes, as long as you help with training.”

Since I planned to train late into the night anyway, it was a welcomed
development.

Luce smiled brightly as if she were pleased.

\* \* \*

“Woah.”

As she passed through the open door of the rest area, she let out a gasp
when she saw the couple inside, holding hands and whispering sweet words
to one another.

For Ciel Carnedas, the petite girl with short blue hair, it was a
shocking sight.

They were Isaac and Luce Eltania, the top seat.

Isaac’s relationships with other girls were something very enjoyable for
her to watch. Ciel hugged the pillow in her arms even tighter as she
watched.

What else could it mean when a boy and a girl held hands and gazed at
each other in an empty rest area?

‘Those two… are already at the stage of dating, huh?’

Kaya Astrean. The brilliant genius, Senior Dorothy Heartnova.

***Does this mean that the top seat had surpassed all her competitors
and had seemingly won the battle for Isaac…?***

‘…No, it’s not over yet.’

Ciel suddenly remembered that until just yesterday, she would
occasionally see Kaya in the Class A lecture room, lost in thought and
looking distressed, as if she was going insane at the mere thought of
Isaac.

Yes. That was right. The battle wasn’t over yet. After all, Isaac was a
guy famous for being an elusive target for the girls.

It didn’t matter if they were just holding hands; it didn’t necessarily
mean they were in a relationship.

However, the top seat’s approach was quite bold.

The gentle moonlight-like smile she showed only to Isaac was different
from her usual demeanor.

She usually seemed so uninterested in other people’s feelings. Could it
be that Isaac was an exception?

Class A Lecture Room.

Ciel approached Kaya, who was quietly preparing for morning class.

Lisetta Lionheart and Keridna Whiteclark, who were also in Class A,
looked at Ciel with puzzled eyes.

They had never seen Ciel, who always seemed uninterested in the world,
approach someone like this before.

“Yes? Ms. Ciel?”

Kaya looked towards Ciel with her jade eyes.

“Um? What are you doing right now?”

“Huh? Just preparing for class…”

How could this be? Ciel slapped her forehead in disbelief. Her
competitors were already on the prowl since early in the morning!

This was a fierce battle being waged among the three women over Isaac.
Ciel knew that someone like her had no room to meddle. After all,
useless intervention would only cause trouble.

But even so, there was one thing she had to say.

“Get your act together.”

“…Huh?”

“If you keep acting like this, someone will snatch him away from you.”

Phew, that was all she could do for now. She felt relieved after letting
those words out.

After saying that, Ciel went to her seat at the back of the classroom.

And as she sat down, she glared at Kaya, who was at a loss for words.
Kaya didn’t know what it meant, but there was a strong determination in
Ciel’s eyes to keep a close watch until Kaya improved herself.

“…?”

Kaya was just bewildered beyond belief.

<span id="0102_104_-_Uh_Hey_Uh_Luce_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 104: - Uh Hey, Uh Luce...? (2)
======================================

**༺ Uh Hey, Uh Luce…? (2) ༻**

The position of an elite member among the Four Constellations could only
be occupied by the best of the best.

Therefore, it was obvious that the skill of Verga Rayphelt, an elite
member of the Black Tiger Constellation, was held in high regard.

It was rare to find anyone who didn’t know of his capability. As such,
his defeat had spread raging wildfire.

“Keheuheuheu…”

Black Tiger Headquarters. In an opulent lounge, the refined laughter of
a female student echoed.

Even the male student, who was comfortably seated in a spacious chair,
couldn’t help but let out a chuckle.

The cause of this laughter was none other than the entrance of Verga
Rayphelt, in all his dark green hair and muscled glory.

“Don’t laugh.”

Even Verga’s low, growling voice couldn’t suppress the laughter of the
two students.

“Are you kidding me? How could an elite member of the Constellations get
destroyed by a Magic Department freshman? And a kid from Class C at
that? To even make such a ridiculous rule… Was dueling always so boring
for you?”

“Next time, there won’t be any problems. If I have a proper match, I’ll
definitely wi-!”

“Wow! You’re such a sore loser! Uahaha!”

As Verga raised his fist, the male student stopped laughing.

“I always knew something like this would happen.”

While leaning against the window, a second-year student from the Knight
Department spoke up as he casually curled a dumbbell that any normal
person would find absurdly heavy. His toned bicep elongated and then
shortened in a rhythmic pattern.

“Take it easy, Verga. You’re seriously addicted to duels.”

“Hmph! That’s nonsense. Prove whether your words are right or wrong with
your strength. Let us duel right now!”

The male student by the window didn’t stop curling the dumbbell as he
let out a deep sigh.

After all, Verga was uncompromising and had a severe duel addiction. He
didn’t expect much from his response in the first place.

“Hey, Senior. What are you going to do then, huh? Are you going to throw
away your own rules and ask, ‘Oh why don’t we have a proper duel this
time?’ Is that what you call a proposal? Moreover, an elite member of
Black Tiger would challenge some Magic Department Class C freshman kid?
Isn’t that quite ridiculous?”

The female student sitting on the couch criticized Verga with a teasing
tone.

“It tarnishes the honor of Black Tiger\~.”

“How arrogant. Do you want a scolding, Janie?”

“Heheh.”

Janie, who had been sipping her tea, defused the situation with her
usual aegyo; a tactic she had developed whenever she had nothing more to
say.

“…Nevertheless, she does make good points. Of course, your manners to a
senior are a complete and utter mess though.”

Verga stared at his clenched fist.

“However, if I ever get a chance to fight that guy again, at that time…
I’ll make sure he feels the difference in our strengths.”

Due to the shock he received in the duel last night, his abdominal
muscles still ached.

He had let his guard down. After all, the amount of mana he felt from
that Magic Department junior was so minuscule that he didn’t think he
had anything to be worried about.

However, he could have never imagined that the bastard would hold that
much physical power.

Didn’t they call a wizard with immense physical strength a ‘Martial
Mage’? That guy must have been one of those individuals.

If he ever had the chance to fight Isaac again, he would not let his
guard down like he did yesterday.

He would definitely repay this humiliation.

“Are you planning to humiliate Black Tiger again?”

“Janie…”

“Heheh.”

“…”

\*\*\*

It was a season that brought a cold breeze and the sky gradually
darkened earlier than usual.

In a corner of the butterfly garden, Isaac and Luce stood facing each
other, setting quite a distance between them for their duel.

Isaac didn’t want other people to know about this training spot, so the
two chose to come here in secret.

“Luce.”

Isaac had a composed expression as he pressed his knees firmly to
stretch. Zhonya’s Staff was on the ground beside him.

“I’m going to be in your care for the entire day. I’m going to train
seriously. It can’t be compared to last time. Are you sure you’re okay
with that?”

“Yeah, it’s okay.”

She didn’t voice it, but Luce was thinking, ‘I actually prefer it that
way’.

“Thanks. I’ll make it up to you later.”

“There’s no need. It’s really okay.”

While tilting her head, Luce smiled brightly. As always, her genuine
smile was reserved exclusively for Isaac.

The difference in the amount of mana between Isaac and Luce was like
comparing a deep sea to a shallow pool.

Basically, Luce was wasting her time whenever she indulged Isaac.

But of course, Luce always wanted to be with Isaac.

And, as always, Isaac knew what she was truly thinking thanks to
\[Psychological Insight\].

However, that didn’t mean he intended to take advantage of her feelings.
After all, she was someone he truly cared for.

As such, if Luce was willing to assist him in his training, he was
certainly planning to repay her accordingly.

After finishing his stretches, Isaac picked up Zhonya’s Staff.

He twirled it lightly, as if it were a spear or a rod, and proceeded to
ready himself for combat.

A comfortable grip. Smooth mana flow. His previous training with the
staff had been a significant help in enhancing his mana mastery.

His crimson eyes solely focused on Luce. A strong determination was
clearly visible on his face, almost as if to say, ‘Today, I will
definitely land a blow on Luce’.

“Do you think you can land a blow on me today?”

“No matter what, I will.”

Due to the countless attacks he had poured at her during their previous
duels, Luce knew about Isaac’s tenacious dedication better than anyone
else.

Today, Isaac was planning to relentlessly attack until he collapsed from
exhaustion.

And right at that moment, Isaac rushed in.

*Fuaaah—!*

*Zzzeuk–! Kwang!*

It was a futile endeavor to try to freeze Luce’s water magic with his
ice magic.

If he summoned the small golem familiar, Eden, and combined their powers
to use rock magic, the torrent would instantly destroy it.

The high-density mana forming the water magic created an intense
current. Isaac’s magic was nowhere near enough to resist it.

And even if he tried to use his athleticism to dodge it, he was still
swept away by the insane AoE of her attacks.

Even so, the fiery determination in his eyes never faded in the
slightest.

He had always been like this. In order to reach Luce, he would grit his
teeth and charge like his life depended on it.

However, it wasn’t rash stubbornness that fueled him. He had always used
Luce as an experiment to try unique approaches, and if those didn’t
work, he would even try new methods.

His ability to apply the knowledge he gained in class directly to his
battle tactics was no longer surprising.

To onlookers, this duel could appear futile and meaningless.

However, to Luce, who had clashed with Isaac, she could keenly feel his
steady growth with every duel that they had.

‘His mana amount, mana mastery, elemental resistance, and his reflexes
have all noticeably improved.’

When compared to the first semester, his growth was almost terrifying.

‘You’re incredible, Isaac…’

Involuntarily, she found herself uttering words of amazement in her
head. And not too long after, a smile curled up her lips.

For Luce, witnessing Isaac’s growth in person was a source of immense
pride.

\* \* \*

The vast night sky stretched across the field.

While gasping for breath, I laid on the grass. I was so soaked that I
resembled a drowned rat.

‘I’m so tired I’m about to die…’

After hours of sparring with Luce, I was completely exhausted.

My body refused to move; my stamina was completely drained.

‘Well, it was obvious it would turn out this way…’

While training with Luce greatly improved my combat senses and
abilities, it had a fatal flaw; I got rapidly fatigued and it even
affected my condition for the next day.

However, there was not much time left until the Floating Island part.

Now was the time to focus on rapidly improving my combat abilities, even
if it meant clenching my teeth and enduring the necessary hardships.

That was why I boldly charged at Luce, but as expected, I ended up in
this sorry state.

It was impossible to land even a single effective hit on her.

And this was considering the fact that she probably only used a fraction
of her full power…

***…Oh well. For now, I should just focus on improving my stats.***

“Isaac, are you okay?”

Luce, who had suddenly appeared before me, looked down and bent her
upper body forward.

Even the simple action of pushing back her flowing rose-gold hair exuded
an elegant and noble grace.

“If I’m being completely honest, I can’t move at all. I think I’m
dying…”

“Mmm.”

I was expecting her to extend her hand while asking, ‘Do you want to get
up?’ but…

“Isaac looks defenseless right now. Can I kidnap him like this?”

***An unexpectedly fucked up question popped up.***

“…Seriously?”

“Just kidding.”

Luce laughed faintly.

***Is this a horror movie? Don’t say such things while you’re blushing,
okay? It freaks me out.***

Shortly after, Luce unfolded a fire magic scroll and placed it next to
me. Flames akin to a bonfire emerged and provided just the right amount
of warmth.

It seemed like she had predicted that I would be soaked by her water
magic, so she prepared it in advance.

Afterward, Luce sat down with her butt placed on my abdomen.

As if it was always meant to turn out like this, her actions were so
natural that even I was nearly fooled.

With that, she placed her hand on my chest and began casting a simple
healing spell; my pain gradually subsided.

“…I’m grateful and all, but I’m not a chair.”

“Isaac, I have something I want to ask you.”

***Huh, she’s utterly ignoring me.***

As time passed, it seemed that Luce had developed a sense of how much
teasing was acceptable.

According to ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Luce originally had a
mischievous personality. The evidence of this could be shown in the
increasing frequency of her jokes and pranks.

It was good to see her gradually become brighter and happier.

Anyway, I focused on what Luce was trying to ask.

“Why are you trying so hard, Isaac? It was already pretty bad, but
today, it seems even worse than usual.”

Luce’s ability to read people was at an inhuman level. If I pushed
myself even a little, she would immediately notice.

Although it didn’t seem like a question one should ask while sitting on
me, I decided to give a brief and simple answer.

“This is the only way I can become more skilled. I have to be strong
like you in order to swagger around, you know?”

Half of my reply was a truth, regarding how I wanted to improve quickly,
and the other half was a lie, regarding how I wanted to act cool.
Hearing that, Luce briefly bursted into laughter.

Even the sound of her laugh was elegant. It was astonishing how a voice
could be so refined.

“You want to be like me?”

“You’re the top seat after all.”

“That’s true. With your high ambition, it’s only natural.”

After stretching both of her legs out, Luce grasped my thigh and chest
while looking up at the night sky.

Her expression was clearly in deep contemplation.

“I guess it can’t be helped then. I can’t say anything even if you
overdo it.”

Since I didn’t really have anything to say, I didn’t reply.

Then, right as Luce’s healing magic finished…

She climbed off my body and laid down right beside me.

“Huh?”

With that, Luce suddenly pulled my head into her chest.

“…!”

An indescribable softness spread around my head.

And a pleasant fragrance gently wafted into my nose.

Although no words of interjection came out, my two eyes were already
spinning in shock.

It was incredibly… bewildering.

***“Uh hey, uh Luce…?”***

“Even so, it’s okay to lean and depend on me sometimes.”

Luce’s gentle voice came close, softly enveloping my ears.

It was an enthralling voice that seemed to tickle my eardrums like a
feather.

“Feel free to push yourself as much as you want, but if it gets too
tough, come to me. That’s okay with you, right?”

I widened my eyes and looked at Luce.

Thanks to the fire magic scroll beside us, her youthful smile shone
brightly in my eyes.

Come to think of it, Luce had always shown a great deal of concern over
my well-being.

She always seemed like someone who couldn’t stand seeing me in danger
and wanted to protect me at all costs.

I understood that right now… I was the most precious existence to Luce.

Her sensitivity to my well-being was probably due to her trauma of
losing precious people in the past.

When something bad happened to me, she would get angry, sad, or would
even cry for me. Luce was just that kind of person.

‘I’m so proud of her.’

***Hoo, this is making me feel like a proud dad.***

“So this is not embarrassing for you?”

Last time when she asked, ‘Do you want to touch my breasts?’, she
immediately withdrew her words in embarrassment. But it seemed like a
hug was within her acceptable range.

“Eut, Isaac… your breath tickles a little.”

Her laughter-tinted voice echoed mysteriously. How embarrassing…

Enough. I needed to get up before I got even more embarrassed.

It seemed like the healing magic Luce had casted on me had already
spread throughout my whole body, so I recovered a decent amount of
strength. Based on my experience, I should be able to resume training in
a few minutes.

“Isaac?”

I pushed myself away from Luce and lifted up my torso.

I couldn’t remain drunk on such ecstasy when my stamina was already
returning.

Luce also followed suit, as she lifted herself up.

“Can I really count on you for things like this?”

When I playfully asked, Luce tilted her head slightly with a sly smile.

“The limit is hugs.”

“…I wasn’t thinking of asking for more.”

“Liar.”

I decided not to argue any further.

With Luce’s extraordinary memory and keen observation, she was likely
aware of the exact amount of times I had glanced at her chest. There was
no credibility in my denials.

It was best to move on from such topics.

“…Why aren’t you denying it more?”

As an awkward silence hung in the air, Luce slightly avoided my gaze.
Both of her cheeks had a subtle hint of redness.

***You weren’t gonna believe me anyway…***

The flames conjured by the fire magic scroll crackled like a bonfire.

Although it was just an area for training, lighting a fire with a magic
scroll seemed to change the entire atmosphere, almost as if it was an
actual campsite.

I chatted briefly with Luce for a while, and when my body was fully
recovered, I jumped up from my spot.

“Let’s start again.”

As she fumbled around, Luce said, “Okay.” while taking my wrist and
getting up as well.

That day, Luce helped me in my training until dawn.

\* \* \*

West, towards Arkins Sea.

As she listened to the waves crashing against the cliffs; she stared
into the endlessly dark sea. She couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of
futility.

While firmly pressing down on her witch hat to prevent it from flying
away in the sea breeze…

…Dorothy Heartnova sat at the edge of the cliff, gazing at the distant
horizon.

Underneath the hat that covered the moonlight, there was not a hint of
her usual smile on her dry and wheathered face.

It was because she had started to faintly sense an oddly familiar mana
in the sea breeze.

At first, she thought there might be something in the ordinary sky, but
upon closer inspection, there was nothing there.

Nevertheless, a foreboding feeling gnawed at her.

She couldn’t shake the feeling that, above that sea, there was an
impending calamity possessing terrifying mana, that even she could not
stop.

She would die from a curse.

Before she did, there was a being that she needed to send to the
afterlife.

She didn’t even know that the very being she needed to send into the
afterlife was about to appear.

Dorothy was someone who had formed a contract with Stella, the Fairy of
Stars, allowing her to observe all worlds where starlight shone.

However, due to her lacking abilities, she couldn’t see everything and
what she could see was rather unclear…

But thanks to this metaphysical and transcendental ability, Dorothy knew
how powerful the colossal entity that cursed her was.

It was almost as if the architect of this world made it an existence
that shouldn’t be defeated.

Therefore, Dorothy had no choice but to calmly accept death.

***─‘I will save Senior.’***

As she observed another world, memories emerged from her other self and
began to resonate with her own.

It was the declaration made by a boy with silver-blue hair on this very
cliff.

In the fog of memories, his words were the only echoes that were clearly
etched in her mind. Her heart fluttered and her lips twitched
involuntarily.

Dorothy silently held her breath as she watched the raging waves.

Not long after…

As if boasting its dominating presence, a massive island appeared in the
sky over the Arkins Sea.

Its size, which seemed to cover the entire sea, was nothing short of its
own little world.

Chapter 105: - Subjugation of the Floating Island (1)
=====================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (1) ༻**

The first snow had arrived.

The late afternoon’s hazy sky was sprinkled with dainty snowflakes.

Märchen Academy proudly displayed its white beauty, all covered in snow
and frost.

As the end-of-semester evaluation for the second semester approached,
most students, while focusing on their studies and training, couldn’t
help but get briefly lost in the beauty of the first snowfall.

Luce Eltania listened to the lectures with a cold expression, but would
smile broadly as she sought out Isaac during break; she played pranks,
studied with him, and even helped him with magic training.

In Isaac’s company, she exhibited such liveliness that her nickname as
the Ice Princess seemed ill-fitting.

It was said that love had the power to change a person.

And at a glance, there was no doubt that she had an unwavering desire
for Issac and no one else.

Meanwhile, Kaya Astrea was determined to surpass Luce in this semester’s
end-of-semester evaluation.

However, even while doing so, she couldn’t help but secretly fret over
Luce and Isaac constantly being together.

In the midst of it all, Dark Kaya got so frustrated that she would take
over, occasionally cuddling Isaac from behind in an attempt to seduce
him or feed him snacks.

Of course, Ciel Carnedas didn’t care whether there was an
end-of-semester evaluation or not, as she decided to just sleep and see
where life took her.

Lisetta Lionheart’s tough nature remained, but there were unbelievable
rumors circulating among the Magic Department freshmen that she had
become more humble.

Surprisingly, it was true.

She had let go of her preconceived notion that she was strong and had
resolved to refine herself to become a true powerhouse. She tirelessly
trained with Rock Bat, her magic weapon, while honing her skills to
their very limits.

Tristan Humphrey was determined to prove his superiority in this
end-of-semester evaluation as well. He pushed himself beyond what he
would normally do and shed blood, sweat, and tears as a result.

He felt a subtle sense of urgency, as he did not want to be outpaced by
the rapidly growing commoner, Isaac. Witnessing Isaac defeat Verga was
shocking to him. Even Tristan, in his own way, was feeling a bit
impatient and unsatisfied with his current level of skill.

Mateo Jordana studied in the library and trained his magic alongside the
protagonist of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Ian Fairytale, and his rumored
lover, Amy Holloway.

Despite being a commoner, he was determined to prove that he could
exhibit skills comparable to nobles.

All of them wore the same uniform and lived in the same confined space
of the academy.

They each harbored their own circumstances and diligently walked their
own paths.

As such, time at Märchen Academy continued to flow.

\[──────────.\]

Suddenly, like a flying stone shattering a glass window, it appeared.

Evening, above the Arkins Sea.

As if to announce its very presence, an eerie wailing, akin to a
woodwind instrument, echoed widely throughout the Zelver Empire.

As the sound waves shook the outer walls of the buildings, students
looked towards the west with surprised expressions.

Despite being incredibly far away, it covered the sea; it was so large
that it couldn’t be fully captured in their vision.

While enveloped in a huge advection fog, a massive island floated
silently in the sky without any movement.

The grand scale left the students in awe with their mouths agape.

“What… is that?”

“Isn’t it dangerous?”

“How did something like that just pop up?”

“Wasn’t there nothing there just a moment ago?

“No way… Could it be… the Floating Island?”

The eerie and alien enigma that the island emanated aroused primal fear
in humans.

A formidable mana, akin to physical force, surged like a raging tide.

Zelver Empire’s Number 1 Target for Punitive Expeditions: The Floating
Island.

Historical records stated that whenever that island appeared out of
nowhere, the surrounding areas turned into a wasteland.

A brave knight, who had reached the island and barely managed to
survive, had recorded it as both paradise and hell.

The Floating Island, only seen in books, had suddenly appeared before
the students.

It was an unbelievable sight for anyone.

\* \* \*

The Floating Island, Cavallion the Earthshaker

During the first year of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it revealed itself
above the Arkins Sea on the day of the first snowfall.

I had already arrived on the coastline near the Arkins Sea.

A demon landmass of grand scale floated in the sky above the sea,
shrouded in dense advection fog.

Finally, the long-awaited last demon of the first year second semester
had appeared before my very eyes.

\[Cavallion the Earthshaker\] **Lv:** 190

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Earth

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:** \[────────.\]

‘Are you fucking kidding me? It’s fuckin’ huge…’

As expected, there was a stark difference between seeing it in a game
and seeing it in reality.

Seriously… it was fucking massive. Even Hilde would be the size of a
ladybug compared to this demon.

Moreover, due to the thick fog, it looked extraordinarily mystical; it
was to the point that it seemed like an illusion.

If I recall correctly, the academy staff should be in a state of
emergency by now.

Hegel Magic Tower’s Tower Master, Aria, would have detected the eerie
and aggressive mana and relayed the danger through communication magic
to Headmistress Elena.

Receiving this, Headmistress Elena would have ordered the academy’s
staff and the Student Council to evacuate the students and had likely
requested the Imperial Knights’ cooperation.

Additionally, academy researchers and Hegel Magic Tower would be working
together to quickly analyze the structure of the Floating Island in
order to formulate countermeasures.

For reference, the scene where people become surprised when finding out
that the Floating Island was not a mere physical island, but a demon,
would be revealed approximately two hours from now.

*Woooooooong───.*

Soon, large-scale magic circles were etched all over the body of the
Floating Island. It was getting ready for combat.

Earth magic circles. They were a deeper shade of crimson than rock magic
circles.

The rock element was nothing more than a derivation of the earth
element. As such, the earth element could be considered the true
fundamental element.

‘Anyway, since it’s pretty similar to the rock element…’

I recalled that about 70 percent of the earth element’s calculated
damage was counted as the rock element.

I had set the Elemental Bracelet on my left wrist to the rock element.
As such, my \[Rock Elemental Resistance\] was increased by 40.

Due to the colossal size of the Floating Island, even the grand scale of
each magic circle appeared relatively small.

However, the vast black and brown magic circle slowly being drawn
beneath the Floating Island was incomparable in its scale.

As it was a magic circle constructed with astronomical amounts of mana,
the process of engraving its form into the air was painstakingly slow.

According to the calculations of Hegel Magic Tower’s Tower Master, Aria,
that magic circle would assume its complete form approximately four
hours from the current time; this information would have already been
widespread within the academy’s staff.

If that vast magic circle was to unleash an attack towards Arkins Sea…

A portion of the Arkins Sea would utterly evaporate and at least a tenth
of the vast Zelver Empire’s territory would undoubtedly be eviscerated.

And, of course, the island where Märchen Academy was located would be
easily obliterated.

This was the content of the Bad Ending.

“S-Sir Isaac… Is that really… a… demon…? That entire island?”

On the sandy beach.

Beside me, a girl with light green hair, Kaya Astrea, asked in a
trembling voice. Her eyes were emerald-colored; it was the original
Kaya.

I had given her the same black hooded robe as me, which inhibited
recognition from others.

I had given her information about the Floating Island’s appearance in
advance to ask for her help. After all, with her, I could secretly and
quickly fly to the Floating Island.

As expected, Kaya had fervently accepted saying, ‘If it’s to protect the
peace of the academy!’, and had helped me get all the way here.

However, now that she was actually seeing the enemy with her own eyes,
her emotions took a new turn. Both of her hands were trembling as she
tightly held on to the Armana Wand.

Despite her fierce determination, it seemed like its colossal size and
terrifying mana had completely overwhelmed her.

“We… have to defeat that thing, right? We… Ah, Sir Isaac?”

I kept my gaze fixed on the Floating Island while gently stroking Kaya’s
head in an effort to soothe her.

“It’ll be okay. If it feels dangerous, just stick close to me.”

***…Why do I feel scorching heat on my hand? Also, why is there smoke
coming out of her head?***

Without me noticing, Kaya’s face had suddenly turned bright red. Her
body had stiffened and she couldn’t even move.

“Huaaaaah…”

A strange sound came from Kaya’s mouth, almost as if she was a deflating
balloon.

Anyway, she didn’t look scared anymore.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes…”

Kaya lowered her gaze and her flushed cheeks were slightly covered with
a strand of hair akin to a tail.

She nodded her head slightly and responded with a shy voice.

Just like how Leafa the Illusive had the unique magic \[Penetrative
Vision\], the Floating Island Cavallion the Earthshaker had the ability
to teleport as its own unique magic. It was commonly referred to as
Warp.

In the world of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, teleportation magic was
incredibly rare.

‘There’s nothing more to say; even Dorothy and the Council of Kings
can’t use it.’

Once the Floating Island teleported its huge body, it couldn’t use it
again for at least a day.

For reference, the Empire couldn’t find it anywhere in this world
because it had always hidden itself deep beneath the sea.

Usually, the Floating Island would warp Dorothy Heartnova, the person it
cursed, and Ian Fairytale, the light element user it needed to kill, to
itself. Because it was a unique magic that designated its target, it
couldn’t be stopped.

Dorothy would be absorbed into its core at the center of its body and
her curse would rapidly progress, thus rendering her incapable of
controlling her own body. Basically, she would become completely
helpless.

On the other hand, Ian would only be warped to someplace on the Floating
Island.

Afterward, due to its constraints, the Floating Island would not be able
to use warp magic until the end of Act 6 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

‘Therefore, the first thing I need to do is…’

***Support Ian.***

Until the subjugation team from Märchen Academy arrived and joined Ian,
I needed to protect him.

As expected of the protagonist, Ian was born with the temperament of a
Hero. He would quickly assess the situation and determine that he needed
to stop the Floating Island.

Then, he would defeat the Floating Island’s minions and head towards the
center of the island.

Ian must unleash \[Apostle of Light\] onto the core of the Floating
Island.

Only then would the Floating Island’s powerful protection magic be
nullified, allowing effective damage to be dealt.

‘And that’s my cue.’

My ultimate goal was to unload firepower at the level of Dorothy’s
ultimate starlight elemental skill, \[Last Light of a Dying Star\], on
the Floating Island itself.

Therefore, since I couldn’t afford to waste mana, Kaya’s role would
become crucial in many ways.

The Floating Island was both a paradise and a hell. It boasted a
beautiful exterior and sparkling flames but was also filled with white
mushrooms that sprayed poisonous spores, as well as jewels that would
cause necrosis of the skin upon contact.

Still, Kaya’s plant elemental healing abilities were unparalleled, so
she should be able to cover me in case of an unexpected emergency.

By the way, the subjugation team would be able to find Ian easily,
thanks to the pin on his necktie. It was a present from the obsessive
Amy; it was a magic tool that functioned as a location tracker.

Kaya and I put on our hoods. It was time to depart.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whooooosh───.*

Light green wind made of highly dense mana wrapped around me and Kaya
and floated our bodies upward.

With that, we began to ride the wind while flying towards the Floating
Island.

Infiltrating the Floating Island was incredibly simple… You just had to
get there.

It didn’t stop any infiltrators at all.

This was because the corpses within its body would act as nutrients; a
characteristic of the earth element.

This was also why the subjugation team from Märchen Academy could easily
reach the Floating Island.

As such, there was no need to worry about being attacked while Kaya and
I flew towards it.

“Sir Isaac.”

As we crossed the sea and pushed through the mist, Kaya called out to
me.

She was blatantly staring at me with puppy-like eyes, but then quickly
turned her head to face forward when our eyes met.

Underneath the hood, a rosy tint was visible on Kaya’s usually porcelain
cheek.

“I’m saying that because it feels like this is an opportunity for me…
and it’s kind of my personal whim, so you don’t really have to listen to
it, and also it might be disrespectful to you, but… well… uh, it’s just
that it’s a bit scarier than I thought, an-and, of course, you don’t
have to do it, but…!”

“What is it?”

***Why are you beating around the bush so much…?***

Although Kaya turned her head to where I could only see the back of it,
she slightly lowered her gaze while subtly extending her hand towards
me…

***…With a bright red face.***

“Is it okay… to just hold hands while we go…?”

“…”

Come to think of it, she had seen me hang out with Luce a lot lately.

Whenever Luce helped me with my magic training tool, it didn’t look much
different from a couple holding hands when seen at a distance.

I could tell Kaya was pretty envious of this thanks to \[Psychological
Insight\].

I had a lot of things to be grateful for in regards to Kaya.

Even if I just considered today, if she wasn’t on my side, the
circumstances and my chances would’ve been abysmally different.

Therefore, if I refused something as easy as hand-holding, it would make
me feel like I was belittling her efforts.

‘This much should be okay.’

When I calmly grabbed the hand that Kaya extended, both of her eyes
shook and her shoulders flinched.

“Ah, Heuahhh…!”

Kaya stared at her own hand as if she couldn’t believe what she was
seeing.

Her face and hand turned bright red to the point of basically changing
her skin color. The last time she had been this way was long ago, back
when we defeated Garzia the Hermit together and camped outside.

\[Kaya Astrean\] **Psychology:** \[Absolutely thrilled to hold hands
with you.\]

“Focus. Don’t let your mana scatter.’

“Y-yes, Sir Isaac…”

She responded with a voice that was both cutesy and flirtatious, almost
as if she was a lover who just started a fresh romance.

Even under the hood, her head was practically fuming with smoke.

Her resistance towards males still seemed quite weak, but this much
progress was significant. It could be due to the influence of Dark Kaya.

As I faced forward again, the enormous island, akin to a small nation,
was now within my sight. I felt like I would get devoured just from its
overwhelmingly imposing aura.

Even so…

‘I won’t let Dorothy die.’

If, until now, I had been working towards my goal by carefully
progressing through the scenario while minimizing variables…

Today, I intended to completely overturn the entire scenario.

After all, I had grinded through this world, not only to defeat the Evil
God, but also for today.

***As always…***

***…Let’s do it.***

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

Chapter 106: - Subjugation of the Floating Island (2)
=====================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (2) ༻**

「Clairvoyance (Neutral Element, ★7)」

Thanks to my days as a ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ sweat, I could roughly
track Ian’s whereabouts. I used \[Clairvoyance\] to roughly scan the
area where I thought he would be.

A place lined with old temple columns…

In the center of it all, a black-haired boy, Ian Fairytale, stood on a
yellow brick road.

A vivid rainbow stretched above the Floating Island.

In the center of the Floating Island, a dazzling scene was proudly
displayed by an emerald-colored palace.

Above it, a statue of a sun radiated brilliantly, hovering weightlessly
while spinning around.

Ian summoned a Tyrannosaurus-like dinosaur familiar, Rex, and drew the
sword sheathed at his waist.

He held his breath, gripped the sword with both hands, and assumed a
combat stance, as a drop of cold sweat trickled down his face.

As someone with excellent senses, he would quickly realize that there
were enemies all around him.

Soon enough, various white wolves and raven-like monsters erupted from
the ground. Their eyes emitted a red light as they opened their large
mouths and revealed sharp teeth.

At the center, a white witch-like monster that wore a pointed hat sprang
out of the ground.

Her head was torn apart to form the shape of a mouth. But because it
couldn’t be completely ripped away, the flesh connecting to the upper
and lower lips stretched like cheese.

‘Minions of the Floating Island…’

They were all magical beasts created by the earth mana of the Floating
Island.

When the witch demon pointed at Ian with her staff and gave the command
to attack, the horde of wolves and raven demons charged toward him.

At the same time, Cherubim’s Necklace, which was hung around Ian’s neck,
began to radiate light.

One swing.

Ian swung the sword imbued with divine power horizontally, cutting down
all the minions of the Floating Island with a blade made of light.

‘That’s what I’m talking about!’

***Keuhhhh. How beautiful.***

***Is this really the same Ian Faintingtale from before? The Master
Fainter?***

Obtaining Cherubim’ Necklace certainly had a significant effect. After
all, the item has dramatically enhanced Ian’s combat power.

Ian’s familiar, Rex, transformed into a larger form of a Tyrannosaurus.

And with it, streams of flames elongated like wings on both sides of its
mouth.

Ian rode on Rex’s back and began to rush towards the center of the
Floating Island.

He probably noticed that the Floating Island was trying to use a spell
that was at the level of destroying an entire country. As such, he
decided to prevent it by going towards the center where the most potent
magic power could be felt: the Emerald Palace.

The mana emanating from the Floating Island belonged to a demon. Ian,
who possessed the light element, could probably feel its eerie mana and
must have judged that only he could deal a significant blow to this
demon.

“Heuh…”

“…?”

Hearing a queer sound, I release \[Clairvoyance\] and turned my head
towards the noise.

A girl with light-green pigtails was still blushing in embarrassment,
just as she was before.

She was biting her lips, almost as if she didn’t know what to do with
herself. Holding hands with me seemed to be more stimulating for her
than the formidable enemies before us.

…Well, It was understandable. The emotions that came with holding hands
with your crush for the first time were indescribable after all.

‘Still, isn’t she way too embarrassed…’

I thought about saying something but decided not to. Honestly, this was
better than being overwhelmed by the majesty of the Floating Island.

Kaya and I were still on our way to the Floating Island while riding a
light green wind over the sea.

If I looked back, the vast island where Märchen Academy was located
seemed tiny beyond the fog.

For reference, Kaya and I would not be detected from Märchen Academy
because of the dense advection fog and the massive mana of the Floating
Island.

Even in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the academy staff couldn’t stop Mateo
from flying straight to the Floating Island due to this exact reason.

Oh, by the way, they only knew he left thanks to Amy’s report

The transparent barrier deployed on the grounds of Märchen Academy was
used to detect external intrusions. However, because it was entirely
absorbing the mana of the Floating Island, it would likely be rendered
useless.

Therefore, the academy’s staff were probably overwhelmed with student
control and countermeasure preparations against the Floating Island.

*Step–.*

Kaya and I reached the edge of the Floating Island’s cliff and landed.

As I let go of her hand, Kaya sighed, “Eut, ahh…”, as if she was a kid
who had lost her favorite toy.

“Kaya, we’re here.”

My words snapped Kaya back to her senses.

She turned her head towards the front.

“Sir Isaac, this is…”

Only then, did Kaya see the magnificent view, as her jaw dropped and her
eyes widened.

A vivid rainbow, the Emerald Palace, and the sun statue floating
weightlessly whilst spinning around.

The mysterious fog reflected beautiful colors.

A yellow brick road crosses a poppy field.

At first glance, it resembled a fairy tale landscape that stimulated the
spirit of adventure. In stark contrast, right behind us was a perilous
cliff that would plunge us into a raging sea.

It felt like we were stepping on the boundary between a fairy tale and
reality.

“I thought it would be a mundane scene, but it strangely beautif-”

“Let’s go.”

“Ah! Y-yes!”

Similar to how a poisonous mushroom looked pretty, this fantastical land
was as dangerous as it was beautiful.

We were once again carried by the wind, quickly following along the
yellow brick road.

“…!”

Suddenly, white dwarf monsters with pointed hats popped out from the
yellow brick road and poppy field. Seeing this, I came to a screeching
halt, as if slamming the brakes of a car.

All the dwarves were dressed in blue robes.

\[Phantasmal Munchkin\] **Lv:** 95

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Earth

**Danger:** Medium

**Psychology:** \[Wants to eat away at your sanity.\]

\[Kekek… Welcome to the country of Munchkins…!\]

Before the bastard in the middle of the dwarf demons, A.K.A. Phantasmal
Munchkins could finish his greetings…

I sent ice mana into my right hand and released ice crystals and pale
blue mana akin to cigarette smoke.

*Chrrrrak──.*

As I prepared to fight, my unique characteristic \[Hunter\] activated.

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[Your level and stats are temporarily
greatly enhanced!\] \[Your skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]
「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Hwarereuk──────!!!*

I deployed a magic circle and waved my hand lightly, unleashing a cold
light blue flame.

The frigid flames spread widely, incinerating everything in its path,
including the Munchkin horde and the entire surrounding landscape.

The vast poppy field, which had been swaying aimlessly in the wind,
instantly froze.

And the horde of Phantasmal Munchkins, who were no longer a match for
me, were reduced to dust in a truly demonic fashion.

As I waved my arms to dissipate the cold flames, my unique
characteristic \[Hunter\] was deactivated. My body became significantly
heavier and my surging mana subsided.

The landscape before me had changed from a fantastical land to a
freezing wasteland.

“Y-you’re incredible, Sir Isaac…!”

As I casually swept away the ice crystals that had formed around me,
Kaya gazed at me, practically beaming starlight from her eyes.

***As expected, that reaction is way too burdensome…***

For reference, the amount of \[Frostfire\] I released just now was
nothing when considering my \[Hunter\] state.

In my \[Hunter\] state, my mana recovery speed was exceptionally high.
In this place, demons would continuously pop out, so the mana I spent on
\[Frostfire\] would be quickly replenished.

“But what was that just now?”

“Demons. They’re minions of this island. Don’t ever talk with them.”

“Huh…?”

If someone talked to the minions of the Floating Island, this place
would become a true fantasy world that deluded that person’s mind.

The mental attacks of demons had no effect on Ian, who had the light
element, and I had strong mental resistance, so I could somehow break
free.

However, for Kaya, it could be a serious issue.

Even if she managed to regain her senses somehow, at that point, the
curse of the Floating Island would have already taken effect.

When someone fell into the Fantasy World, the appearance and speech of
the Floating Island’s minions changed exclusively for that person.

And in order to return home, they would have to go on a heart-pounding
journey to find the great wizard Oz, who granted any wish. It was
something that Dorothy had experienced in her childhood.

Finally, when they reach the center of the floating Island and find the
great wizard Oz, they would have their own happy ending, but…

‘Their real self dies.’

By the time they reached Oz, the curse of the Floating Island would have
already eaten away their life force, causing them to lose their life.

***That’s right. This piece of shit land was a sentient life form with
complete intelligence and it was a demon who played with humans as if
they were dolls.***

“Let’s depart again.”

“Y-yes…!”

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whoooosh───!*

Riding the light green wind, Kaya and I took flight towards Ian once
again. As expected, it was significantly faster than just running.

Of course, flying with the wind imposed a considerable burden on the
caster’s mana. However, if Kaya’s mana ran low, she could always switch
with Dark Kaya and utilize blood mana to replenish if necessary.

Anyway…

‘By now, they’ve probably figured out that I’m here.’

In my current \[Hunter\] state, I was stronger than the rare genius
Dorothy herself.

Even if the academy’s staff was having a difficult time detecting other
mana because of the Floating Island’s overwhelming presence…

There was no way that they wouldn’t notice my immense mana, which
practically rivaled that of the Floating Island.

‘They are probably in a frenzy, saying that the ‘Black Monster’ has
appeared.’

It didn’t matter that much though, since I had already reached the
Floating Island.

Additionally, during my \[Hunter\] state, my mana fluctuated very
briefly, so it would be difficult to track my location anyway.

The only thing I was worried about was them discovering how I had flown
to the Floating Island with Kaya.

In an emergency like this, if two students were spotted leaving the
academy, the academy’s staff would undoubtedly try to bring us back.

Ugh, just thinking about it gave me a headache.

Anyway…

‘Ian, hang in there buddy.’

I checked on Ian using \[Clairvoyance\]. He was riding on Rex while
dashing down the yellow brick road and defeating enemies with his sword
of light and fire.

***I’m so proud of you, Ian Fairytale. Go forth! Wipe out the demons
with your own hands.***

‘I’ll try to support you in whatever way I can.’

And in the end…

***…I’ll fuck up this overgrown mound of dirt***

Since I had already dealt with Heinkel the Hoarder, who would have
blocked Ian’s way, there should be no problems for him.

As such, I just had to eliminate the Floating Island’s minions.

And if Ian reached the Emerald Palace and sent \[Apostle of Light\]
flying towards the Floating Island’s core, ‘Oz’…

‘Objective 1 would be accomplished.’

\[Kekek… Welcome to the country of Munchk-\]

*Hwarereuk───!*

After casually bodying the Munchkin with \[Frostfire\], Kaya and I
continued heading towards Ian.

Chapter 107: Subjugation of the Floating Island (3)
===================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (3) ༻**

Märchen Academy Administrative Center, Bartos Hall.

In the central conference room, all key academy staff, with the
exception of Headmistress Elena Woodline, and the Hegel Magic Tower
Master were seated around a large round table.

In the very center of the table, a levitating island-shaped structure
emitted a mysterious light, rotating slowly in place.

This structure was intricately composed of mana grains tightly clustered
together…

And it was ultimately a creation of the Hegel Magic Tower Master; Aria
Lilias, the master of Elemental Magic.

Aria had received real-time information on the Floating Island from the
wizards of the Hegel Magic Tower; with this, she replicated its form and
constructed it in empty space.

For a brief moment, a pale blue flash occurred at a certain point on the
Floating Island. It was a tremendous amount of mana, comparable to that
of the Floating Island itself.

All key personnel who had gathered in this room were well aware of this
mana’s origin.

“Hegel Magic Tower Master, was that…?”

The Vice Headmaster noticed the identity of the vanished pale blue light
in an instant and widened his eyes.

“Black Monster. Appearance.”

Aria Lilias, a petite woman with reddish-brown hair spread to one side,
responded in an emotionless voice.

The Black Monster. An unidentified menace that suddenly appeared one
day, annihilated demons, and disappearing just as abruptly.

With the news of its appearance, all the key academy staff present in
the room were taken aback

“As expected, it appeared…”

“Whenever demons appear, it always shows up.”

“Damn it, are we supposed to trust it…?”

In Märchen Academy, their views on the Black Monster were tinged with
‘fear’.

It was undoubtedly a figure who had reached the level of an Archwizard.

According to Professor Fernando’s testimony, during the first semester,
it effortlessly used apocalyptic levels of magic and defeated the moon
demon that ruled over an entire world like a god.

In other words, the Black Monster was not something the academy could
handle; it had already surpassed the capabilities of the entire Empire.

Of course, the fact that the Black Monster continued to protect the
academy was well acknowledged by the academy staff as well.

However, without knowing its true identity or intentions, they weren’t
prudent enough to hastily extend favor to it.

“Black Monster. Our. Side.”

At that moment, Aria’s one statement descended upon the conference room.

“If too difficult to trust in the Black Monster, trust me instead.”

The pillar who supported Hegel Magic Tower, Tower Master Ariaa Lilias.

The woman whose insight remained unparalleled despite appearing clumsy
and confused, Märchen Academy Headmistress Elena Woodline.

Both of these women somehow held a remarkably favorable attitude toward
the Black Monster.

The reason that Märchen Academy had not been able to investigate the
identity of the Black Monster was also largely due to the influence of
these two women.

“…!”

Suddenly, a sinister mana swept in like the wind and brushed against
their skin, raising chilling goosebumps throughout everyone’s bodies.

A heavy silence filled the central conference room. Everyone present
felt the eerie mana that had flowed through the air just a minute ago.

Aria furrowed her brows and turned her head towards the window.

***Something was coming.***

“Enemies, from the ground…!”

On the grounds of Märchen Academy, white demons began to sporadically
emerge from the dirt.

From animalistic forms to forms of dwarves and witches; they were all
minionis created by the Floating Island.

While limping with creaking joints, they gleefully laughed ‘Nihihi’. The
demon collectively began to target Märchen Academy.

To them, human bodies were nothing more than beautiful ingredients that
could be used to cook up something for the Floating Island.

\[Nihihi!\]

Fuoooooo────!

\[Nyahaha!\]

*Kwakakang───!!*

\[Nehehe!\]

*Sseuk───!*

However, this was the greatest academy on the continent. Not only the
academy staff but also the students were overflowing with exceptional
abilities.

Both the staff and the students joined forces to resist the demons.
Magic clashed with magic and sword blades sparked as it cut down the
demons.

Thus, the academy waged a siege battle.

The academy allocated manpower to defend the institution and assembled
an elite force to subjugate the Floating Island,

The subjugation force rode on familiars capable of flight and charged
towards the Floating Island.

This expedition totaled a hundred members, consisting of
combat-specialized professors, Imperial Knights, security forces, and
some extremely powerful students.

However, in front of the Floating Island, which was comparable in size
to a small country, the scale of the subjugation force seemed infinitely
small, akin to dust in a room.

The goal of the subjugation force was to safely secure Ian Fairytale and
Mateo Jordana, who had left on their own to the Floating Island. They
also aimed to eliminate the demons controlling the Floating Island and
survive.

This was before it was revealed that the Floating Island itself was a
demon.

If the plan failed and the dark brown magic circle unfolding beneath the
Floating Island took its complete form, everyone would lose their lives.

As such, the pressure on the subjugation force to perform was immense as
they reached the Floating Island.

And as time passed–.

\[────────.\]

The sound of woodwind instruments shook the air. The wailing of the
Floating Island echoed through the sky and the sea.

Towards Märchen Academy, a threat incomparable to the summoned army of
minions over the Arkins Sea loomed.

Numerous magic circles already deployed on the body of the Floating
Island strongly emitted a reddish-brown light.

It was an indicator that it was about to unleash its magic.

The target was the island where the most prestigious institution on the
continent was located – Märchen Academy. It was right to say that it was
a place where high-level mana was densely concentrated.

In other words, the academy itself was already a formidable adversary
for the Floating IIsland.

And soon thereafter, the Floating Island vomited out its magic towards
Märchen Academy.

「Seismic Wave (Earth Element, ★8)」

*Kwaaaaang───────────!!!!!!*

Reddish-brown magic circles simultaneously unleashed a massive beam
toward the sea and the island where Märchen Academy was located.

In its wake, the waves roared mercilessly, violently shaking the island
and the sea.

“Kyaaak!”

“Everyone, take cover!!”

In an instant, as if breaking a cracker, diagonal lines were carved into
a part of the island, gradually forming tall cliffs.

The wizards among the staff combined their strength to cast powerful
protection magic in order to prevent the collapse of buildings while
repelling the beam attacks.

However, the Floating Islands \[Seismic Wave\] had only just begun.

*Kuuuuuuuuuu─────────!!!!*

A fierce wave, imbued with reddish-brown mana, surged onward.

It seemed as if a single wall that was traversing the entire world had
appeared. The height of the wave was immense, as if it was trying to
reach space itself.

The pressure of the giant wave, filled with high-density earth mana,
went beyond merely slamming against massive rocks or landmasses.

It effortlessly destroyed anything in its path as it broke solid chunks
of earth as if they were fragile clumps of soil and caused seismic
shafts.

The mere protection magic casted by the academy’s wizards could never
withstand it.

This was the level of the country-destroying magic, \[Seismic Wave\].

“What is this madness…”

At the top of Bartos Hall.

A woman in a white robe was watching the colossal wave approaching the
academy with an expression of despair.

Neatly tied back hair. An appearance maintained in her twenties thanks
to the Blessing of Eternal Youth. It was the rosy-haired beauty,
Headmistress Elena Woodline.

Why was she facing such crises one after another once she took office as
the Headmistress of Märchen Academy?

Suddenly feeling a deep self-doubt settled, Elena was on the verge of
tears while letting out a choked sound.

“I should’ve retired just a year earlier…”

She was already more than old enough for retirement.

If not for the Blessing of Eternal Youth, she would have been a wrinkled
and completely gray-haired elderly woman in her seventies.

However, her regret was only momentary.

Soon, she looked at the Floating Island with teary eyes.

Gripping her wand, she poured the entirety of her mana flowing in her
body.

“Fine. Come at me, asshole.”

As Headmistress Elenaa brandished her wand and poured out her mana, a
subtle petal-shaped mana began to float and a sturdy barrier spread
across the entire instituion.

*Koooooong────!!!!!*

\[Seismic Wave\] and Elena’s barrier clashed. A pink flame had burst out
with a deafening roar, as it rapidly covered the waves filled with earth
mana.

Soon after, a dull thud, akin to giant steel colliding with rocks,
echoed. It wasn’t a sound that one would expect from waves.

*Jjejejeok──.*

\[Seismic Wave\] exerted all its force to shatter the barrier, then sank
into the sea.

In its aftermath, another strong current emerged and fierce seawater
attempted to engulf Märchen Academy from all directions.

Elena poured out her remaining mana to restore the barrier.

No matter how powerful the waves were, ordinary seawater could never
break Elena’s barrier.

“Ugh…”

Elena’s mana was almost depleted because of the recent defense.

She leaned against a pillar, feeling a strong sense of dizziness when…

*Kwaaaaaaang─────!!!*

“…!”

Once again, beams filled with earth mana traversed the sea and a
reddish-brown wave began to approach.

Her mana had been completely depleted after blocking just one such
attack.

As such, facing a second country-destroying magic was excessive even for
someone like her.

Nevertheless, she could not retreat. She had to protect the students no
matter what.

Elena squeezed out the last iota of her mana. Although weaker than
before, she had to pour out all of it in order to somehow maintain the
barrier.

***Can she resist with just this?***

Elena furrowed her brow and bit her lips. It was probably… difficult,
but…

“I have to do it.”

With the determination to squeeze out every drop og mana she had, Elena
shut her eyes and focused her mind.

That was when it happened.

\[Kyaaaaaaaa─────!!!\]

At the thunderous roar of the approaching deadly torrent, Headmistress
Elena abruptly opened her eyes.

*Kreunggg────!!*

*Kwakang────!!*

Thunderclouds glowed purple and lightning fiercely cut through the air,
accompanied by thunderous sounds reminiscent of the wrath of gods.

A giant black grouse soared, spreading its wings wide, and scattered a
tremendous surge of lightning magic.

Headmistress Elena gazed at Thunderbird Galia in astonishment.

Underneath the Thunderbird, a female student stood on a cliff, exceeding
her right arm forward as she let out a massive amount of lightning mana.

Purple flashes of lightning only added to her elegant beauty.

“…”

At Märchen Academy, students with heaven-blessed talent were admitted
every year.

For example, compared to geniuses like Dorothy Heartnova or Alice
Caroll, even the prowess of the academy staff seemed trivial.

Among these geniuses, there was Luce Eltania, the top seat of the Magic
Department freshmen.

Violet thunderbolts extended around her as if forming chains in every
direction. Her rose-gold hair, cape shawl, and school uniform fluttered
wildly in the aftermath.

Her ocean-blue eyes reminiscent of the deep sea were directed towards
the Floating Island.

Empowered by the Thunderbird’s might, Luce’s mana merged with the magic
circle cast by Elena, as it spread across the entire island.

*Crackle──────!!!!!*

「Thunder God’s Barrier」

The powerful lightning barrier of the Thunderbird, which had shown
itself on the grounds of Märchen Academy during the first semester’s
end-of-semester evaluation, combined with the barrier cast by
Headmistress Elena Woodline.

This perfect fusion of magic was possible due to Luce’s overwhelming
level of \[Elemental Efficiency\].

*Crackle────!!!*

*Kooongggg────!!!!!*

Countless lightning bolts scattered, dispersing the mana imprinted on
the towering waves.

The Thunderbird was a legendary magical beast that had thrived for
centuries in the Thundercloud located southwest of Zelver. It now
boasted immensely high defensive capability as it generated the
lightning barrier.

Although the waves infused with earth element mana engulfed the barrier…

The \[Thunder God’s Barrer\] remained intact, only echoing with the
sound of discharges and the dull thud of collisions.

Even the subsequent aggressive waves were rendered useless, as the
\[Thunder God’s Barrier\] held firm, protecting Märchen Academy.

*Wooooong–.*

The aura of the ominous reddish-brown magic circle engraved on the
Floating Island’s body had now diminished.

It seemed like it was taking its time to regather itself before
unleashing the next attack.

At the top of Bartos Hall, Headmistress Elenna sighed deeply with relief
as she sat down.

\[Luce.\]

The calm voice of the Thunderbird echoed in Luce’s mind.

She raised her head abruptly and gazed at the colossal Thunderbird
soaring in the air.

Every time the magic beast flapped its wings, aggressive wind and violet
thunderstorms erupted.

\[What are you going to do now?\]

“I’m going to that island.”

While the violent current crackled and echoed in the air…

Luce fiercely looked at the Floating Island and responded with a cold
tone.

“After all, Greung must be there.”

The Black Monster, Greung, was always present whenever demons appeared.
As such, he would have definitely appeared on that massive island.

Luce was already nearly convinced that Isaac was the Black Monster.

Until now, she wasted a considerable amount of time searching for Isaac
when the Floating Island emerged.

If Isaac had reached the giant island as the Black Monster, it would
sufficiently explain why he couldn’t be found by Luce.

She wished to kick away all the lingering doubts she had by confirming
it with her own two eyes.

The confirmation that Isaac was Greung.

“Take me there.”

Luce gave a chilly command to the Thunderbird.

However, the Thunderbird simply tilted its head.

\[…It might be wise to reconsider.\]

“…?”

The Thunderbird was a legendary magical beast that was much stronger
than Luce.

With its tremendous mana perception, it had already sensed the enormous
mana emanating from someone on the Floating Island.

*Whooooosh─────!!*

In the distance, a silver wind tinged with frost began to swirl.

The wind swept widely, converting more than half of the Floating Island.
It was such a fierce storm that the sound even reached this distant
place.

And someone was controlling the existence beyond the wind, as if
handling a familiar.

The person’s formidable ice mana then exploded above the Floating
Island.

“…?”

At that moment, there was a group evacuating from the Floating Island.
Using her excellent vision, Luce identified them as the subjugation team
that had set out towards the Floating Island earlier.

Among them, Mateo Jordana could be seen carrying an unconscious Ian
Fairytale on his familiar.

Second seat Kaya Astrea was also there. Even as she left the Floating
Island, Kaya looked back with a worried expression.

“…!”

And in the sky, hundreds of massive magic circles filled the heavens.

Due to the vast silver wind from an unknown source, the colors of the
magic circles were indistinguishable. However, it was easy to surmise
that they were composed of at least 7-star magic.

\[Even if we go up to that island, we can’t do anything except die.\]

In the purple currents, Luce and the Thunderbird held their breath and
silently watched above the Floating Island.

Now, the sky had become a battlefield of monsters that even the
Thunderbird couldn’t approach.

\* \* \*

One hour ago.

“You guys are…?”

On top of the Floating Island.

Kaya and I stood still while looking down at an unconscious black-haired
young man.

Kaya was restless with bewildered and anxious eyes. Meanwhile, I just
stared at him blankly.

Right at that moment, Mateo Jordana, a brown-haired male student with
his bangs swept up, arrived and spoke to us.

But I just couldn’t find it in me to respond…

‘You were doing fine just a moment ago…’

The male student peacefully unconscious on top of the Floating Island
was, as always, Ian Fairytale.

<span id="0106_108_Subjugation_of_the_Floating_Island_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 108: Subjugation of the Floating Island (4)
===================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (4) ༻**

A game was different from reality.

Now that this world had become my reality, every time I witnessed Ian’s
top-tier fainting act, sighs involuntarily escaped me.

‘I understand, but…’

***Yeah, I get it. It’s possible to faint.***

The Floating Island was similar to the first year second semester
hunting evaluation, where the difficulty of the enemies increased the
more one approached the center.

In the first place, this world was based on the hell difficulty of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Even when I played the game, I had gone through countless retries, so I
wasn’t really in a position to say anything either.

***But still…***

‘Please, at least DODGE…!’

You could have easily predicted the surprise attack…

Ian had received a direct hit to the back of his head with an earth
magic attack and fainted from the shock.

Fortunately, the demons behind the surprise attack were defeated by us.

After Ian’s familiar, Rex, heard our plan from Kaya, he was reassured,
thus he unsummoned himself.

Since she had worked with Ian in the hunting evaluation, Rex seemed to
trust her.

When a familiar was summoned, it consumed the owner’s mana. It was a
cost to maintain the summoning. So, Rex, who was not needed, was better
off being unsummoned.

Ian had to unleash \[Apostle of Light\] using his full power towards Oz,
the core of the Floating Island. Therefore, to prepare for the worst,
unnecessary mana consumption needed to be minimized.

‘Let’s think positively.’

Rather than thinking ‘Ian fainted again,’ it was better for my mental
health if I thought, ‘It’s a relief Ian didn’t fucking die and just
fainted instead.’

I had already given up hope that Ian wouldn’t faint anyway, so my
emotions quickly calmed down.

“Why are you guys here…?”

Ah, I forgot Mateo was also here.

Kaya and I had our hoods off, so our attire was not inhibiting
recognition. As such, Mateo could easily recognize us.

This guy Mateo probably followed Ian’s path of destruction to come here
safely, but enemies were still scattered everywhere in the vicinity. For
someone like Mateo, it was a highly dangerous place.

Either way, he was probably going to join Ian and head toward the center
with his heroic protagonist delusi- I mean mindset. It would be safer
and better for him to just follow us.

“He can also be a transportation shuttle.’

Mateo flew here thanks to the hawk-shaped familiar next to him. The
wings wrapped in light brown wind boasted considerable style.

It wasn’t right for me to continue to rely on Kaya’s wind magic.

***Let’s ask Mateo for some help.***

“Did you chase after Mr. Ian?”

“Yeah. What about you guys?”

“Yes, we need him for our plan.”

“Plan…?”

As always, Mateo seemed confused.

“Whatever. It’s dangerous here, so follow us.”

I forcibly concluded Kaya and Mateo’s conversation. I didn’t want to
waste time with trivial small talk after all.

“Sir Isaac, what should we do with Mr. Ian?”

“Check his condition, treat him, and let him rest. Wake him up when we
arrive at the center of the island.”

“Understood!”

Now that we had met Ian and Mateo, we could sprint all the way to the
Emerald Palace.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 6, Chapter 1, Floating Island」, the
boss was Heinkel the Hoarder.

In the cut scene where Ian was in danger, he suddenly appeared and saved
him. Then, he proceeded to challenge him to a duel. If the player
defeated Heinkel, they could obtain \[Clairvoyance\].

After that, they would move onto 「Act 6, Chapter 2, Oz」.

The only characters that could be considered bosses in Act 6, Chapter 2
were the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, and the winged golden
monkey. In reality, they weren’t really bosses; just slightly stronger
mobs than the others.

‘They’ll probably get destroyed with just one hit from \[Frost
Explosion\].”

With \[Hunter\] activated, I practically had a free pass.

And our goal, Oz, the core of the Floating Island, was just a powerless
head with a loud voice.

He only threatened players with boasts such as, ‘I am the great and
fearsome wizard, Oz.’

In other words, I didn’t need to step forward as long as I entered the
Emerald Palace. It was enough to wake Ian up at that time.

***Okay guys, let’s wrap this up quickly.***

“Kaya, Mateo. Let’s go.”

“Yes, Sir Isaac!”

Full speed ahead.

\*\*\*

\[Wicked Witch of the West Elphaba\] **Lv:** 130

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Earth

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to rip you apart into itty bitty pieces.\]

\[Nihihihi! Guys, rip them to shre-!\]

*Kwaaaaaa────!!*

As we rode Mateo’s hawk familiar, we were powered by Kaya’s wind booster
to swiftly move toward the Emerald Palace.

Suddenly, the green-skinned witch wearing a pointed hat, ‘Elphaba’, and
a winged golden monkey demon popped out.

They were all mobs born from the Floating Island’s earth mana.

The Wicked Witch of the West Elphaba was letting out a laugh that
sounded like ‘Nihihihi’. Dorothy developed the habit of laughing in such
a manner from these demons.

The mental shock had probably caused her to laugh this way, but…

‘It doesn’t matter.’

If the demons laughed like that, it felt like utter shit. But if Dorothy
laughed like that, it was just cute. That was the important thing, so it
didn’t matter even if their laughs were similar.

Elphaba controlled a pack of wolf demons, a flock of crow demons, and a
swarm of bee demons.

I casted \[Frost Explosion\], shattering their bodies with the sheer
magnitude of my explosion, then imprisoned them within the aftermath of
ice so that they couldn’t move a single muscle.

*Jjejeok──, Kwang──.*

As I used Defrost to release the ice into its mana form, the Wicked
Witch of the West Elphaba and her subordinate turned into ash,
scattering in the wind.

It felt a bit unfamiliar, but the mana consumption for \[Frost
Explosion\] had now become extremely minimal.

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 87!\] \[You have gained 2 stat
points!\]

‘Noice.’

***Level up!***

I immediately invested the newly acquired 2 stat points into Growth Rate
\[Learning Efficiency\].

Incidentally, I wanted to quickly obtain the unique characteristic that
could be obtained by fully maxing out both \[Physical Training
Efficiency\] and \[Magic Training Efficiency\].

‘If I have that, my power will be greatly enhanced.’

However, there was a condition where I could only acquire that unique
characteristic starting from the second year, so for now, it was
regrettable that I couldn’t do so.

“…”

Mateo couldn’t close his mouth and was just staring at me blankly.

Come to think of it, this guy harbored the desire to catch up with my
skills during the first semester duel evaluation.

In my current \[Hunter\] state, I was the strongest in Märchen Academy.
As such, it seemed like he had fallen into a state of deep shock after
seeing that I had reached a far higher level than when facing Orpheus
the Submerged.

Soon thereafter, we reached the Emerald Palace.

*Kwaaaaaaaah────!!*

As the gatekeepers tried to speak, I immediately launched \[Frost
Explosion\], defeating them right away. After all, there was no time to
engage in conversation.

We then opened the arched door and entered the palace.

A spacious and solemn space. Inside, a gigantic curtain divided this
space in half.

Behind the curtain was the oval-shaped silhouette of a massive shadow.
Flames illuminated the surroundings with their fierce intensity.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, a cutscene played when the player
approached that area. I remembered the curtain revealing the large head
of a middle-aged man.

It was Oz, the core of the Floating IIsland.

‘I’ll leave that to them.’

I headed straight for the underground stairs next to me.

After all, Dorothy would be down there.

“Sir Isaac?”

“Leave that to Ian. Just tell him to cast \[Apostle of Light\] once he
wakes up.”

I looked at Ian lying on Mateo’s familiar as I answered. As expected, he
was still peacefully unconscious.

If he casted \[Apostle of Light\] at Oz, the protective magic enveloping
the Floating Island would be released.

When that happens, the demons of this landmass would probably go
berserk, but there were plenty of talents at Märchen Academy to defend
against their attacks, so I had nothing to worry about.

“Also, run away as soon as possible. If not, you’ll definitely die.”

Kaya nodded with a determined face. Since we had already discussed the
plan beforehand, she clearly understood my intentions.

It was because of the mana gas explosion; there was something like that
underneath the island.

When I tried to go down the stairs again, this time, Mateo spoke up.

“I didn’t hear an explanation. What are you trying to do, Isaac?”

I had completely forgotten to explain our plan to Mateo.

I didn’t really want to go into detail at this point and honestly, there
really wasn’t anything to hide, so I just pointed below and answered in
a calm voice.

“…I’m going to destroy this entire island.”

***I’m going to fuck up the Floating Island.***

***And save Dorothy.***

Those were my only goals from the very beginning.

Mateo was silent as he gulped his dry spit with an anxious face. It
seemed like he had anticipated that I would give such an answer in the
first place.

Anyway…

I ignored them and stepped forward once again.

A faint scent of flowers.

As I descended down the dark stair, a vast precipice leading into
profound darkness filled my sight.

And in the very center, a small beam of light mercifully cut through the
darkness.

From the distant abyss where nothing was visible, a long object was
rising out of it.

It was a repulsive pillar made up of various human body parts.

“…”

The owners of the body parts that made up the pillar were all
‘adventurers’.

Enchanted by the illusion of the Floating Island, these humans started
their adventure in the country of Munchkins and followed the Yellow
Brick Road. From there on out, they had adventures until eventually
reaching Archwizard Oz, who said he would grant any wish.

In an illusion where they rode hot air balloons and went beyond the
rainbow to return home, they would be reminiscing about the joyful
adventures that they had experienced, but…

In reality, they met their death, becoming pitiful victims of the
island.

And the minions of the Floating Island had carved up the bodies of these
very victims and adorned them here.

At the top of the pillar, there was a large black orb.

It was a barrier created by layering the Floating Island’s dark and
earth mana.

The ones who entered it were always the same; they were the ones who
completed their journeys. They met their death there as their life force
and mana were sucked dry by the Floating Island.

Dorothy was definitely inside that very orb.

However, that didn’t mean I could simply break through that barrier.

‘It would be CBR after all.’^1^TL Note: korean term: chemcal,
biological, radiologicala

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, attempting to break that barrier would
cause a toxic mana gas to explode, leading the player to their death.

It was an extremely powerful gas explosion that shattered the Emerald
Palace, spreading far and wide.

Extra Bad Ending N. 17 「The Untouchable」.

Yeah, the title of the Bad Ending was already a problem.

It sounded as if I shouldn’t save Dorothy no matter what because she
needed to be sacrificed.

‘But would I ever abandon Dorothy?’

***Never.***

Even if there were countless Bad Endings on the path to saving Dorothy.

As long as I was here, she had to be saved no matter what.

There was no other reason. In this regard, rational thought processes
were thrown out the window.

It was simple really…

***…Does a fan really need a reason to save their favorite character?***

While descending the stars. I discarded the black hooded robe.

I was only wearing it just in case I got caught by the academy staff
during the journey to the Floating Island anyway.

Next, I took out a navy blue robe and a black fanged mask from the magic
pocket inside my school uniform. It was the Magic Cloak of Disguise –
Berserker.

‘I haven’t worn it in a while.’

Märchen Academy and Hegel Magic Tower would have already judged that the
Black Monster had appeared on the Floating Island.

Even if I caught the attention of the subjugation force or the Magic
Tower observing the Floating Island, I would need them to pass it off as
‘Oh it’s the Black Monster’.

The Cloak of Disguise was a mess after my fight with Galia, but thanks
to the repairs, there were no functional issues.

Due to the silent surroundings, the rustling sound of the cloth brushing
against each other echoed in my ear.

After wearing the navy blue robe, I held the black mask engraved with
large fangs and molars in my hand and stopped in my tracks.

My gaze was still fixed on the black spherical barrier.

‘Is today the day Dorothy finds out…’

With the power of \[All In the World\], Dorothy could look into the very
essence of the world.

Even if I disguised myself as the Berserker, it was impossible to hide
from Dorothy’s eyes.

So today, Dorothy would likely realize the fact that I was the Black
Monster.

***Then… there was no need for the mask.***

*Cheeng───!!*

*Hwarererereuk───!!*

\[Kkkeeuahhhhk!!\]

The ceiling vibrated as if an earthquake had occurred while the sound of
holy flames and the screams of a middle-aged man echoed from above.

It seemed like Ian had properly fired off \[Apostle of Light\] at Oz.

*Chijiijik──.*

As a tearing sound was heard, the solidified paint on the wall that
encompassed the vast precipice began to peel away as if torn off.

It was as if a piece of paper was burning while rising into the air.

The inner layer made by the Floating Island’s mana tore away, brightly
letting out a pale brown light.

It was the sight of the Floating Island’s protective magic being
released.

The surroundings became bright, which was pretty nice.

The pillar made up of human body parts became even more vivid. It was
somewhat grotesque though…

Still, I felt pretty good.

“I’m already excited.”

With a faint smile on my lips, I casually monologued to myself.

***I wanted to see Dorothy soon.***

Chapter 109: Subjugation of the Floating Island (5)
===================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (5) ༻**

Dorothy Gale had always preferred running to walking.

In the vast meadows of a countryside village, she was an innocent child,
whose innocence was second to none.

Despite often causing trouble to the villagers with her pranks, which
sometimes led to minor accidents…

When the mud-covered girl brightly smiled as if all was well, the hearts
of the villagers melted.

“…Ah.”

As she opened her eyes, a desolate landscape unfolded before Dorothy’s
eyes.

It was the scenery of the village where Dorothy had once lived. However,
it was absolutely desolate, as if it had always been this way.

Her maternal aunt and uncle who lived with her were nowhere to be found.
Even her dog Toto was gone.

It all began with a tornado that struck one day.

Dorothy’s board-framed house was torn away by this tornado, soaring high
into the sky.

And that house landed in the country of Munchkins.

In this very strange fantasy land, Dorothy set out to find the
Archwizard Oz, who was said to grant any wish, in an effort to return
home.

As she followed the Yellow Brick Road…

She made friends with a Scarecrow who wanted a brain, a Tin man who
wanted a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who wanted courage.

After facing near-death situations and fighting the Wicked Witch,
Dorothy finally reached Archwizard Oz.

After obtaining her wish from the Archwizard Oz, she had requested to
return home. However, just as she was about to ride the hot air balloon
to her beloved village…

A fairy, who secretly harbored affection for Dorothy, intervened,
pulling her back to reality.

Only then did Dorothy realize that her adventures in this fantasy land
were nothing more than an elaborate illusion that was made to devour her
life force.

With the help of the fairy, Dorothy escaped from the massive floating
landmass and returned home.

However, by then, the Floating Island had already swept away her
hometown.

Even as the sunlight faded and a chilly wind blew, Dorothy, who was as
expressionless and silent as a scarecrow, stared at her hometown which
had turned utterly desolate.

When she lowered her eyes, the stigma of a curse engraved on her abdomen
was visible through her torn maroon dress.

What was left for Dorothy was nothing but an inevitable death.

The lonely moonlight shone sadly upon her.

In the dead of night, as rain fell and dawn broke, a rainbow appeared
beyond the vast wasteland, stretching across the world.

Even though the girl was soaked in the rain, she paid no attention to
it, endlessly gazing at the shining rainbow.

Up there, beyond the rainbow…

There was a place she had only heard about in lullabies.

As a sense of drowsiness overwhelmed her…

The young girl quietly fell into a deep slumber, wishing to wake up in
that beautiful dreamland.

The 9-year-old girl with lavender hair, Dorothy Gale, blinked open her
eyes and gazed at the vast sky.

She couldn’t tell when night had fallen, but the enchanting starlight
densely adorned the navy blue sky.

Although there was nothing around, her expression was remarkably serene,
unlike the version of herself in her memories.

“Heut!”

She abruptly lifted her torso.

“Well, what a nonsensical illusion!”

Dorothy had a laughing face as she sprung up.

“Hello? Is there nothing but baggage here?!”

She loudly shouted in a playful manner all by herself and started to
twirl around as if dancing.

The hem of her maroon dress swirled along with her steps.

“How cruel! Isn’t it too much to enjoy this romantic scene all by
myself?! Even the night sky is this beautiful!

The 9-year-old girl, who was a mere commoner, shouted as if she was a
Queen. However, she suddenly stopped as she felt soft tufts of fur
touching her leg.

Dorothy lowered her gaze with a face full of suspicion.

A dark brown puppy was sticking out its tongue, panting, while looking
at her.

“…”

Dorothy’s face trembled. Her expression gradually stiffened; so much so
that the lively and playful laughter from just a moment ago seemed like
a lie.

She knelt on the ground and embraced the puppy in her arms.

“Toto.”

She closed her eyes and called out the name of her beloved pet. The
small puppy snugly fit into the young Dorothy’s embrace.

Soon, a feeling of familiarity enveloped her. When she quietly opened
her eyes, the landscape of her hometown under the night sky began to
appear.

Villagers.

A board-framed house with a red roof.

Standing in front of such a house were Dorothy’s gray-haired aunt and
uncle who gazed at her affectionately.

Dorothy’s eyes widened and said, “Toto, wait a moment.” Before gently
placing the puppy Toto on the ground and approaching the board-framed
house.

As she stood there with some distance…

Dorothy forced a weak smile upon her face.

“It’s been a while since I’ve seen Aunt and Uncle! Nihihi, it seems like
I am going to join you soon.”

The fading flame of life felt much more palpable than she had imagined.
Dorothy was keenly aware that she was not far from death.

And just before death, a flash of light passed through her mind. Is this
part of the world? Or is it the threshold to the afterlife?

“Hey, you know…”

For Dorothy, there was no way to know, but it didn’t matter to her.

She just wanted to tell them her story.

“After everyone was gone, I thought… maybe I should just stop living,
you know? But I couldn’t do it. So, I decided to live diligently. Ah,
but it was so hard… It was so so hard! I bet there has never been a
beggar as destitute as me.”

As Dorothy recalled her past, she waved her hand with disgust.

“But even so, I earned some money while working as an adventurer… Made a
decent living, and got older… Then for some reason, I felt like I wanted
to experience something more fitting for my age. So, I entered the
academy. Well, I was naturally talented, so I didn’t really need to
attend classes, but still… It was so much fun!”

Before her death, she wanted to live a life suitable for her age.

And that was when she thought of the academy. Going to classes with
friends her age, taking the same exams, and bonding with peers… For
Dorothy, who had struggled so much all her life, it was her greatest
dream.

“As expected of me, I got a ton of demerits too, nehehe! But still, I am
pretty popular. I have a cute fan club President and many fans. Somehow,
everyone seems to like me so much! I don’t know why, but they just can’t
get enough of me\~!”

Dorothy placed her hand on her chest and closed her eyes as she spoke
triumphantly. Her tone was one of pride.

Her aunt and uncle silently listened to her story with smiling faces.

There were no sad tales. Dorothy only spoke of joyful stories that she
could laugh and chatter about.

Dorothy endlessly unfolded her tales of exciting adventures, described
delicious foods she had eaten, and recounted delightful incidents from
her time at the academy.

She even mixed in dumb jokes and erupted into uncontrollable laughter.

She vividly explained to them how much fun she had while living, almost
as if painting a picture of her life.

As she continued, her eyes gradually moistened and her voice slowed
down, as if time itself was stretching infinitely.

Gradually, tears began to trickle down Dorothy’s smiling face.

Even though she was sharing mundane everyday stories, her throat choked
up. Even when she tried to hold back her tears, they couldn’t help but
fall.

When she wiped away the tears with her palm and wrist, Dorothy continued
to wear the mask of a smiling face, as if it was just another beautiful
and joyful day.

Having finally met her aunt and uncle, she didn’t want to show them an
expression of sorrow.

Suddenly, her throat felt so tight that even her joyous stories could be
let out.

As she began to sniffle like she had a cold, she involuntarily let out a
sudden burst of uncontrollable laughter at her own ridiculousness.

Despite her attempts to hold back tears, more and more sobs continued to
spill out.

Dorothy covered her face with both hands, as her head drooped low.

Struggling to find the strength to speak, she took a moment, before
finally uttering the words she had most wanted to say.

“…I missed you.”

Dorothy’s heart crumbled.

Whenever she tried to capture the beautiful parts of the world in her
eyes, she always saw them.

And when she endlessly watched their lovely smiles peer down on her…

…She couldn’t help but hope that one day, she could return to their
embrace.

It was a serene night.

The cold, bright moonlight and the twinkling starlight quietly
overlooked the young girl who was now shivering and sobbing.

In this desolate land of her hometown, the girl attempted to fall into a
deep slumber that she would never wake up from.

Reality was different from the fantasy world of dreams, romance, and
unending adventures.

In reality, Dorothy had nothing. No precious people. No beloved
hometown. All that remained was a stigma that indicated a looming
deadline; she had less than ten years left before facing death.

However, the girl desired to shine.

Even if nothing but despair remained in her dull life, she decided to
live like the protagonist of a play.

She decided to savor every beautiful bit of her remaining years.

And so, she endured.

If the girl learned anything throughout her whole life, it was how to
endure.

Dorothy’s aunt and uncle approached before embracing her tightly.

An impoverished countryside village. Dorothy’s beloved people, who had
loved her even when she was just an orphan.

Dorothy lowered both hands and forced herself to smile once again.

Her aunt wiped away the tears in Dorothy’s eyes.

Dorothy tried to clearly engrave the face of her beloved aunt deeply
into her memories.

But suddenly…

In the far distance where the rainbow had risen, the opposite side of
the world became covered in dazzling starlight of various colors.

As if contrasting with where Dorothy was, half of the world was
enveloped in a dazzling light.

As she watched the changing world with a surprised expression, Dorothy
soon realized what was happening and erupted with wry laughter.

“Well then\~.”

Dorothy innocently smiled and kissed her aunt, uncle, and Toto on the
cheeks before lifting herself up.

“Aunt, Uncle, Toto! I’ll go join you a little later! After all, someone
said he would come and save me!”

With the starlit world to her back, the 9-year-old girl had her hands
behind her as she let out a bright smile.

“He’s the president of my fan club. He always works like some training
fanatic and pours all his time into improving himself. Sometimes he
seems smart, but he’s actually a complete fool… Even so, he’s incredibly
cute. Since he said he would come and save me, I’ll gladly get saved.
Nihihi.”

Her aunt and uncle wore subtle smiles.

How were they so lovable? How could she not heart-wrenchingly miss them?

Dorothy suppressed her overwhelming emotions and began to take a few
steps backward.

***“That’s why… I’ll be coming a little later… I love you.”***

With those words, Dorothy Gale turned around and walked toward the
radiant world of starlight.

As she set foot in that world, the 9-year-old girl transformed into a
respectable student.

Wearing a witch hat on her head and donning a Märchen Academy uniform,
this student was an incomparably unique and rare genius. She was the
‘Witch of Stars’.

***She was Dorothy Heartnova.***

“I’m already excited.”

With light footsteps akin to a bouncing rabbit.

Dorothy pressed down her blue witch hat, as she let out a genuine laugh.

She couldn’t wait to see Isaac.

\*\*\*

The frosty silver wind, \[Frostwind\], blew fiercely.

The Floating Island’s yellow mana gas, capable of leading anyone to
their deaths, exploded, obliterating the Emerald Palace into
smithereens.

However, \[Frostwind\] quickly swirled as it dispersed the mana gas.

A silver-blue-haired male student easily deflected the threat of death
that came his way with \[Ice Sovereign’s Majesty\].

Then, with the rock gauntlet he had made from partially summoning his
golem familiar, Eden, he shattered the black spherical barrier in one
blow.

With the clear sound of shattering glass, the barrier collapsed.

And what he saw was a lavender-haired female student with half of her
body absorbed into a black pillar. Black spots akin to flames were
blooming all over her body.

The boy dispelled the partial summoning of Eden and stood still before
her.

Unexpected beams of light poured out as she weakly opened her eyes.
Then, while slowly lifting her head, she silently stared at the male
student who had come all this way to find her.

The man, who stood with beams of light behind him, looked very familiar.

“…”

Suddenly, she realized how ridiculous this all was.

After all, she, who had once given up on everything and accepted death,
now had so many things she wanted to do just because of a few words from
this man.

As if it was natural to come and save her, the man spoke in a peaceful
and calm voice.

“Let’s go back.”

Although her body was devoid of strength…

Dorothy managed to squeeze out whatever strength she had left and let
out a weak smile with great difficulty.

After all, if possible, she wanted to face Isaac with a smile.

Chapter 110: Subjugation of the Floating island (6)
===================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (6) ༻**

\[───────!\]

The sound of woodwind instruments filled the heavens.

Above the Floating Island.

A white dragon straight out of myths, Frost Dragon-Hilde, soared and let
out cold air, spreading her magnificent white wings as far as they could
reach.

Around that white dragon, a widespread \[Frostwind\] swirled with fierce
intensity.

I smashed the remainder of the black pillar with my fist and pulled out
Dorothy, princess-carrying her in my arms.

It seemed like she didn’t even have the strength to keep her body
stable, as she continued to exhale laborious breaths.

Her eyes were barely open, gazing at my face.

“Pres… ident…”

A dying voice.

I didn’t bother to reply. After seeing Dorothy in such a poor state, I
didn’t want to force a conversation.

Instead, I revealed a smile to reassure her. That I had come here
specifically for her.

This was the moment I had so longed for.

In every playthrough of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had only dreamed of
this moment. After all, I wanted to rescue Dorothy at any cost.

***To me, who was immersed in my preparations for the state exam, your
radiant figure, determined to shine despite having nothing left, was
incredible.***

***I hated the thought of you dying.***

***Let’s live on without making sacrifices, okay?***

***For your sake, I’ll deny the very reality of this scenario and crush
this overgrown pile of dirt.***

That was my oath. My resolve. From the very beginning, the only thing I
could think of was saving Dorothy.

Using \[Clairvoyance\], I saw Ian’s party joining the subjugation team
before escaping from the Floating IIsland.

As planned, Kaya had probably persuaded the subjugation team to flee as
soon as they met by saying that the Black Monster had shown itself once
again.

So, I had to do my part too. At the right moment, I activated
\[Hunter\], destroying the surroundings and pouring out a frigid chill.
As such, the subjugation team seemed to sense the danger and decided to
escape.

The Black Monster was an unstoppable force. The perception that it was a
dangerous Archwizard capable of using apocalyptic levels of magic was
widespread.

If such a monster was deliberately challenging the Floating Island, it
was only reasonable to escape before the fight escalated.

‘Also, when did Ian faint again…?’

*Oh so* surprisingly, Ian was being carried away by the subjugation
team, already unconscious.

I speculated that he was hit on the head by the debris of the Emerald
Palace that fell due to the impact of shooting \[Apostle of Light\] at
Oz, the core of the Floating Island.

‘But now, there’s no need to worry about him.”

After all, Ian’s role here was done. I was grateful for what he had done
up to this point.

When I raised my head, a huge sinkhole was visible. It was probably from
the shock of the mana gas exploding out of the Floating Island.

Above it, my familiar, Hilde, was sweeping through the battlefield with
\[Frostwind\].

\[Frostwind\] had the property of enhancing Hilde’s ice magic, as well
as her owner’s. Simultaneously, it could be used as a blinding
technique.

As I harbored hostility and confronted the Floating Island with my
familiar, I was currently in a state where \[Hunter\] was activated.

Thanks to this, my body felt incredibly light, allowing me to
effortlessly leap and land outside.

*Whooooosh───.*

\[Frostwind\] shone with the radiance of white jade, a much more vivid
color than I had expected.

‘With this, I don’t need to disguise myself.’

I probably didn’t need to uncomfortably wear a mask to disguise myself.
I could confidently rely on my full power.

*Koong──.*

While boasting her gigantic figure, the white dragon, Hilde, descended
and lowered her head to me. Her descent alone caused highly dense cold
mana and a storm of dust to scatter, making the ground tremble in her
wake.

After placing the powerless and limp Dorothy on Hilde’s back, I used
\[Rock Generation\] to keep her firmly in place.

I casted \[Ice Barrier\] and \[Stone Barrier\] around her to neutralize
my own ice and rock magic, thus keeping her safe from any harm that may
befall her.

Dorothy tried to say something, but her voice didn’t seem to come out
properly.

The curse was still gradually devouring her life force and mana. She
wouldn’t have any strength left to even speak.

“Just wait for me…”

***It’s okay. Everything will be fine.***

***“…Until I break this thing apart.”***

Dorothy’s two eyes widened slightly. It was hard to tell whether she was
surprised by what I said or not. I couldn’t read her psychology so I
decided to just move on.

My hair and the navy blue cloak fluttered because of \[Frostwind\]. In
contrast, Dorothy seemed to be enclosed in a serene world within the
protective barrier I had created.

***It’s finally time.***

I turned away from here and gazed at the fantasy world, ‘Land of Oz’.

Behind me, Hilde soared upward while carrying Dorothy.

After spreading her massive wings, she scattered white jade-colored
frost mana like a gust of wind.

\[───────!!\]

The Floating Island vibrated as if an earthquake had occurred. From an
unknown place, the eerie sound of woodwind instruments resonated with a
scream, tormenting my eardrums.

It had sensed my mana and felt threatened. However, I paid it no mind.

After casually rotating my shoulder and stretching…

I flipped on my hood and bloomed ice mana on my right palm. Pale blue
frost flowed and small ice crystals floated around.

With that, I quietly surveyed this world.

***From now on, I’ll completely annihilate the Land of Oz.***

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ Chapter 2, 「Back Story – Wizard of Oz」.

In the actual fairy tale, Dorothy returned to her hometown after
completing her adventure in the fantasy world and was held in her aunt’s
embrace, thus fulfilling her very own happy ending.

However, in this world, Dorothy could only return to her hometown with
the grim reality of despair.

Even so, she chose to stand up and shine.

She decided to show this fucked up world just how impressive of an
existence she was with all her might.

And so, her final act was a noble sacrifice.

To defeat an enemy that no one in the academy could overcome, she threw
away the last embers of her life with a face filled with laughter. As
such, she met the conditions to activate \[Last Light of a Dying Star\]
and brought down the Floating Island.

***…But, how can I tolerate such a thing?***

***You said you wanted to live.*** ***That’s all the more reason why I
can’t simply give up on you.*** ***And now, I am here. Just for you.***
***I’m standing in this place, at this time… just for you.*** 「Ice
Sovereign (Ice Element, ★9)」

My hair stood on end.

The saturation of my skin increased and the energy of the Ice Sovereign
flowed quietly from the depths of my heart.

\[Ice Sovereign\]. Its effects were straightforward.

It maximized the power of the ice magic I used.

Unlike in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I possessed a 9-star passive skill
\[Ice Sovereign\], the legendary weapon Frostscythe, and commanded the
mythical magic beast Frost Dragon-Hilde as my familiar.

Therefore, my full power easily surpassed the Floating Island’s Level
190.

However, I wouldn’t be able to maintain the \[Ice Sovereign\] state for
long.

‘At best, 10 minutes or so.’

It wasn’t a precise estimate. It was just an instinctive judgment that I
could maintain the \[Ice Sovereign\] state for roughly 10 minutes.

I brought out the Frostscythe stored within my body and firmly grasped
it; a frigid chill gathered in my outstretched right hand, forming the
shape of a large scythe with a dark blue glow.

An outpour of cold air.

As I lightly embedded the tip of Frostscythe into the ground, the pale
blue mana turned into dozens of ripples before spreading out.

In an instant, the rigor of winter swept through the Floating Island.

Then, I upped the ante of my mana.

*Wooooong──.*

Hundreds of large magic circles were instantly generated in the sky.

And I extended the blade of Frotscythe slightly forward and calmly gave
my command.

***“Hilde, freeze it all.”***

Hilde aggressively roared and poured out ice mana.

\[Kaaaaaaaa────!!!\]

Above Hilde’s head, a magnificent pale blue magic circle, brimming with
a tremendous amount of mana, was conjured.

Without hesitation, the white dragon poured out a large-scale silver
magic from the magic circle.

「Hell of the Crimson Lotus (Ice Element, ★8)」

A series of white streaks were engraved in the air.

In an instant, they grew in size, forming the shape of silver beams of
light enveloped in frost.

*Kwaaaaaaahhhhh──────!!!*

A violent explosion dyed the landscape white.

Ice magic at a country-destroying level, \[Hell of the Crimson Lotus\].
With intensely cold air, it transformed the earth into an icy hell.

At the same time, I aimed at the Land of Oz which was covered in a hazy
mist, and launched giant masses of ice from hundreds of magic circles.

*Kuoooooooo─────!!!*

*Kwangggg──────!!!!*

Dozens of gigantic ice masses encasing rock flew toward the Floating
Island as it let out white cold air. It was like a hail straight out of
a frozen hell as it fell and reached incredible speeds.

Each chunk had the power to effortlessly destroy the entire grounds of
Märchen Academy.

「Winter Shower」

Every time the comets of ice struck the Floating Island, the densely
packed ice mana exploded and—.

A massive physical impact. The ground trembled and space twisted, as it
was accompanied by a deafening roar that seemed to tear through
eardrums.

Fragments of the Floating Island scattered through the air. As the hard
shell that resembled ordinary ground broke apart. The squishy interior
of the red body began to reveal itself.

Like a human, it seemed to be a living organism with various organs.

Countless sharp icicles repeatedly poured out with such momentum that
they seemed to pierce the sky. Additionally, blizzards and storms
fiercely swept through with \[Frostwind\].

Explosions repeated ceaselessly and the thunderous noise showed no signs
of stopping.

At this moment, roars shook the heavens, and all hell broke loose.

“Eden, assist.”

I summoned the golem familiar, Eden.

As I infused rock mana to reinforce him, he rapidly grew and was
enveloped in rock skin to become a giant.

\[Guoooooo───!\]

Eden struck a colossal fist of rock toward the Floating Island.

A violent sonic boom echoed and, as if a meteor had collided, immense
air pressure had spread in all directions, creating a sandstorm.

Hilde unleashed her magic, Eden swung his fists in a barrage, and
\[Winter Shower\] continued to rain down.

And in such a place, I listened to the painful cries, akin to the
wailing of woodwind instruments, from the tormented Floating Island.

Slowly, I made my way across hell.

My chest boiled from within. My heart raced.

Was it because I had endured \[Ice Sovereign\] for several minutes? I
felt out of place, almost as if I was stepping into another world.

A heavy yet captivating melody flowed in my mind and from somewhere deep
in my body, a strange sensation wriggled.

If I took just a few more steps forward, it felt like I would awaken
someth–

\[───────!!\]

As expected, the Floating Island didn’t passively endure my attacks.

The Floating Island’s earth magic transformed into beams of light and
relentlessly struck in clusters.

The scale of each attack was immense. There was no point in evading.

I swiftly swung my arm laden with mana and raised towering walls of ice
and rock from the ground.

Within the pale blue ice walls, light brown rock mana flowed; it was the
elemental magic, \[Fossilized Ice\].

The densely concentrated elemental wall firmly took its place like a
sturdy fortress and blocked the onslaught of the Floating Island’s beams
of light.

Earth elemental attacks relentlessly poured out. This vast demon
landmass howled in agony as they counterattacked incessantly.

However, this wasn’t a sign of the bastard’s defeat.

\[HurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurtsHurts.\]&lt;/b&gt;

A multitude of faces suddenly emerged from the ground beneath my feet.

Their eyes were hollow with a vacant void instead of eyes. They
expressed their agony as their lips moved rapidly.

“Shut u-!”

*Kuuuuoooooooo───!!*

Abruptly, the ground beneath me began to relentlessly surge towards the
sky.

Crushed by the heavy pressure, I knelt on one knee and bowed my head.

There was nowhere to escape. The vast ground itself was rising after
all.

Consecutively, from far above the sky, I could feel immense mana beyond
the clouds.

I glanced briefly when suddenly, something descended towards me while in
the midst of a torrent of flames.

It was an enormous meteorite.

Enveloped in earth mana, a golden mana extended like a tail behind the
meteorite as it was enveloped in a deadly blaze.

I clenched my fist before striking the rising ground.

*Kwannnggggg────!!*

A sonic boom. My fist unleashed explosive power.

The surging ground shattered into pieces. The resulting shockwave pushed
my hood away.

Amidst the fragments of the Floating Island that flew in all directions,
my body floated in the air.

I turned my body towards the meteorite that was hurtling my way.

If others witnessed this scene, I would appear infinitesimally small and
feeble compared to the size of the meteorite the Floating Island had
thrown.

However, in my \[Ice Sovereign\] state, I could easily block a meteorite
of that magnitude with my magic.

After releasing \[Fossilized Ice\] that was set up around me…

I generated the 6-star ice elemental magic, \[Frost Wave\], and
stretched my arm toward the meteorite.

At that moment.

\[Nihihi.\]

A child-like giggle.

The formidable mana I had felt from the Floating Island just moments
ago, now erupted with a terrifying intensity, spreading through the sky
like ripples in a pond.

Sensing such mana, I couldn’t help but feel bewildered.

‘What is this…?’

My two eyes trembled.

As I turned my head downward, many heads filled the ground, as they
stared at me with those eyeless, pitch-black, and hollow eyes.

With grotesquely contorted expressions, they looked up at me and…

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

\[Nihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!\]

They started to mock me with their laughter.

Almost as if to say, ‘You were fooled, right?’

*Hwahhhhhhh───.*

The Floating Island’s body was stained with the color of red wine. Even
the heads emerging from the ground were dyed in such a color.

The ground cracked and split open in various places.

Earth mana took the form of lava, erupting intermittently from the
fissure. Its heat even overwhelmed \[Frostwind\].

Amidst the continuous eruption of lava and the mass of black smoke
billowing up…

Demons made of black volcanic rock with blood flowing like lava emerged
in a steady stream.

“Don’t fuck with me…”

I couldn’t close my agape jaw.

\[Geuheheheheheheheh───.\]

Beyond the Floating Island, from every direction…

Colossal beings emerged from the sea as if to trap me.

Beyond the \[Frostwind\] that devoured the lava, misty currents
surrounded the gigantic demons and seawater cascaded down like a
waterfall.

In their bodies made of black rock, lava flowed between the cracks where
the rocks were joined.

With their heads resembling tigers and their bear-like bodies, they were
incredibly massive.

These humongous one-eyed giants only looked towards me, as they revealed
twisted smiles.

Each one of them was a minion of the Floating Island.

\[Kalida the Freakish\] **Lv:** 185

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Earth

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:** \[Wants to smack you down with its palm.\]

Each entity was stronger than Hilde.

In all my time spent on ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had never seen such
a sight.

In other words, this was a form of the Floating Island that I had been
unaware of.

“…”

Only then did I realize.

Dorothy sacrificed her life using \[Last Light of a Dying Star\] to
overwhelm the Floating Island.

Because of that, the Floating Island was defeated without a chance to
release its true form.

Dorothy could only judge that nobody was able to defeat the Floating
Island because she possessed the power of \[All in The World\], which
could penetrate the essence of everything.

\[Cavallion the Earthshaker\] **Lv:** 200

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Earth

**Danger:** Extreme

**Psychology:** \[Wants to toy with you before tearing you limb from
limb..\]

In human terms, the Floating Island was an existence that had reached
the level of an Archwizard.

It knew how to control the maximum amount of its mana, thus the bastard
could hide its full power to appear like it was only level 190.

When I turned my gaze, I saw Hilde pouring out ice magic towards the
Floating Island.

On her back, I could see Dorothy, who looked at me with eyes full of
worry, even amidst her difficulty to move.

The vast reddish-brown magic circle generated beneath the Floating
Island was preparing to erase the island where Märchen Academy was
located without a single trace.

As the true identity of the Floating Island was revealed, the speed at
which the magic circle was conjured became even faster.

At best, I had a few tens of seconds before a magic circle that would
turn this surrounding area into a field of destruction was completed.

***That’s right. This bastard had been playing with humans all along.***

As it revealed itself as a threatening existence to the whole world, it
enjoyed watching humans rush towards it to stop it.

Now, there was not much time left.

There was nowhere to escape.

If I didn’t quickly annihilate this massive landmass…

***Everyone would die.***

***Everything would come to an end.***

***Just because I wished to save Dorothy.***

In order for this world to reach a happy ending, it seems as if fate
itself was forcing me to accept the noble sacrifice of one female
student.

***Sacrifice.***

***Why was such a fucked up sacrifice so important to this world?***

“…Ha… Fuck.”

With such thoughts, I spit out a curse.

***How can I accept such a proposition, such a scenario, when I was
here?***

***I will save Dorothy, I will prevent a bad ending. I will, no matter
what.***

…\[Frozen Soul\] was honestly relentless in that whenever I was on the
verge of forgetting about it, the effect returned and my mind calmed
down.

I turned my head upwards again.

Underneath the falling meteorites.

As I plummeted from high above the sky, I blinked my eyes sharply.

*Babump.*

An unknown pressure tightly squeezed my heart. Something within me was
urging me to wield the ice mana even more firmly.

Almost as if it was telling me to wield my power, \[Ice Sovereign\],
completely.

When I maintained the \[Ice Sovereign\] state, I felt a sensation as if
I was stepping into a new realm with each passing minute.

Deep within my body, I heard a booming sound, as if someone was
incessantly knocking on a giant iron door.

I didn’t know why this was happening.

However, at this moment, anything that could lend me strength would be
welcome with open arms.

Firepower that could blast the Floating Island out of existence. That
was all I needed.

But… Unfortunately, I still didn’t have enough power to open that door.
I had not reached that level yet.

‘If so…’

I had to open it, even if I had to force it open.

If I looked back at my previous experiences, this situation filled with
despair was honestly no different from any other crisis I had gone
through.

Life never flowed according to my intentions.

Even while knowing the scenario of this world, my plans still tended to
go entirely haywire and tangled.

It was nothing new. It was just something I had to persistently
overcome.

Along with the falling meteorites, a horde of ‘Kalida the Freaksih’ were
extending lava-enveloped arms towards me, who was still in the air.

Just moving their fists or arms created tremendous air pressure.

The reddish-brown magic circle continued to be conjured above the
Floating Island and lava pillars stretched towards me with terrifying
force.

Although the Floating Island targeted me, attacking from all sides…

–At that moment, I held an item in my arms.

A shabby worn-out key.

\[Key to Mysteries\] A key imbued with mysterious magic. It is used to
open the doors to a certain underground area. It can be used anywhere.

Rank: Tier 1

\[※Caution: Numerous deadly threats will target you upon use.\]

I could go to the Netherworld if I used this key.

The effective range included everything in direct contact with me.

I recalled when Ian used the ‘Key to Mysteries’ in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, the demonic creature hit by the light elemental power he
emitted was also transported to the Netherworld.

The demonic creature, after stepping into the Netherworld, melted away
in order to teach the player the dangers of such a world.

In other words, the effective range included everything in contact with
my magic. Moreover, since my familiar was a manifestation of my power,
it would also follow along.

Since everything that went to the Netherworld with the power of this key
also followed when returning, if I failed to defeat the Floating Island
in the Netherworld…

‘I would die as well.’

Even so, I had to try whatever I could.

I created dozens of pale blue magic circles around me. I casted the
powerful 6-star magic, \[Frost Wave\], thus pouring out intense cold
air.

*Chararararak─────!!*

The cold produced from my mana rushed out with tremendous force, as it
froze meteorites, clouds, and even the fists of Kalida the Freakish.

Although I couldn’t completely break the momentum of the lava, this
should be enough.

The cold air generated by \[Frost Wave\], along with the Hilde’s
\[Frostwind\] swept through like a hurricane.

Just like how it worked in many games, if you got to have a phase 2….

“This time, it’s my turn.”

***Let’s go to my phase 2 as well.***

I extended the ‘Key to Mysteries’ into the air.

When I harbored the intention to turn the key, something clicked. An
unseen door emitted an alien light, locking the key in place.

Without hesitation, I turned the key.

*Guooooooooo━━━━━━━━━━━━.*

From somewhere, a massive mouth not of this world appeared and swallowed
everything.

Chapter 111: Subjugation of the Floating Island (7)
===================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island (7) ༻**

A black sky.

The sky was engraved with countless lunar-like substances, each boasting
an alien violet glow.

The countless moons seemed to have their own gravity, as unidentifiable
auroras twisted and turned, avoiding such substances.

Hilde and Dorothy, who was riding on top of her back, looked around with
astonished expressions.

Kalida the Freakish and the minions that filled the Floating Island to
the brim scrutinized this new world with looks of incongruity.

Beneath the Floating Island, extending beyond the horizon, was a web of
white land that stretched out like a net.

A sweet scent akin to nephentes wafted from under the cliff where the
carcasses of various grotesque creatures piled high into the sky.^1^TL
Note: Nephentes is a type of seductive plant.

*Kwaaaaaaah───────────!!!*

The center of the Floating Island.

I continuously gathered and combined my mana before unleashing a violent
explosion of ice.

A brilliant radiance filled the landscape. The explosion of pale blue
mana shattered the Floating Island, covering the minions in a frigid
chill.

A mass of ice, akin to a tower, stretched towards the empty sky.

One after the other, I began to unleash a bombardment of ice and rock
spells onto this uselessly vast demon landmass.

「Absolute Zero」

Dozens of **\[Winter Shower\].**

「Meteor Shower」+「Golden Meteor」 「Frost Wave」

\[Abyssal Glacier\], which froze and completely neutralized the Floating
Island’s attacks.

「Frost Explosion」+「Frost Explosion」+「Frost Explosion」

This place was the perfect spot to rapidly level up: The edge of the
Nether.

Various grotesque creatures, without fear or rational judgment, leaving
only combat instincts, flew at me with the intent to kill. However, they
were all swallowed by the magic I unleashed.

Blood poured from my mouth. Abusing the power of \[Ice Sovereign\] had
taken its toll on my body. I wouldn’t be able to endure for much longer.

It had already been well over ten minutes.

The side effects of \[Ice Sovereign\]. Pain akin to being pricked by
thorns encompassed every corner of my body. Intense agony, as if my
organs were bursting, overwhelmed me.

Even so, I couldn’t stop here. If I stopped here, I wouldn’t be able to
move anymore.

My rationality was numbed.

I simply roared like a beast, swinging my fist and pouring out mana onto
Cavallion the Earthshaker.

Yet, in the midst of everything, I recalled the conversation I had with
Dorothy when we danced.

─‘President, there’s something I wanna try.’

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 88!\]

─‘Well, I heard that Regel’s Croissants are really famous for being
tasty. Let’s go and eat some together.’

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 89!\]

***Just like some cliché narrative, I have always considered myself the
protagonist of my own life.***

***However, in reality, my life is tainted with an unchanging shade of
gray.***

Even in the hellish realm filled with massive explosions and cold air,
the only sight reflected upon my eyes was a single cramped room.

If one looked around, it was filled with *‘You can do it’* books that
would only be seen in bookstores or complicated legal jargon written on
little Post-Its that were stuck to the wall.

And below that, thick law books were stacked higher than my height.

***It hadn’t been a radiant life for sure.***

─‘Oh, and did you know? Lake Frey in the Astrea Duchy is supposed to be
really pretty. I saw it in a book. Let’s go see that too.’

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 90!\]

─‘They say the moss forest inside the Vantus Woods in Medelnook is super
pretty too.’

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 91!\]

***That’s why the way you commanded your own life was truly amazing to
me.***

***Even when you harbored a heart that was on the very edge of collapse,
you, with your seemingly innocent smile, lived resiliently in this world
regardless.***

***You wouldn’t know how much healing I received just by witnessing that
side of you, Dorothy.***

***So this time, I thought I’d paint you a world full of possibilities.
Just for you.***

─‘So that’s why…’

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 92!\]

In my chest, a dull sound echoed in my ears, as if a massive iron door
was being knocked on again and again.

Above the empty grass field, I began to feel the presence of an iron
door, sealed with tightly-wound chains.

I didn’t know what it was, but one thing was certain.

The presence sealed behind that iron door was my power.

Just one step. I just needed to take one more step.

I strained both of my eyes. I ignored my increasingly numb body. I paid
no mind to the cascading red blood pouring from my eyes and mouth.

Although I faltered at times, my determination moved me steadily towards
the iron door emanating an immense frigidness.

─‘I’m hoping you’ll still continue meeting with this Big Sis like this
even after I graduate, President.’

The sound of rattling chains.

Finally, my hand touched the chain enveloping the iron door.

And I forcefully unraveled them.

“…Haa.”

A sigh escaped from me.

The \[Ice Sovereign\]’s pale blue chill that emanated from my body took
on the form of massive wings.

And the gentle ice mana flowing from my mouth extended out like streams
of flames, flickering like will-o’-wisps.

At long last, I felt like I had properly stepped into the pinnacle of
the ice element.

After all, just by standing here, the entire area was frozen solid.

\[Keuhahahhahahahak───!!\]

Kalida the Freakish deployed a magic circle towards me and vomited out
its magic.

A scorching shockwave ripped on the ground and an inescapable wave of
lava surged towards me.

“…”

***How uninteresting.***

I casually extended my arm towards the wave of lava and condensed my ice
mana before releasing it.

*Kwaaaaaaaah━━━━━━━━━━!!!*

「Frost Explosion」

A powerful explosion of ice pushed back the lava, freezing a fifth of
the Floating Island in an instant.

A colossal chunk of ice extended violently, freezing Kalida the Freakish
that had attacked me, alongside its lava.

I realized.

At this moment, my frigid aura could freeze everything in this world.

\[────────!!!\]

The Floating Island seemed to sense its crisis, as it emitted a sound
akin to a woodwind instrument.

Above in the sky…

An iron door larger than the Floating Island had silently appeared as if
it was drawn on the canvas known as the heavens.

The intense chill emanating from it was my own.

Intuitively, I also knew that I was the one who had pulled it out.

I lifted my head and cynically gazed at the iron door.

*Koooooo────.*

The iron door swung open and a radiant pale blue light poured out.

With just that, an immense cold swept throughout this world.

The absolute cold emanating from that being could bring about an ice age
with its mere presence.

One after another, countless magic circles unfolded in the air.

These numerous magic circles shot out chains, entwining the being inside
the iron door.

It wasn’t my magic nor was it the magic of the Floating Island.

Providence of the Nether.

Even Providence itself stepped in to stop the being I had brought out.

Within the iron door, a colossal arm, entwined in the chains of
Providence, reached out and gripped the door frame.

Each time it did so, a dull sound echoed and a dark blue aura burst
forth.

Soon thereafter, a black monster jumped out from the iron door.

With its crimson eyes flashing, the being roared fiercely at the
Floating Island.

\[Daikan – Primordial Beast of Ice\] **Lv: ■■■**

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Ice

**Danger:** ■

**Psychology:** \[■■■■■■\]

Magic Beast of Ice – Daikan the Primordial.

An otherworldly magic beast that could exist anywhere, even transcending
death.

And the power that had lay dormant in me.

It was my minion.

I extended my right arm forward.

Lowering just my index finger, I pointed downwards, indicating the
Floating Island.

***“Destroy it all.”***

As I issued the command with a dry voice, a dark blue magic circle,
seemingly large enough to engulf even the Floating Island, traced a
trajectory toward it.

Daikan roared. It was a roar so loud that it shook both Heaven and
Earth.

With just that, this world completely took on the form of a glacial
zone.

An astronomical amount of mana swirled.

Daikan’s cold mana twinkled like a clear flash…

And turned into a majestic beam of blue light that engulfed the entire
area.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━.

A ferociously unrelenting cold descended.

It painted the entire landscape with the color of its mana.

The relentless dark blue cold showed no signs of abating and stretched
endlessly, reaching beyond the horizon.

There was no sound. Even time itself seemed to freeze for a moment.

Amidst the explosion of dazzlingly bright cold mana…

I quietly closed my eyes.

And what was reflected in my vision was the image of Dorothy, who smiled
brightly even while sacrificing her own life.

There were things in the world that one could not face with a sane mind.
Perhaps, for Dorothy, the desolate landscape of her hometown reflected
in her eyes was one of such things.

Therefore, Dorothy, struggling to dilute painful memories, managed to
smile bravely, ensuring that the color of her life did not fade even in
her dying moment.

The Key of Mysteries was about to disappear. In order to return, I
turned the key in the air.

\[Level Up!! Your level has───.\]

■

\* \* \*

\[Master, I am comi-!\]

Upon returning to the mortal world, they were high above the clouds.

Hilde was unsummoned before she could finish her sentence and the
protective barrier cast on Dorothy was completely dispelled.

The golem familiar, Eden, had already been unsummoned by Isaac in the
Nether.

Isaac began to fall towards the sea, unconscious.

“…!”

Dorothy, who had started to fall after Hilde disappeared, felt the
sensation of mana returning to her body. She was gradually recovering;
there was no doubt about it.

The painful sensations that had plagued her body were gone. She spread
her hands and realized that the black spots that had covered her entire
body had completely vanished.

She judged that she would wield mana no matter the cost. Her voice cried
out.

“President!”

Dorothy swirled inside the dense advection fog, made even thicker due to
Isaac’s chilling aura, before pouring out starlight mana.

*Chararararang────!!*

A wall of starlight mana wrapped around the surroundings.

Within it, Dorothy manipulated gravity to slow down both her and Isaac’s
descent.

Then, she held Isasac’s hand.

***She pulled him.***

***She embraced him.***

Dorothy was clearly in a daze. After all, she couldn’t comprehend what
had happened, her mind was unable to keep up.

“…Senior.”

By then, Isaac had regained his sense. No, maybe he had never lost them
in the first place.

When his voice rang in her ears, Dorothy flinched her head in surprise
and gently let him down from her embrace.

The two of them locked eyes for a while.

“Let’s go back.”

Isaac smiled brightly with a face that had become as innocent as a
puppy.

It was hard to believe that this was the same man who had ruthlessly
dealt with the Floating Island mere moments ago.

Because she hadn’t finished processing everything in her mind, Dorothy
couldn’t even think of responding with a smile of her own.

“President…”

She only looked towards him with a worry-filled gaze

“Ah, but can you move me secretly? I can’t seem to move now that the
tension is released…”

“…”

***How nonchalant of him.***

Dorothy couldn’t help but chuckle before bursting out in laughter.

Suddenly, memories of the times spent in the corner of the Butterfly
Garden flashed through her mind.

On spring days when flowers bloomed beautifully, she had memories of
meaningless chattering with Isaac.

On summer days when the leaves turned a vibrant green, she had memories
of going near Isaac, who was training his ice magic, and spending her
time with him.

On autumn days when red leaves fell, she had memories of giving advice
to Isaac, who was training in rock magic, or playfully teasing him.

On winter days when all the leaves had fallen and only branches
remained, she had memories of placing Isaac, who had overworked himself
to the point of fainting, on her knees to allow him to rest and recover.

Dorothy realized.

The seasons would come and go, and after a while, spring would return.

And on that spring day, this man would still be by her side

“…Senior?”

Dorothy felt a sense of disharmony with herself for being so sure about
such a possibility.

For some reason, tears welled up in her eyes.

Laughter flowed from her lips, as Dorothy let out a bright smile akin to
a flower in full bloom.

“Nihihi, just leave it to this Big Sis.”

The dazzling solar light illuminated Dorothy’s tears.

Holding Isac’s hands tightly, she let out a joyful laugh that sounded
pure and bright.

After all, right now in this moment, all the value and meaning of the
life that Dorothy had known until now was completely changed.

Chapter 112: Subjugation of the Floating Island Interlude (1)
=============================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island Interlude (1) ༻**

An Archwizard was recognized as an existence that had surpassed the mere
label of a Wizard.

Common sense was meaningless before them and they effortlessly performed
feats and miracles that were incomprehensible to the human mind.

Among them, those who had reached the pinnacle of their respective
element were called Elemental Kings.

Currently, there were only four individuals who could claim to have
risen to the title of Elemental King.

Elemental King of Fire, Fire Sovereign.

Elemental King of Water, Water Sovereign.

Elemental King of Wind, Wind Sovereign.

Elemental King of Lightning, Lightning Sovereign.

In the nation of lightning protected by purple storms, Zabrok. Throne
Room.

Sitting on a throne, a man with half of his purple hair slicked back
slowly opened his eyes.

Dressed in a black robe adorned with a combination of violet and gold.
The appearance of a young man with sharp features akin to a hawk.

His eyes, crackling purple lightning mana, were unusually bright even in
the darkness of the night.

Thunder Emperor, Jaul Dragoniac. Just previously, he had instinctively
felt a threatening mana.

It was a mana composed of a profoundly cold and intense chill.

“‘Jormungandr.”

Jaul’s summon.

The purple lightning magic condensed on his shoulders, forming a small
black figure surrounded by electric currents.

Jormungandr, a lightning snake magic beast with two pairs of eyes.
Although its actual size was massive, Jaul summoned it in a miniature
form that was no different from an ordinary snake.

At one point, the magic beast had battled for supremacy with Jaul before
it eventually ended in its defeat, thus becoming his familiar.

\[I felt it as well. This transcendental mana… It is the Primordial
Beast of Ice.\]

Jormungandr recognized Jaul’s intention and responded before he said
anything. As a familiar, it shared not only its Master’s thoughts, but
emotions as well.

After gaining certainty with Jormungandr’s response, Jaul stroked his
chin, lost in thought.

The Primordial Beast of Ice.

Its mana was on a level that even Jaul, the Elemental King of Lightning,
could not surpass. Even if it had emerged from the opposite side of this
world, Jaul would have still felt mana prickling at his skin.

This world was too inadequate to contain such a magic beast. Just the
appearance of it would instantly envelop its surroundings in an absolute
chill.

Although the magic beast’s mana from a moment ago was merely a faint
breeze against the skin…

In reality, it had actually crossed to another world and even weathered
its air.

\[However, it’s under someone’s control. It seems to already serve
another master.\]

***The Primordial Beast of Ice served another master, you say… Is that
even a plausible proposition?***

***Is it an existence that could even be controlled in the first
place?***

Although it was unbelievable, if it was true, the master must have
already surpassed the level of the original Ice Sovereign.

As such, this world was about to face a turning point.

The mana released by the Primordial Beast would surely have been felt by
the magic beast of ice capable of manipulating both Heaven and Earth.

Icebound Crocodile Tugaros.

Frost Spirit Merphil.

Glacial Bear Barbatoma.

Upon the fact that a master worthy of the Primordial Beast of Ice had
appeared, they too would try to serve this same being as their new
master.

And it was not very difficult to deduce who that person would be.

“Isaac…”

Isaac, a silver-blue-haired boy who was currently enrolled at Märchen
Academy.

A prominent candidate for the next Ice Sovereign. No, someone certain of
becoming the Ice Sovereign. There was no one else besides him.

The Ice Kingdom, where a bitter cold stormed about, was preparing to
welcome a new King.

Isaac was an existence that even the Frost Dragon Hilde bowed to. As
such, he would undoubtedly rise as the new King of the Ice Kingdom.

As a man who was served by the Primordial Beast of Ice, it was
unimaginable how powerful of a Sovereign he would become.

Suddenly, the mysterious presence hidden within Isaac’s essence came to
mind.

The monstrous being covered in countless eyeballs boasted a majesty that
could potentially devour the entire world.

Within Isaac, the Primordial Beast of Ice had probably recognized the
aura of the Ice Sovereign and that enigmatic monster. Perhaps with that,
it felt that Isaac was worthy to serve as its master.

“He seemed to have destroyed the Floating Island. Did he perhaps summon
the Primordial Beast in that process?”

News of the Floating Island reappearing above the Arkins Sea was already
known.

Initially, he thought that the Zelver Empire would handle it, as it had
appeared in their nation. However…

In the end, it seemed that the next Ice Sovereign had gotten rid of the
Floating Island instead.

\[The other Elemental Kings must have felt that mana as well. What are
you going to do, Jaul? I’m afraid that an Emergency Council will be
convened soon.\]

The other Elemental Kings. Each of them had reached the highest level of
their respective elements and could not be controlled by any law. As
such, their next actions were unknown territory to Jaul.

However, the mana of the Primordial Beast had spread by transcending
space itself.

Even if the other Elemental Kings had recognized the emergence of the
next Ice Sovereign,

they would not know that it was Isaac.

After all, even if they were Elemental Kings, they were not omniscient.

“…In my personal opinion, I do not dislike the next Ice Sovereign.”

Though, of course, as the Emperor of the Lightning Nation, it was
natural to be wary of Isaac.

The Isaac he had seen at Märchen Academy was a man of both integrity and
great strength. That left a favorable impression on Jaul.

The true nature of an individual could not be hidden from Jaul’s eyes.
This was regardless of their race.

Therefore, he harbored feelings close to goodwill towards Isaac, the
next Ice Sovereign.

“And he seems to have a reason to hide his identity. I don’t have any
intention of interfering with his will.”

\[Are you planning to be evasive?\]

“At least for now. In the first place, trying to hide that power until
the end is like trying to cover the sky with one palm.”

Isaac probably had a reason to infiltrate the academy and conceal his
identity.

Isn’t he dealing with unidentifiable demons while under the guise of the
‘Black Monster’?

However, no matter how much he tried to hide the maximum threshold of
his mana, within the confined space of the academy, he wouldn’t be able
to conceal such tremendous power until the end.

As such, when the time came for Isaac to reveal his identity at Märchen
Academy…

…Only then would Jaul reveal the fact that Isaac was the Ice Sovereign
to the other Elemental Kings.

After all, that was the way to properly respect and protect the
intentions of the next Ice Sovereign.

“Perhaps soon, we will welcome a new Elemental King.”

It wouldn’t take long for such a future, where Isaac joined the Council
of Kings as the Ice Sovereign, to come.

Meanwhile…

All the staff, students, and Imperial Knights at Märchen Academy were
astonished.

After the Floating Island disappeared, its minions that had been
attacking the academy melted away, turning into ashes before vanishing.

And shortly after, pillars of starlight mana shot beneath the clouds and
plunged into the sea.

In succession, various colors of starlight mana dispelled the advection
fog, as it exploded in the sky, creating numerous clusters of stars. It
looked like a moment from a festival, truly a scene reminiscent of
fireworks.

The spectacle was beautiful to the point of rousing an eruption of
admiration. It was undoubtedly the mana of Dorothy Heartnova.

Although people found it difficult to comprehend the current situation,
one thing was perfectly clear.

“The Floating Island…?”

“W-we won… We won! We actually won!!”

Someone had defeated the Floating Island.

This starlight parade was Dorothy’s way of announcing to the Empire that
humanity had won!

Cheers resounded throughout Märchen Academy.

Even the citizens of the Zelver Empire, which spanned the Arkins Sea,
erupted in joy upon learning that the Floating Island had been defeated.

“…”

A cliff facing the Arkins Sea.

Luce Eltania silently observed the starlight festival erupting above the
sea.

After the Floating Island had transformed, it emitted a mana that made
even Luce tremble. Even Dorothy, who was considered to be Märchen
Academy’s greatest power house, would not be a match for it.

Therefore, the one who defeated the Floating Island narrowed down to one
person.

The Black Monster. He must be there.

The reason why Dorothy poured out starlight mana to create a shining
pillar was not because she wished to reveal the fact that they had won.

Rather, it probably had the purpose of blinding everyone from the truth.

It would make perfect sense if it was for the sake of obscuring the
identity of the Black Monster.

“…Huh?”

However, Luce was taken aback because of a sight that differed from her
expectations.

As the starlight parade ended, nothing was visible in her eyes.

She had been certain that Dorothy and the Black Monster would be inside
the starlight pillar. However, her predictions were completely off.

The cluster of stars dimmed and the sea darkened. Because of this, Luce
could not properly distinguish anything.

Luce furrowed her brows.

Did Dorothy distract everyone with that dazzling starlight festival and
sneak away above the clouds with the Black Monster?

Or perhaps…

“…I probably won’t be able to confirm anything.”

Luce sighed and turned her gaze sideways.

In the first place, her hypothesis that Dorothy had made the starlight
pillar to hide the Black Monster had little to no evidence.

“Isaac…”

Now that there was no need to repel the Floating Island’s attack, she
had to go find Isaac again, whom she had been searching for hours.

After all, just imagining him injured caused a piercing pain in her
chest.

While praying that Isaac was unharmed, Luce turned around and began
moving once again.

\* \* \*

Deep into the night.

From the scent of the grass, I sensed that I had arrived somewhere in
Josena Forest, near the main gate of Märchen Academy.

Dorothy had reached the hideout where we had hung out before. I could
feel it from the texture of the outer wall.

We sat side by side, leaning against the outer wall of the hideout, as
we quietly spent time listening to the sound of crickets.

My magically disguised outfit, which was now completely ragged, had been
taken off by Dorothy and placed in my magic pocket.

While asking, “It’s cold, right?”, she brought out the uniform shawl and
put it on me.

Shortly after, Dorothy used her remaining mana to cast healing magic on
me, but it was only at the level of basic first aid. I couldn’t move my
body no matter how hard I tried…

As such, I decided to wait here until I could somewhat move my body, and
until the situation outside had calmed down.

And so, I raised my head, gazing in the direction of the sky.

“…”

…This was the first time that such an awkward silence permeated the air
despite being with Dorothy.

***Is she in a daze because she expected to die, but was actually
saved?***

***Or is it because I, who had only been a weakling to her, had
destroyed the Floating Island, thus showing a different side than
usual?***

‘Either way, it’s understandable.’

A weakling like Isaac saving her, who faced imminent death, and even
annihilating that vast demon landmass with prowess at the level of an
Archwizard?

If I was Dorothy, I would need quite a bit of time to collect my
thoughts because such a scenario was utterly absurd.

“President.”

Finally, Dorothy broke the silence.

“How did you know I was going to die?”

***That’s…***

…Certainly a question she would be curious about.

I had already openly revealed the fact that I was the Black Monster. I
could hardly say, ‘Because I know the scenario of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱’, so I decided to respond evasively.

“Did you think I wouldn’t notice the curse that was hanging over you,
Senior?”

“…So that’s how it was. You’re much stronger than me, so I guess it was
obvious to you.”

No matter how I looked at it, Dorothy was overwhelmingly stronger than
me, but I decided to just ignore it and move on.

“President.”

Following her first words, Dorothy immediately bombarded me with a
series of questions.

“Why were you worried about me?”

“Huh?”

“I actually have the ability to read emotions. President has always been
worried about me. Why was that?”

“Well, you know… I’m Senior’s fan. If I knew there was a curse, how
could I not worry?”

“Then why did you always dote on me? Was that also because you’re my
fan?”

“Of course.”

I smiled, intentionally making it as bright as possible.

The side effect of using \[Ice Sovereign\] beyond its limits was coupled
with the reaction that came with the complete depletion of my mana.

As such, since a while ago, I had been experiencing intense pain; it was
as if my entire body was being pricked by thorns and I was so dizzy that
my head felt like it was about to split open. Such a smile was a facade
to conceal the abysmal condition of my body.

Well, the pain was gradually subsiding. It was probably also because I
was gradually losing the ability to feel my body.

Since returning from the Nether, I couldn’t see in front of me and even
the sensation of the hard outer wall against my back was fading away.

It felt like I was sinking into the deep, dark sea.

However, knowing that Dorothy by my side, still alive, filled me with a
sense of accomplishment. As such, I couldn’t help but continue my
conversation with her.

The symptoms had appeared because I had pushed myself too hard anyway.
Surely, they would gradually improve.

“…Why is the President a fan of mine?”

“Because Senior is cool. To me, you were a person that shined incredibly
bright.”

I loved how Dorothy’s eyes became cresent moons when she smiled.

I loved it when she smiled, revealing her white teeth.

When her earring swayed as she turned her head or when she giggled over
trivial matters.

When she praised herself and acted so confidently.

When she laughed and played pranks.

I even loved the way her brain seemed to shut down upon the slightest
hint of thinking.

Every side of her looked incredibly radiant to me.

“I see…”

Gradually, something covered my head. With my faint hearing, I could
tell that it was fabric brushing against me.

Even though the sensation in my head had completely disappeared, it
wasn’t difficult to guess what it was. It was definitely Dorothy’s hat.

I did not know why she put her hat on my head.

“…Isaac.”

And right in front of me, I could hear Dorothy’s gentle voice.

Considering her usual tone, it seemed oddly tinged with embarrassment.

Judging by the sound, Dorothy seemed to be holding the brim of the hat
on both sides and pulling it down.

“Close your eyes.”

Soon, something pressed against my lips.

And with that, our time flowed serenely for a while.

Chapter 113: Subjugation of the Floating Island - Interlude (2)
===============================================================

**༺ Subjugation of the Floating Island – Interlude (2) ༻**

Dorothy Gale crossed a field filled with white reeds.

The golden sunlight gently enveloped her skin.

The cluster of reeds swayed softly with every breeze.

The reason why the young girl could confidently traverse this field of
reed, even as it obscured her sight, was because there was a rainbow in
the sky.

Somewhere, over that rainbow.

There was a place she had heard about in a lullaby.

Because she believed that her maternal aunt, uncle, Toto, and the people
of the rural village that Dorothy had once lived in were all beyond that
rainbow, the young girl ran without rest towards it.

Passing through the field of reeds, Dorothy finally reached the world
beyond the rainbow, where there was a small red board-framed house.

As she was embraced in the arms of her aunt, she wore a bright smile.

At the end of such a scene, Dorothy faced her final moments, taking the
Floating Island as her companion to the afterlife, leaving nothing but
ashes.

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ episode 2, 「Back Story – Wizard of Oz」.

There was nothing left for Dorothy.

Thus, she prepared herself for an inevitable end even as she lived on.

She rid herself of any lingering attachments…

***…And then, Isaac appeared.***

***He burdened Dorothy with many lingering attachments.***

***He caused her to take out the teddy bear hidden in the wardrobe of
her dorm.***

***He caused her to engrave the places she wanted to go and the things
she wanted to do in her heart.***

***He shattered her resolve to give up on everything and let go.***

***But most importantly of all… he promised to save her.***

He found her and asked her to return.

Dorthy pulled away from Isaac’s lips, slipping out from under the witch
hat she had put on him.

He was already unconscious.

It was easy to notice that he was only pretending to be alright. He had
pushed himself too hard, so it was only natural that he was hurting.

As she saw his unfocused eyes, Dorthy realized that Isaac couldn’t see
in front of him.

And since he was forcibly opening his eyes, trying to keep conscious,
she had told him to close his eyes as a sign that it was time for rest.

Because he had already pushed himself to the limit, he fell asleep as
soon as his eyes closed.

Isaac’s body was robust. Moreover, the transcendental ice mana flowing
in his veins had been steadily reinforcing his mana circuit since a
while ago.

After a deep rest, he would wake back up in a healthy state.

He truly was a monster of a man.

While gazing at Isaac, Dorothy let out a faint smile.

Dorothy had the ability to read people’s emotions.

She always saw emotions of affection whenever Isaac looked at her. It
had a similar form to the emotions she had always seen from her aunt,
uncle, and Toto.

─‘Do you like me, President?’

She had tried testing those emotions on several occasions. In fact, she
often made tasteless jokes

However, Isaac always remained the same. Without change, he continued to
cherish Dorothy, worry for her, and harbor affection for her.

A heart filled with pure sincerity that never had any selfish motives
behind it.

The buzzing of bugs could not be heard at all.

Only a rapid and rhythmic heartbeat echoed inside Dorothy’s ears.

“Goodnight, Isaac.”

Dorothy smiled softly, leaning Isaac comfortably against the wall…

And quietly closed her eyes as she leaned her head on his shoulder.

First snow began to fall.

Gradually, the winter night deepened.

Morning. Butterfly garden. The butterfly garden sparkled as the snow
that fell during the night piled softly.

I was quietly organizing my thoughts as I went on my morning jogging.

The situation had been resolved.

Despite the appearance of the Floating Island, the academy hadn’t
suffered any major damage and the most severe injuries were only minor.

A huge part of such a result was due to Luce’s intervention.

***I’m so proud of that kid.***

Last night, I ascended high above the clouds with Dorothy after falling
into the sea. After all, I couldn’t afford to be noticed.

As such, we decided to take a rest at the hideout within Josena Forest.

And I had lost all my bodily functions before falling into a deep
slumber.

My memories were fuzzy, as if I had blacked out after drinking copious
amounts of alcohol.

Dorothy’s hat was on my head and I had a vague memory of my head leaning
back.

With that, I passed out almost immediately after closing my eyes…

However, you know… Uh given the circumstances, I couldn’t help but
seriously ask myself.

*‘Did we kiss?’*

***Me… and Dorothy?***

When I couldn’t feel anything? When I was no different from some stone
grandpa?

***How can I accept such a thing? I can never…!***

***It’s so unfair if I got my favorite character’s first kiss but I
couldn’t even feel it…***

‘…Well, I was probably overreacting.’

Whatever. I shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Yesterday, I was in an
absolutely fucked up state, so it could all be speculation.

I could find and ask Dorothy later, ‘Did we happen to kiss?’

‘No, wait… If I just suddenly ask her like that…’

‘It might make me look easy.’

***…Let’s just ask later when the time is right.***

Anyway.

After resting at the hideout, I regained my senses. Perhaps Dorothy had
healed my body little by little as her mana recovered.

After I could move my body to a certain extent, I joined the academy
shelter at dawn. Of course, I went separately from Dorothy.

At the shelter, there were many students gathered after all.

Since there were many injured people due to the minions of the Floating
Island, I could blend in without attracting attention with my physical
condition.

After all, externally, I was just a first-year Class C student in the
Magic Department.

As soon as I entered the shelter, Luce found me with her monstrous
eyesight, as she ran up and hugged me. She also used her seductive voice
to torment my ears, whispering how worried she had been.

My legs were already shaking, but because of her voice, they lost all
strength. My whole body felt like it was going to melt.

The academy staff announced that they would start investigating who
dealt with the Floating Island and whether it was definitively defeated.

Of course, from my perspective, I just hoped for the investigation to
end without any problems.

Putting that aside though…

After a nice deep slumber, my condition had recovered and my body felt
relatively fine.

I expected the aftereffects to last quite a while, so I didn’t expect
for me to recover so quickly

***Maybe it’s because I ceaselessly trained my body.***

‘No…’

Although it could’ve had some influence, the most significant effect
seemed to be from briefly dipping my toes into the full power of \[Ice
Sovereign\] while fighting the Floating Island.

Since then, I felt a change in my body. How should I put this… The mana
itself was depleted, but the mana circuit seemed to have become more
robust.

‘Not only that…’

Looking at the status window, I couldn’t help but smile.

Just defeating the Floating Island increased my level by a whopping 10.
In total, it had gained 16 levels in just one night.

‘What a dogshit game…’

This was the hell difficulty of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Because it was set to hell difficulty, the enemies that appeared were
stronger, but the experience gained was not much different from other
difficulties.

However, even with such limitations, I explosively leveled up after
defeating the Floating Island. In essence, it could be considered an
incredible result.

And now, I was in a state of mana depletion. As mentioned before, once
mana was depleted until it hit rock bottom, the mana recovery rate
slowed down to an abysmal rate until it fully recovered.

Therefore, since it would take quite some time for my mana to fully
recover, I needed to refrain from magic training for a while. Well, in
the first place, any magic training was challenging in my current
situation.

As such, I decided to take this opportunity to recharge as much as
possible.

‘Of course, I can’t just rest.’

It wasn’t long before the end-of-semester evaluation for the second
semester of the first year began.

My goal was to receive the ‘Self-Development Excellence’ scholarship
given to the student with the largest increase in grades compared to the
previous semester. With that, I could face the first semester of the
second year without worrying about tuition fees.

Basically, I couldn’t just take it easy for the end-of-semester
evaluation.

‘Also, preparing for exams can also help me get stronger.’

Knowledge played a significant role in learning new magic or developing
magic skills. In other words, studying itself would become a stepping
stone to becoming stronger.

I hoped that my mana would fully recover by the end-of-semester
evaluation.

And I had finally obtained the unique trait I wanted: \[Ultra Magic
Knight\].

Except, this Unique Trait was effective only when I became a second-year
student, so it was currently in a sealed state. How regrettable.

The effect of \[Ultra Magic Knight\] was to apply the effect of the
Unique Trait \[Weapon Master\], which rapidly increased the proficiency
of magic weapons, to ultimate elemental weapons.

It also enhanced the power of magic as much as the trained physical
abilities. As such, it was truly a dramatic talent for a Magic Knight.

Moreover, my current state was trained extensively, compared to when I
fought against the ‘Hello’ demon, Trevion the Evil.

If I reached Level 120 in the future, it was clear that my mana would be
even higher than when \[Hunter\] had first activated.

‘I’m diligently leveling up.’

***How satisfying.***

Now that I had surpassed Level 100, \[Hunter\] would activate at a fixed
level of 200.

Level 200 was also the qualification needed to achieve EX-Grade stats.

Therefore, in order for me to defeat the Evil God, my next long-term
goal was to obtain EX-Grade stats.

During the winter vacation, I had to obtain the rock ultimate weapon,
‘Gormos’ Greatsword’, and prepare to pound the Pillar Demons, also known
as the Tower of Demons.

If I raised Potential \[Learning Efficiency\] to S-Grade as well, I
should also allocate stats to \[vs. Race Combat Power\].

‘After all, I must prepare for the Alice Subjugation when I enter the
second year.’

Alice Carroll. Boss Name: Queen of Hearts-Alice.

Alice was shrouded in more mystery than any other character.

How did she end up supporting the Evil God? How did she recognize that
the Evil God was resurrecting in the first place? How did she find out
that she shouldn’t mess with Ian Fairytale’s household?

All these questions remained hidden behind her kind smile even until the
very end of the game.

Although the identity of Alice was a subject of intense curiosity in the
game community, there was no official answer from the company in the
end.

As such, users naturally engaged in discussions on Alice’s identity in
the community whenever there was a chance.

‘Alice is a modern person that possessed a character in the game’,
‘Alice is a regressor who can go back to the past. That’s why she knows
everything, ‘Alice only found out everything with her mysterious
abilities and she just concocted the destruction of the world because of
her, similar to Luce, human-hating ideology’, ‘Alice is just
KAWAIIIIIIIIIIIIII\~’, and so on and so forth.

Of course, in the end, it was an inconclusive and meaningless debate.

Personally, I leaned toward the idea that Alice was a regressor.

‘After all, usually for these things, it was a common cliche that they
were actually regressors.’

Alice repeated countless regressions until her mind broke and she
somehow started dreaming of the world’s destruction… This was the story
I had imagined.

However, now that I was here, it didn’t seem like that at all.

If Alice was really a regressor, she would have quickly noticed the
differences from the previous rounds and would have come to deal with me
already. My attempts to hide my identity would have been utterly
meaningless.

Therefore, Alice was a character with a lot of uncertainty.

All I could do was lay as low as possible until Alice revealed her true
self and was subjugated.

***Well… Whatever. Let’s put aside useless fantasies that don’t have an
answer to anyway.***

Alice was a Dorothy Victim so I should be able to safely overcome the
Alice Subjugation Battle.

‘Probably.’

Of course, things rarely went according to my plans. How troublesome…

‘Anyway, putting that aside…’

Primordial Beast-Diakan.

I never imagined this little bastard was hiding inside of me.

Currently, I couldn’t feel anything and my insides were so calm that it
actually made me even more uneasy.

In my current state where \[Hunter\] was inactive, I couldn’t even sense
that this guy was inside me.

I probably had to activate \[Hunter\] and also use the power of \[Ice
Sovereign\] in order to properly control him. For now, he was
undoubtedly my minion after all.

For reference, familiars and minions were strictly different.

A familiar was a close relationship formed by a pact with the master.
Mana sharing and emotion sharing were possible and if the master’s skill
could keep up, then it was even possible to summon it by reducing its
size. Moreover, one person could only have up to three familiars.

On the other hand, minions didn’t have any of that. After summoning it,
there was nothing else that came with it. There was also no limit to how
many one could own. It was just a matter of who obeyed whom.

Because I summoned the Primordial Beast, I had probably scraped the
bottom of my mana reserves. After all, I couldn’t even summon Eden, who
was usually easy peasy to do ssssso…

“President”

“Whoa!”

***Oh shit. That scared the crap outta me…!***

When I ran past a tree, a female student suddenly popped out, as if she
was lying in ambush.

I stopped in my tracks and turned to look in the direction of the female
student who had been hiding behind the tree.

It seemed like my reaction was funny as she was giggling, ‘Nihihi’.

“Senior?”

A female student with long light purple hair tied only at the end.

It was Dorothy Hearnova.

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Lv:** 182

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Rock, Starlight

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆\]

Last night, Dorothy’s mana was almost depleted, so \[Psychological
Insight\] had worked briefly.

It seemed that she had recovered a considerable amount of mana
overnight. After all, due to her starlight mana, \[Psychological
Insight\] was blocked once again.

It was a bit disappointing that I couldn’t read her psychology though…

“As expected of a training manic, are you training even in these wee
hours? Did you forget that you pushed yourself really hard yesterday?
President, it’ll hurt my heart if you overexert yourself again, you
know?”

Dorothy made a jokingly sorrowful expression as she placed her hand on
her chest. The corners of her mouth were lifted.

“It’s just exercise. Senior, you’re here so early in the morning.”

“Oh, well. It’s just that the morning air was so refreshing! I also
happened to see the President, so I thought I should come say hello. So,
um…”

Dorothy had a subtle blush on her cheek. Was she trying to say something
embarrassing?

I turned my body completely towards Dorothy and silently waited for her
to say what she wanted.

Dorothy rubbed the brim of her witch hat a few times before finally
making eye contact. And with that…

*“…Good morning, Isaac.”*

All she did was call my name and give me a simple morning greeting.

Come to think of it, today was the tomorrow that Dorothy could never
reach in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. It was the first morning she had
faced as a completely free person.

As if nothing had happened, she stood before me, and…

It didn’t feel real that I had actually saved Dorothy.

This situation… This greeting just felt natural and predetermined, as if
it was always meant to be.

“Yes, Senior. Good morning.”

So, I smiled and returned her greeting as if it were the most simple and
natural thing in the world.

Dorothy let out a dazzling smile.

The trees were adorned with white snowflakes.

As we casually bantered, we slowly walked along this white path lined
with trees.

Chapter 114: End of the Second Semester
=======================================

**༺ End of the Second Semester (1) ༻**

Since returning to Märchen Academy, a series of unbelievable events had
unfolded before Eve.

Recently, there was a tremendous incident that almost led to the
destruction of a chunk of the Empire, including Märchen Academy.

After a brief break where the situation stabilized, the academy resumed
classes.

Magic Department, Orphin Hall. Second year Classroom.

Eve Ropenheim, a girl with silver-blue hair tied to the side, was
tapping the desk with her fingers, lost in thought.

When she turned her head to look out the window, suddenly, the massive
island floating in the sky came to her mind.

The despair she felt when she realized it was the Floating Island was
utterly indescribable.

“…”

And Eve remembered the horrifying clash that occurred on the Floating
Island.

The Black Monster. It achieved victory in its battle against the
Floating Island.

And Märchen Academy, its people, and her younger brother Isaac were all
safe thanks to it.

Eve’s fingers, who had been tapping the desk, suddenly stopped.

She had seen Isaac’s proficient magic skills in the joint practical
evaluation.

Outstanding physical abilities.

Ice Element.

And…

─‘I can’t accept that you attacked me out of nowhere and tried to take
Sir Isaac away from me.’

Those aggressive words were spoken by Kaya Astrea, the second seat of
the Magic Department freshman.

“Sir, Isaac…”

Eve muttered to herself.

When she first met Kaya, she was not in her right mind due to her fear,
but…

After regaining her rationality, she continuously felt that something
was very out of place.

A student who was a second seat in Märchen Academy’s Magic Department
respectfully called her brother, ‘Sir Isaac’…

“…No way.”

As Eve entertained absurd thoughts, she quickly shook her head.

…There was no way that Isaac could be the Black Monster.

The Black Monster was an Archwizard. A monster among monsters.

Even if a guy like Isaac, who had no magic talent, worked himself to
death, he could never reach the level of the Black Monster.

After all, she had spent so much time with him for it to be true.

As his older sister who spent her childhood with Isaac, she could vouch
that he wasn’t the Black Monster.

As the professor entered the classroom, she cleared her mind.

Eve tore her gaze away from the window and threw her thoughts aside
before returning to reality.

\* \* \*

Recently, my time exercising had suddenly increased.

It was because magic training was excluded from my daily routine. After
all, I was currently in a state of mana depletion.

My condition was at its peak every day and my sleep had become
incredibly comfortable.

I now realized how strenuous my magic training used to be and the amount
of fatigue it imposed on me.

Although it seemed perfect in this time of readjustment…

‘I really can’t get used to this.’

Creating simple ice or rock constructs used to be as easy as riding a
bike whenever I was bored.

Fatigue was like some passive skill that always accompanied me.

***So, how did it feel to have my body so refreshed while unable to use
magic, you ask?***

It didn’t even feel like my own body.

After finishing classes, I was walking underneath the afternoon
sunlight.

If I glanced around, it seemed like nothing had happened and time at
Märchen Academy was flowing peacefully.

‘The break due to the Floating Island only lasted for three days as
well.’

After a three-day break, classes resumed.

Today marked the beginning of the third week since I had defeated the
Floating Island.

The aftermath of the Floating Island incident was still being pitifully
handled by the academy staff.

Well, absolute chaos had erupted.

‘The Floating Island got utterly annihilated after all.’

The Fortress of the Heavens, the Harbinger of Destruction, Paradise and
Hell.

The Floating Island was first on the Zelver Empire’s subjugation list.

A mysterious and gigantic island with unimagine power suddenly appeared
in the heavens, turning the entire area into a wasteland.

The human and property damage caused by the Floating Island throughout
history exceeded any imaginable scale.

However, in one night, the enormous entity disappeared without a trace
and despite the Empire quickly organizing a subjugation force, they
couldn’t reach the Floating Island to defeat it.

Throughout history, humanity had suffered from the Floating Island, but…

The unknown creature that resided in Märchen Academy, the Black Monster,
had eradicated it. And he had done so all on his own.

‘That conclusion was reached by the academy based on the circumstances
of the incident and Dorothy’s testimony.’

The news had spread worldwide.

The Black Monster, who defended the Empire by destroying the Floating
Island, began to be revered as an ‘unnamed hero’ because of the most
recent incident as well as its previous exploits.

After all, forget the academy, it had realistically saved humanity
itself.

‘The results were beyond expectation.’

I couldn’t keep hiding the fact that I was the Black Monster forever.

As such, I had the intention to show a stance that the Black Monster was
undoubtedly on the side of Märchen Academy in advance… The groundwork
for that was laid out very well.

However, I could see how much the academy staff, including the
Headmistress, were struggling. After all, the emergence of demons was
already a headache, but now, they also had to deal with the attention of
the entire world focused on them due to the Black Monster.

Unfortunately, spring wouldn’t find them until the Evil God was
defeated.

It wouldn’t have been strange for the academy to shut down due to these
continuous series of events. However, as expected, the academy was still
relentlessly rolling forward, adhering to its ideology of guaranteeing
educational opportunities for its students no matter what.

‘Of course, that’s just a secondary issue.’

***Screw ideology.*** In the first place, Märchen Academy was in a
situation where they couldn’t close even if they wanted to.

As I mentioned before…

‘Influential figures from all over the world are paying attention to
this place.’

Emperor Carlos of the Zelver Empire was blatantly supporting Märchen
Academy.

And the Helize Church was also keeping an eye on Märchen Academy.

The Pope of the Helize Church was recognized as a secular authority and
the territory he governed was classified as an independent Holy Land.

He held a position that could only be compared to Emperor Carlos within
the Empire. After all, even an emperor could not stand above the realm
of God.

Moreover, the eastern country, ‘Horan, Land of the Fire Blossoms’, with
national power comparable to the Zelver Empire, was also paying
attention to this place.

Next year, the Princess of the Imperial Family, the Saintess from the
Church, and the Shrine Maidenx from the eastern country were all
planning to enroll at Märchen Academy, so…

The higher-ups at the academy had no choice but to continue running the
school.

In the end…

Under the protection of the Emperor, they would plan to ensure the
safety of the students as much as possible and just roll with it no
matter how they did so.

In the first place, all the students desired the elite education and
diploma of Märchen Academy, so everyone’s interests were aligned.

I silently expressed my condolences to the center of the academy’s
administration, Bartos Hall.

‘Well then, now…’

***Time to grind.***

Classes were over and there was not much time left until the written
exams after all.

I headed to the library.

Märchen Academy’s library was quite large in scale. There were always
available seats, even during exam periods, so I didn’t have to worry
about seat availability.

I took a seat and placed five books on the table. Since I had already
read these books three times each, I could quickly review them.

After taking a deep breath, I recalled my days of studying for the state
examination as I immersed myself in the contents of the book.

\* \* \*

‘That person… He’s here again.’

Although Märchen Academy’s library was quite large, it seemed like the
silver-blue-haired male student always caught the eyes of the female
student who worked as a librarian.

He had been visiting the library every day as the exam period
approached.

These days, he would study until late at night with frightening
concentration, only leaving the library when the librarian announced it
was closing time.

Sitting at the librarian’s desk, the female student rested her chin on
her hand, staring intently at the silver-blue-haired male student. It
was inevitable that attention would be drawn to him.

Magic Department freshman, Isaac. Among the freshmen, he was known as a
commoner with Grade E mana. He was the very definition of the weakest
among the weak.

However, he silently and steadfastly honed his skills, showing
tremendous growth despite the condescending gazes around him.

Now, it wouldn’t be wrong to say he was on par with Class B students, if
not surpassing them. The gazes of the students towards Isaac were
gradually turning into one of admiration and respect.

Since he was someone who used to be looked down upon because he was a
commoner with Grade E mana, the change in perception was even more
dramatic for the female student working at the library.

‘So cool…’

A subtle blush appeared on both her cheeks.

Love often came unexpectedly, especially among students.

The young man known as Isaac was arousing the interest of the student
librarian.

“…!”

However, as feelings of yearning began to surface, the female
librarian’s breath suddenly caught, almost choking her.

It was because it felt as if a giant shark was staring at her from the
depths of the ocean.

An eerie sensation of an unknown origin. Her survival instinct was
terrifyingly warning her not to like that man.

And suddenly…

A pretty female student with rose-gold hair that flowed out appeared
behind Isaac.

“Ta-daa, Luce is here.”

She bent her upper body and swiftly slid in beside Isaac without
hesitation.

Despite her mischievousness, her seductive tone made it seem like the
air itself was swaying.

Even the students around, who were supposed to be studying, couldn’t
help but sneak glances at the girl with rose-gold hair.

After all, she boasted such a beautiful appearance that anyone could
briefly lose their mind at the sight of her.

Luce Eltania. She was the unrivaled top seat out of the Magic Department
freshman.

“Ah, Luce.”

Isaac turned his head, looking at Luce who was leaning onto his shoulder
beside him.

Close distance. Luce smiled brightly, making eye contact with Isaac.

To anyone watching, they looked no different from a couple.

Nearby, the hands of the male students holding books began to tremble.

Although there were already several couples studying together, Isaac, in
particular, evoked strong jealousy and envy among the surrounding
students.

“Isaac, let’s study together.”

“I don’t mind.

Ah, Luce. Did you understand this part? I’ve read this book four times
but I still don’t get it.”

“Oh yeah. I know. It made sense after I memorized everything up to
Intermediate Theory.”

“…Your brain is a cheat.”

Isaac glared at Luce with envious eyes.

After exchanging a few words, the two sat side by side and began
studying together.

While Isaac passionately studied, silently lip-syncing the contents of
the book…

Luce, on the other hand, casually flipped through the pages with the
elegance of a swan.

Luce could memorize and recall anything after only seeing it once
anyway.

It was just that she was deliberately reading the book at a slower pace
to match Isaac’s studying speed.

‘Too much…’

The student librarian smacked her lips before turning her head again.

It felt like the wall protecting Isaac was way too high to harbor any
affection for him.

“…”

At that moment, Luce glanced at the female student librarian.

And then resumed reading the book expressionlessly.

“Isaac.”

“Hmm?”

“Let’s be together all day today. Suddenly, I really feel like studying
a lot.”

“We only have 4 days left until the written exam and you’re talking
about wanting to study a lot now…?”

To Isaac, who felt like he was dying from studying, Luce’s brain was
enviable.

Luce playfully tickled the back of Isaac’s hand with a pen. Then, after
briefly teasing him, she went back to reading her book.

The last exam of the second semester; the end-of-semester evaluation was
not far off now.

Chapter 115: End of the Second Semester (2)
===========================================

**༺ End of the Second Semester (2) ༻**

“From now on, we will begin the end-of-semester comprehensive practical
evaluation for the second semester of the first year for the Magic
Department. The duel evaluation.”

Dueling grounds.

The first-year students of the Magic Department had filled the spectator
stands.

Since the academy had divided the first-year students into four groups,
each group would be taking the exam in a different location.

In the center of the arena, exam proctors and judges stood in an orderly
fashion.

The host for the exam was the handsome silver-haired professor, Fernando
Frost. As he held the speaker and announced in a sweet voice, female
students sighed and moaned with faces filled with infatuation.

Before they knew it, it was time for the end-of-semester practical exam
that would conclude the second semester.

Three exams would be conducted over three days.

The first exam was magic craftsmanship, the second was breaking mana
barriers, and…

The third and final exam was dueling.

The scale was inevitably smaller than the first semester.

Due to the attack of the Floating Island, some parts of the ground split
open and buildings collapsed. Unfortunately, these infrastructure
damages occurred at the key location where the end-of-semester
evaluation was being prepared.

It was the same in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ as well. When seeing that
the scenario was unchanged from its original form, it seemed that the
damaged buildings and areas were particularly weak in terms of their
foundation.

‘Anyway.’

Thanks to investing time in studying instead of magic training, I was
able to achieve fairly good grades in the written exam.

Now, if I managed to conclude the remaining practical exams on a good
note, I would definitely be able to secure the ‘Self-Development
Excellence’ scholarship.

‘Fortunately, a significant amount of my mana has also returned.’

My mana recovery speed had also increased.

It was evident that I had crossed a certain threshold, thus being able
to free myself from my mana depletion state.

It was such a relief that it recovered just before the end-of-semester
evaluation. It truly was fortunate.

Soon after, Professor Fernando explained the rules for the duel
evaluation.

It was similar to the first semester. However, there were two
differences.

Firstly, there was no immediate feedback. I wasn’t particularly
interested in that anyway.

Secondly, the academy had personally chosen the opponents for the duel.

It was to correctly balance the matches of the end-of-semester
evaluation. As such, no one knew who their opponent would be until they
were called forth.

However, they would’ve matched students with the most similar grades
based on the evaluations so far. The pairing brackets would have
probably been carefully organized, even considering the most minor
things.

‘I guess Luce and Kaya will duel against each other.’

It would be intensely competitive. I honestly couldn’t even fathom how
fierce the competition would be.

For reference, Class A would take the exam separately in a secluded
location; it was a vast field.

The academy had probably chosen this location considering their
outstanding capabilities.

Incidentally, the fifth seat, Keridna Whiteclark, would compete with the
top students of Class B.

Eventually, following Professor Fernando’s call, students went into the
arena to begin their duels.

As students with similar grades faced each other, a fierce battle
unfolded. It was quite a spectacle to watch.

***Putting that aside though…***

‘Most of these guys are weaker than me now.’

The more I felt the mana from the dueling students, the more I realized
that my mana had risen to the upper ranks among the Magic Department
freshmen.

Confidence began to bubble within me as I felt that even those who once
appeared threatening could now be easily defeated.

‘Ah, the good old days.’

I couldn’t believe I was still the same person who was once ridiculed
for having Grade E mana during the first semester.

Isaac Coin, once a loser, was now drawing an upward curve, just as
planned.

“Hey, friend!”

“Oh, hello.”

Suddenly, a lively female student with short white hair and a black
rabbit ear ribbon approached and sat next to me.

It was Amy Holloway, Ian Fairytale’s childhood friend and lover.

I thought about greeting her when I found the opportunity, but she came
over on her own.

“What about Ian?”

“He’s in a different group. But Isaac, why did you just pass by last
time without saying hello to me? Did you think I wouldn’t notice?”

“You looked depressed after the written exam so I thought you might have
royally screwed yourself. Didn’t you think your future was looking bleak
until recently?”

“…If you’re that perceptive, you won’t be popular, you know?”

***What does she want me to do then…***

“Anyway, a rainbow always comes after the rain.”

“Since the semester is almost over?”

“Of course\~. After today’s exam finishes, the second semester is over
and soon it’s the vacation ceremony. There’s no time to feel depressed!
Isaac, what are you going to do during the vacation?”

“I haven’t made any specific plans yet.”

Of course, that was a lie.

I was on a journey to defeat the Evil God. It was the most basic of the
basics to always have a specific plan.

Excluding training plans and demon hunting plans, there was something
that could be called a big event during winter vacation.

‘Gormos’ Greatsword.’

I planned to meet the mythical magic beast. ‘Stone Turtle – Gormos’ and
receive the Trial of Sandstone in order to obtain ‘Gormos’ Greatsword’.
It was the ultimate weapon of the rock element.

Of course, just like I did during the Trial of Frost, I would once again
have to put my life on the line this time.

It was just business as usual. I was determined to overcome the Trial of
Sandtone.

“Ha!”

Suddenly, an arrogant chuckle echoed from the front.

It was Tristan Humphrey, a vain blond noble who was sitting two rows
ahead of me.

His voice sounded like he had been eavesdropping on the conversation
between Amy and I before finding an opportunity to barge in.

Tristan smirked while sitting with his arms and legs crossed. He
slightly turned his head to the back, revealing the pearly whites of his
teeth.

“It’s almost winter vacation now but you haven’t even made specific
vacation plans! I’ve already meticulously and specifically drawn up my
special training plan that pursues the pinnacle of efficiency!”

“…”

“Watch and learn, you commoner! If you continue to remain absent-minded
as you are now, you won’t even reach my ankles!”

Tristan laughed with a ‘Keuhehehe’ before coughing as if he choked on
something.

‘I didn’t even ask him to teach me though…?’

***Why is he suddenly acting out?***

I didn’t know how to react, so I just ignored him.

“Next! Class B Jack Schneider, Class C Isaac! Come forward!”

The call of the referee.

***I guess it’s my turn.***

“I’ll head out first.”

“Yep, good luck\~.”

After receiving Amy’s encouragement, I left the stands and went up to
the arena.

Across from me, a male student with long bangs covering his right eye
came up.

A tall and agile physique. To put it badly, he looked like a pair of
chopsticks.

His laughter that went ‘Kikik’ complemented his annoying appearance; but
in a way, I was actually glad to see him.

“Kikik…! Hey, isn’t your luck with match-ups way too bad?”

Jack Schneider.

He was one of the top students in Class B who had blocked Ciel and I
during the end-of-semester evaluation of the first semester.

\[Jack Schneider\] **Lv:** 88

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Lightning, Wind

**Danger:** Low

**Psychology:** \[Looking down on you.\]

“I can’t believe some Class C bastard, no wait. I can’t believe the one
who was once famous for having Grade E mana is actually my opponent…!
Kikik…! Your luck is really baddd\~.”

‘Oh, motherfu-’

***I seriously can’t stand this little shit’s way of talking…***

Of course, just as he said, my match-up luck seemed to be quite poor on
the surface. Generally, the gap between Class C upper ranks and Class B
upper ranks was quite significant.

However, these match-ups were decided based on the grades shown during
the second semester.

In other words, even the academy judged that my skills were not inferior
to the upper ranks of Class B.

“Well, whatever. I guess it is.”

I replied nonchalantly, lightly rolling my shoulders and loosening up my
body.

“Still, don’t hold back.”

Even though it was an exam, what I needed was a measure of my combat
power.

My duel opponent, Jack Schneider, would perform this role excellently.

Jack started laughing once again. Well, It was actually closer to a
sneer.

“What’s with that relaxed attitude? You were no different from a bug
before! You were at the very bottom of the food chain! Do you think you
can be my opponent just because you had a slight improvement in skill?
What a delusional lunatic! Didn’t you win against an elite member of
Black Tiger because he let himself get hit? He was going easy on you!
Hey, you dumbass! How are you so stupid? Can you not even judge your own
skills when you’re this much weaker than meee\~? Unlike last semester’s
end-of-semester evaluation, the top seat isn’t here to protect you!”

‘You’re weak’, ‘You’re weak…’ I felt like my ears were bleeding because
of his annoying voice.

‘But still…’

At least within the Magic Department freshmen, there would no longer be
any retards who said such things to me after today.

“Any means allowed! Surrender is prohibited for one minute. Now, show
respect to your opponent and prepare for the duel. Ready, begin!”

*Dududududek───!*

「Ice Wall」

As the wall of ice rose from the ground, enclosing Jack Schneider, he
unleashed a strong thunderbolt, shattering it into pieces.

*Rumbleee───.*

*Kwang───!*

“Kikik…! Blocking my lightning with this level of ice is imp… ossib…?”

*Pukkk──!*

“Eheuk!”

\[Ice Wall\] was intentionally made weak so it could be destroyed.

As soon as the referee said ‘begin, I casted a weak \[Ice Wall\].

And at the same time, I kicked off the ground and rushed towards Jack in
an instant.

Speed, athletic ability.

‘I’m on an entirely different level compared to before.’

The me now was far stronger than when I dueled with Tristan in the first
semester.

I punched this little shit’s abdomen, the impact lifting his body off
the arena floor.

Instantaneously, I condensed ice mana into my right hand. The magic
circle of \[Frost Explosion\] was engraved into the air.

Now, there was no need for any preparatory movements to condense the
mana necessary for casting \[Frost Explosion\], nor did it require
several seconds to gather my mana in the first place.

A surprised Jack barely held onto his consciousness and quickly gathered
his lightning mana to deploy a magic circle for a counterattack.

However, I vigorously swung my right arm, detonating the condensed ice
mana.

*Kwaaaaaaah──────!!!*

A cold wind fiercely swirled like a storm.

The cold mana explosion spread, dealing a significant blow to his body.
The sheer force of the explosion dispersed the lightning mana.

The instantly formed frost created a large lump of ice, trapping him
inside.

As if time had stopped for him, his face remained contorted in pain
within the ice.

*Whoooooosh───.*

“Hoo.”

In the aftermath of \[Frost Explosion\], a misty cold air flowed from my
exhale.

There was no need to see more; the result of the match was clear. After
activating defrost, the lump of ice dissolved.

“Keugh…”

Pale blue mana scattered like flower petals and within it, Jack keeled
over before collapsing onto the arena.

His wide-open eyes were rolled back, showing only his white retinas. It
seemed like he had lost consciousness without even being able to close
his eyes.

The match ended in an instant. The referee extended his arm toward me
with a bewildered expression.

“Class C Isaac wins!”

I felt the abstruse gazes of the students. Even Amy had her mouth wide
open in surprise.

It was understandable.

After all, it was proven that I had at the very least reached the upper
ranks of Class B.

“I learned a thing or two.”

I hadn’t learned anything, but I politely said such a lie to the fallen
Jack before turning my back and descending from the arena.

“Hmm.”

***Huh, I’m kinda proud of myself for that.***

\* \* \*

“Jack Schneider lost…? To Isaac?”

“Isaac just overwhelmed him, right…?”

“Didn’t he have Grade E mana in the first semester?”

The students in the spectators’ stands murmured quietly, making sure
Isaac couldn’t hear.

Amy Holloway bombarded Isaac with questions on how he did that as soon
as he returned, expressing admiration and repeatedly exclaiming, “You’re
amazing, Isaac!” with a wide smile.

“…”

Tristan Humphrey’s widened eyes showed no signs of narrowing.

He had already known that Isaac’s physical abilities were exceptional.

However, just a while ago, the athletic ability that Isaac had
displayed… was on a completely different level compared to when Tristan
had dueled with him in the first semester.

Moreover, Jack Schneider wasn’t just one-sidedly taking a beating from
Isaac.

He tried to counterattack and lightning mana had clearly been gathered.

He actually handled it quite quickly.

This implied that there was a contest of strength between their magic.

However, Jack’s lightning mana was powerlessly devoured by Isaac’s ice
mana.

That meant that Isaac had undoubtedly overwhelmed Jack in every aspect.

‘How can… that commoner be superior to me…?’

Tristan Humphrey turned his head and stared blankly at Isaac, who was
chatting animatedly with Amy.

Putting aside the fact that he defeated a Class B upper-ranked student
such as Jack Schneider…

What even was that mana that he had sensed from Isaac?

His level had already far surpassed Tristan’s.

‘How is this possible…?’

Tristan simply could not believe that it was true.

Chapter 116: The End of the Second Semester (3)
===============================================

**༺ End of the Second Semester (3) ༻**

*Kwang!*

Dorm for top students at ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Charles Hall. Shared
kitchen.

A female student kicked open the kitchen door, revealing a mischievous
smile.

“How quiet!”

It was Dorothy Heartnova, a female student with flowing lavender hair.

She had left the witch hat that she usually wore back in her room. After
all, she would be bustling about from now on.

She entered the kitchen and made the glowing lamp brighter before tying
an apron around herself.

\[Yawn, what are you making?\]

“Something for Isaac to eat.”

As Ella, the white cat familiar with a ribbon on her tail, yawned while
asking, Dorothy tied her hair into a ponytail and responded.

\[Ahhh… But do you know how to cook?\]

“I haven’t tried since coming to the academy, but I used to do it a lot,
you know? Okay nice, preparations are done\~.”

Dorothy was now ready to cook.

After Dorothy brought out the ingredients she had prepared in advance
with her starlight mana…

She skillfully wielded the knife, adjusted the seasoning, and heated the
food as she cooked it to completion.

*Chop, chop.*

At first glance, dishes that boasted impressive appearances began to
pile up. Each time, Ella’s expression turned into one of astonishment.

\[Oh my…\]

She never imagined that her usually clumsy master would be so adept at
cooking.

“Huh.”

Suddenly, Dorothy, who was stirring the boiling soup in the pot, stopped
her hands.

\[What’s wrong, Dorothy?\]

“Aren’t I too perfect…? I’m starting to get scared of myself…!”

Dorothy’s hands trembled. Per usual, it was a sight of her basking in
her own greatness.

Ella was already accustomed to Dorothy boasting about herself
frequently.

Every time she did so, she couldn’t help but automatically sigh in
response.

However, at the same time, a smile appeared on her face.

Ella was Dorothy’s familiar so she could feel her master’s emotions.

Despite Dorothy always appearing lively, Ella had always sensed a deep
emotional pain, like being pricked by a skewer. However, she had never
brought it up on purpose because there was no point in doing so.

But now, it felt like most of that pain had been chased away.

Dorothy was shaking off the longing, regret, and pain that she had
always been ensnared by and finally began to enjoy the present to the
fullest.

“Nihihi. Not only am I pretty, but I’m also good at magic and cooking.
Doesn’t that totally make me…”

\[A great potential bride.\]

“…!”

Dorothy’s face turned bright red in an instant.

She pursured her lips as if she had heard something she shouldn’t have,
before silently stirring the hot soup in the pot.

\[Dorothy?\]

Although she had remarked without much thought, Ella anxiously worried
whether she had said something wrong.

Soon after, Dorothy let out laughter close to a moan with a ‘Nehehe’,
before managing to speak.

“Seriouslyyy\~… Refrain from saying that. What do you mean by a great
potential bride? Isn’t that a bit too muchhhh\~?”

Dorothy swayed her body happily. An expression of joy with a hint of
shyness. It was as if numerous flower petals were fluttering around her.

Ella glared at Dorothy.

No joke… It seemed like just imagining it was enough to make her die of
happiness.

\* \* \*

“President, how does it taste?!”

“It’s phenomenally delicious.”

“Good! What a great answer!”

The twisted tree branch was now covered with white snowflakes.

As the second semester came to an end with the end-of-semester
evaluations and the winter vacation ceremony was just a day away…

I was training elemental magic in the corner of the butterfly garden for
the first time in a while. With my fatigue gone and my mana depletion
state relieved, I was burning with enthusiasm.

Mana flowed much more stably than before. How would I put it…? It kinda
felt like my mana circuit had become more robust. It was similar to how
new muscle cells were created after a shitton of strength training.

This further fueled my already burning enthusiasm. It was definitely
worthwhile to push my limits in order to defeat the Floating Island.

When lunchtime came, Dorothy suddenly appeared, spread out a mat, and
laid out the dishes she brought with starlight mana.

I devoured it like a starving dog. No BS. The savory taste was so
prominent and light; I was about to go crazy because of how delicious it
was.

‘Is this for real? Did I die and go to heaven? My favorite character is
even good at cooking?”

After the Floating Island disappeared, everything about Dorothy was now
unknown territory.

There was no record of Dorothy cooking in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

***To think that Dorothy had this side to her. I never would have
guessed.***

“I prepared it to celebrate the return of the President’s mana. It isn’t
often that you can eat my cooking, okay?”

“Holy sh- The taste is actually insane. Wow…”

“…Actually, it might be a bit often!”

***Look at her oh-so-naturally switching up her words.***

Such trivial things felt like proof that I had become a precious person
to Dorothy which made me happy.

“Thank you for the meal.”

I finished every dish that Dorothy prepared without a single morsel left
over, then leaned against a zelkova tree beside her.

It was to digest what I just ate while also spending time with her.

But still, I couldn’t neglect my training, so I quietly conjured
\[Frostfire\] in one hand to train my \[Elemental Efficiency\].

“President.”

“Yes?”

“Have you planned something; like where to go during vacation?”

“For the most part, I’ll probably stay at the academy the entire time. I
don’t really have anywhere to go anyway.”

“What about your hometown?”

“There’s no one there, even if I go, so…”

I didn’t know where Isaac’s hometown was.

If I asked his older sister, Eve Ropenheim, I might find out, but for
some reason, she seemed to be deliberately avoiding me, so there was no
need to approach her.

In the first place, even if I went to his hometown, there would be no
one anyway.

“Hmmm.”

Dorothy made a meaningful expression.

Thanks to \[All In the World\], she could see through the essence of
everything and even had the ability to read emotions, so Dorothy was
actually very sharp in some unexpected aspects.

I didn’t really know the meaning behind making that expression instead
of questioning me further though.

Since I couldn’t read Dorothy’s mind and it was difficult to even
predict her emotions, I decided to not dwell on it any further.

“President, this Big Sis has been thinking about something.”

“Yes.”

“If you ever encounter any difficulties, let me know. I know the
President is stronger than me, but you’re not omnipotent. You can ask me
for help anytime, even if it’s a bit of an unreasonable request.”

“Hmm, all of a sudden?”

“What do you mean ‘all of a sudden’? Thanks to you, the curse was lifted
and I survived… In fact, I was actually late to say this. It’s just a
simple matter of repaying your kindness.”

Dorothy smiled brightly.

An unreasonable request. I did have something in mind.

‘That…’

***Should I ask her or not?***

I had pondered this question dozens of times.

At this point, it was probably not a bad time to ask…

***…Right?***

“…Then can I make an unreasonable request now?”

“Right away? So decisive… Well, fine. Whatever it is, tell me!”

“Please answer just one question. It is a bit of an impolite question
though…”

“That’s easy peasy\~. What is it?”

“On that day, did Senior kiss me?”

“…”

Suddenly, Dorothy flinched her head back before gazing at the sky. Her
face seemed to be in deep contemplation.

Whether she was trying to see through the intention behind my question
or pondering what kind of answer to give… I wasn’t too sure.

“Hey, President.”

Eventually, Dorothy smiled coyly, leaning her upper body towards me
while cocking her head.

“I didn’t know the President wanted to kiss me that badly\~.”

Dorothy’s uniquely captivating fragrance assaulted my sense of smell.

For a moment, my breathing stopped.

‘She really just went for it…’

I almost replied, ‘Of fucking course’…

I quickly regained my composure.

***Should I take this positively or as a joke?***

As I contemplated how to reply, Dorothy chuckled and leaned back against
the zelkova tree.

“This Big Sis is also a girl, you know? Those questions are
embarrassing, okay?”

***Didn’t you just say answering a mere question would be easy peasy?***

“Yes, well… I’ll refrain from doing so.”

But still, I was always on Dorothy’s side, so I didn’t want to make her
uncomfortable.

‘It’s fine if I get to know her little by little.’

I wasn’t sure whether she avoided answering due to embarrassment.

And I didn’t have even the slightest intention of interrogating Dorothy
about whether she kissed me or not.

After all, if it was true, that would be great. If not, it was whatever.

“By the way, President.”

At that moment, Dorothy brought up another topic as if waiting for the
right timing.

“There was something that happened that day that I wasn’t sure if I
should tell you about. But I thought it was the right thing to do.”

In the context of our conversation, ‘that day’ seemed to refer to the
time when we leaned against the wall of the hideout after defeating the
Floating Island.

***I just had to faint at the time when it would be ambiguous whether
Dorothy kissed me or not.***

“Didn’t you find it strange that you woke up safely at dawn? No matter
how robust the President’s body is, you pushed yourself wayyyyy too hard
at that time.”

Something certainly did feel out of place.

I roughly thought that Dorothy intermittently helped me recover after I
fainted. But the only reason I thought that was because that was the
only explanation that made sense.

“Did something else happen?”

“A cute kid called Kaya came to find you.”

***…Huh?***

“She seemed to really like the President. It also seemed like the
President had been sharing quite a bit of secrets with her for a while
now… And it seemed like you and her rely on each other quite a bit, you
know?”

“…”

“President is unexpectedly really popular, aren’t you?”

Dorothy was speaking with her usual smiling face, but…

Somehow… There was a thorn-like sensation in her voice. It was somewhat
menacing.

For now, I didn’t know what the exact circumstances were, but…

If Kaya had come, it made sense that I could safely wake up at dawn.

Soon after, Dorothy began to tell me about what had happened that day.

\* \* \*

After defeating the Floating Island.

It was the middle of the night when Isaac and Dorothy were sleeping
while leaning against the outer wall of the board-framed hideout.

As gentle light green mana floated like fireflies and seeped into their
bodies, Dorothy slowly opened her eyes from Isaac’s shoulder because her
chest felt warm.

“What are you doing?”

A solemn-like cute voice could be heard from the side.

Dorothy turned her head in that direction.

A female student with long verdant green hair was leaning against the
wall with both her hands clasped behind her butt.

School uniform, brilliant red pupils, and a placid expression.

Unlike usual, her hair wasn’t tied in twin tails.

By her hip, the Armana Wand was visible in her hand.

Around her, something similar to thick tree branches rose from the
ground, emitting vibrant green mana.

Isaac’s injuries, which couldn’t be healed by a mana depleted Dorothy,
was instantly treated.

Plant mana that could only be used by those who had been recognized by
Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy.

In terms of recovery magic, it was a top-tier element that far surpassed
any others in its performance.

Dorothy blankly stared at such a sight with her jaws agape.

“I guess you didn’t notice me coming because you were too busy fawning
over Sir Isaac, Senior.”

Dorothy remembered seeing her before.

During the Thunderbird Subjugation, she casted \[Tree of Radiance\] to
heal the injured.

And during the social gathering, she was the green-haired girl who had
run away with Isaac.

Magic Department 1st-year second seat, Kaya Astrea.

“…Did you follow us after seeing our fall?”

“Yes. Luckily, I found you. I’ve been here with Sir Isaac before, so
finding the way was easy.”

The honorific address, ‘Sir Isaac’. Her manner of speaking indicated a
clear and thorough understanding of the situation.

Only after Dorothy used \[Emotional Insight\] did she realize that Kaya
was someone who knew Isaac’s secrets.

“Thank you for coming… It seemed like Isaac here would have taken a
whole day for his condition to improve. Thanks to you, he can recover
much faster.”

“…”

Kaya furrowed her brows towards Dorothy who was smiling faintly.

Isaac was in such a state to save Dorothy.

She couldn’t even fathom how terrifying of a demon the Floating Island
must have been. In human terms, perhaps it had reached the level of an
Archwizard.

That was probably why Isaac seemed to have struggled desperately for the
first time. Even when putting it lightly, his physical condition wasn’t
good at all.

Dorothy probably couldn’t do anything either. It was understandable.
But…

“What nonsense are you spouting?”

A murderous tone.

Kaya modestly gathered her legs and sat on the ground before tucking her
flowing hair behind her ear.

And then, while resting her chin on her hand, she shot a cynical look at
Dorothy.

Kaya’s blood-red pupils boasted a beautiful color.

“Sir Isaac is someone who will become my man. Who does Senior think she
is to nonchalantly say that my man’s condition will so easily improve?
Sir Isaac became like this because he wanted to save Senior.”

“…Huh?”

“It’s a huge relief that Senior is safe. I’m sure you had your own
unavoidable circumstances. But still, despite being that strong… Senior
was powerless to do anything and even made Sir Isaac suffer… I hate you,
Senior.”

Kaya loved Isaac as a man. Of that she was certain.

There was no doubt that there could have been various circumstances for
both Dorothy and Isaac.

However, because Dorothy brought back the man she loved in such a
severely injured state, Kaya did not have the will nor a sound enough
mind to be respectful to Dorothy.

After all, she was so heartbroken that it was driving her crazy.

As such, the fact that Dorothy talked so nonchalantly when he had
exerted himself to this extent didn’t sit well with Kaya.

“…”

Dorothy didn’t say anything. She couldn’t

She had planned to sacrifice her life to bring down the Floating Island…

And Isaac had overexerted himself just to save her.

Of course, Dorothy had worn her smiling mask merely out of habit.
Inside, she was deeply concerned about Isaac.

However, Dorothy’s feelings were probably not properly conveyed to Kaya.

“Hoo.”

Kaya sighed deeply and then stood up to approach Isaac.

As she sat back down, she leaned against Isaac’s chest as if embracing
him.

“Huh?”

Dorothy was taken aback.

With blushed cheeks, Kaya buried her face in Isaac’s blood-soaked school
uniform before lifting her face and glaring at Dorothy with a scowl.

It was as if she was nailing down the fact that Isaac was her man.

“I secretly sneaked out of the subjugation force, so I have to go back
soon… but I have no intention of yielding Sir Isaac to Senior.”

After asserting that, Kaya smiled while gazing at Isaac.

The verdant green mana reflected onto his deeply sleeping face, creating
a flickering shadow on the snow-filled ground.

He was, indeed, incredibly lovely.

“Sir Isaac, I’ll see you soon. I love you.”

Kaya gently kissed Isaac’s cheek before standing up.

“Although I said some hateful things… Thank you for staying alive as
well, Senior.”

The tree branches formed from plant mana turned into verdant dust that
shone like a firefly before scattering away.

In the lingering aftermath of the scattered verdant mana, Kaya swiftly
turned her back and left the forest path with her verdant green hair
flowing behind her.

Dorothy was left in a daze.

Chapter 117: End of the Second Semester (4)
===========================================

**༺ End of the Second Semester (4) ༻**

“Starting now, we will proceed with the Magic Department Winter Vacation
Ceremony of Märchen Academy!”

The white snow had adorned Märchen Academy with its color.

Morning. Magic Department school district. The square in front of Orphin
Hall.

Students from the Magic Department, dressed in uniforms and cape shawls,
stood in an orderly manner in the square according to their year.

The female professor in charge of Class C for the Magic Department
freshmen stood on the platform, conducting the vacation ceremony with an
energetic voice.

For me, it was the last academy event as a Magic Department freshman.

I roughly heard the speech delivered by Headmistress Elena Woodline, as
she reflected on the appearance of demons, the Floating Island, and the
eventful year we had experienced.

Ah, it was quite heart-wrenching to see her eyes moisten as she recalled
how much she had suffered this year.

‘The road of hardship is still far from over though.’

***Please don’t cry already. After all, there will be many difficult
days ahead…***

Soon after, following the host’s call, the top seats of the Magic
Department’s first and second year stepped forward as representatives of
their respective years.

The first year top seat was a female student with rose-gold hair
cascading down to her waist, Luce Eltania.

And the second year top seat was a female student with long light purple
hair, Dorothy Heartnova.

My fists clenched.

***My favorite characters!***

Their beauty was insanely dazzling…!

Although they were bundled up in the same uniforms and cape shawls, even
the sight of their backs in front of the podium seemed like a halo was
shining around them.

Heuhhh, I couldn’t help but let out a smile reminiscent of a proud
father.

For reference, the vacation ceremony was only for students who would
return the next year.

The third year students were prospective graduates, so they did not
stand on the platform. Instead, they would have a grand ceremony at
their graduation.

Headmistress Elena, wearing a white coat on her shoulders, stood in
front of the two top seats.

She removed the red gem attached to Luce’s brooch and replaced it with a
blue gem that symbolized a second year student.

In the same way, she attached a purple gem, symbolizing a third year
student, to Dorothy’s brooch as well.

When Headmistress Elena shook hands with the two female students, the
students erupted in cheers and applause.

During the applause…

I turned my gaze towards a female student with green twin tails, Kaya
Astrea.

With her lips tightly sealed, Kaya was looking down with disappointed
eyes.

‘She seems frustrated.’

During the end-of-semester evaluation, Kaya had a duel with Luce and
lost.

Even if Kaya had become much stronger than the original scenario, Luce
still held her position like an insurmountable wall.

It was probably difficult for Kaya to endure the overwhelming sense of
inferiority.

“…”

Since yesterday, the story Dorothy told me had been lingering in my
mind.

After defeating the Floating Island, I had no idea that Kaya would come
to the hideout and heal me.

Come to think of it, Kaya had abruptly appeared and saved me from a
crisis. There were many things that would have been troublesome without
her.

Suddenly, these thoughts occurred to me.

If I hadn’t built a connection with Kaya…

***…How would have things turned out for me?***

‘I would’ve fought against the Thunderbird and died.’

That’s right… I would’ve been fucked.

‘Thank you… for everything.’

***You’re the savior of my life.***

It seemed that only then did Kaya notice my gaze, as she turned her head
and met my eyes with her jade-colored pupils.

“Heuahh…”

Kaya’s face reddened noticeably. It seemed that she was embarrassed at
the thought of me looking at her.

She quickly turned back before drooping her head.

Her shoulder stiffened as it rose up and steam seemed to rise above her
head.

It was the same old Kaya.

\*\*\*

As the vacation ceremony concluded, students scattered in all
directions.

Märchen Academy had finally opened its doors to the outside world and
many students left for their hometown via carriage. In a few days, the
academy would become very quiet.

Regardless, what I had to do remained the same as it had always been.

‘Training.’

During the vacation, the training grounds became practically deserted. I
couldn’t miss this golden opportunity.

As I looked around on the way to the training grounds, I captured the
beautiful and snowy landscape of Märchen Academy in my eyes.

When I exhaled, a hazy steam of breath flowed out before quietly
disappearing into the air.

It was clearly a sign of winter.

“…”

As I was admiring the scenery, I then stopped in my tracks.

At dawn…

A tree stump I had sat crouched on came into view.

It was the day of the entrance ceremony.

On that dawn when the gloomy sky poured spring rain, I had sat crouched
on that tree, blankly watching the sight of raindrops freeze as they
touched \[Ice Curtain.\]

The sense of helplessness I felt at that time vividly came back to me
even now.

1 year. The first year possessing Isaac, an extra that appeared in
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I had survived the Thunderbird, destroyed the Floating Island, and saved
Dorothy. Moreover, I had prevented many Bad Endings.

And I didn’t die. I survived and didn’t break away from the journey to
defeat the Evil God.

“…I’m proud.”

A small laughter suddenly burst out. It wasn’t easy but I was proud that
I was still alive.

I began to walk once again.

As the second semester ended…

My first year met its conclusion here.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 103

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** (2nd)

**Title:** Prospective Second Year

**Mana:** 24000/24000

– Mana Recovery Speed (B+)

\*\*\*

Training grounds.

As I held Zhonya’s Staff and faced illusions of demonic creatures, I was
lost in thought.

After all, it was necessary to organize the current situation and
continuously solidify plans for the future.

As of the end of the second semester of the first, I was ranked 45th in
my year.

It was a rank calculated by summing up all the evaluation results I had
received during the second semester.

I was confirmed to receive the Self-Development Excellence scholarship,
which was given to the student who showed the most significant
improvement in grades compared to the previous semester.

I wasn’t particularly happy. After all, I knew it would turn out this
way. I merely felt a sense of relief.

Anyway, I wouldn’t have to worry about tuition fees during this winter
vacation.

Moreover, I was also confirmed to relocate dorms.

I was currently accommodated in the dorm for middle-low ranked students,
Briggs Hall.

Before the start of the first semester, I would move to the dorm for
middle-high-ranked students, Elma Hall.

From Elma Hall onwards, the facilities would dramatically improve and
the involvement of the school-affiliated maids in my daily life would
expand.

In other words, life was going to become much more convenient and
comfortable.

Of course, personal maids could be hired, but that was something that
wasn’t relevant to a commoner like me.

‘But the coolest thing is…’

I could obtain both End Game-Grade magic weapons before I even became a
second year.

This time, I had made up my mind to obtain Gormos’ Greatsword, but…

Unfortunately, the situation was different from the time with Frost
Dragon-Hilde.

‘Because I can’t form a contract with Gormos to be my familiar.’

The one guarding Gormos’ Greatsword was Stone Turtle-Gormos. He was an
8-star magic beast.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, to form a contract with an 8-star magic
beast who was guarding an ultimate weapon, three conditions had to be
met.

Firstly, possessing an 8-star familiar contract circle.

Secondly, obtaining the ultimate weapon through a trial.

Thirdly, proving superiority by defeating the 8-star magic beast in a
battle.

***Yep, that’s right. That was the standard.***

It was just that the situation with Frost Dragon-Hilde was special.

‘That’s why one could only form a familiar contract after reaching the
very late stages of the game.’

In other words, if I wished to make the Stone Turtle my familiar, I had
to follow standard procedure.

I had to become strong enough to fight and win against the Stone Turtle.

‘I also have to prepare for the first semester of the second year.’

When considering the first semester, four keywords came to mind.

Golden Generation.

The Deep Sea Monster, a demon that dropped an End Game-Grade magic
weapon for Luce.

Miko.

Alice Subjugation Battle.

‘What should I do about Luce’s ring?”

I considered Luce as one of the members of the Evil God Subjugation
Force.

As such, upgrading her specs directly correlated with strengthening my
full power.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, if certain conditions were met, ‘Ring of
the Abyssal Queen’ could be dropped.

And that was Luce’s End Game-Grade magic weapon.

‘I have to obtain it no matter what.’

However, the problem was that…

‘It has to be worn on the left ring finger to activate its effects…’

Apparently, due to the backstory behind the Ring of the Abyssal Queen,
the context behind wearing a ring on the left ring finger was equivalent
to a proposal in this world as well.

During the time I played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it sometimes felt
that the game developers had some shady intentions.

How exactly I would naturally give her that ring… was something I had to
ponder.

‘Also…’

Although unrelated to the progress of the scenario, there was something
I desperately wanted to find out.

‘How does Alice know everything?’

After the player achieved victory in the Alice Subjugation Battle, Alice
took her own life with a smile before exiting the stage and taking all
the mysteries about her to her grave.

Anyone who had played ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ wouldn’t want to miss
the opportunity to relieve this curiosity.

***Why would I be an exception?***

As such, if possible, I wished to find out how Alice knew everything.

As I was lost in such thoughts…

“Ha!”

Suddenly, a familiar burst of laughter was heard.

It happened to be the moment when I defeated the last demonic illusion,
thus concluding the first wave.

I looked in the direction of the sound.

Unexpectedly, someone was passing through the entrance and approaching
me.

A man who was fashionably dressed in neat aristocratic attire.

It was the vain blond noble, Tristan Humphrey.

“Tristan?”

“Training right after the vacation ceremony? How ridiculous, commoner!”

With his nose raised, Tristan let out a haughty laughter.

Judging by his civilian attire, it seemed like he was going back to his
hometown and it didn’t look like he came all the way here to train.

In other words…

‘Did he come to see me?’

***…Nah, it’s more likely that he just came to pick a fight with me.
It’s Tristan after all.***

Tristan maintained his distance from me before stopping.

As usual, his arrogant smile was plastered across his face.

“Even during the second year, you’ll still be under my feet!”

“…?”

***…What a load of crap.***

“That’s how it is, commoner! No matter how much you try to spread your
wings and fly, it is impossible to even get close to me. I will continue
to make you bitterly feel that truth, even after we become second
years!”

Tristan pompously made a declaration of war.

Mmm, well…

I just roughly interpreted it as, ‘Let’s get along well, even after
becoming second years’.

“Keuheheh! Struggle all you want! I’ll crush you with my pursuit of
knowledge after all!”

After Tristan let out words reminiscent of a third-rate villain, he
turned around and started walking away.

He mockingly laughed, “Keuhahahah!”, before coughing as if he choked on
something.

\[Tristan Humphrey\] **Lv:** 92

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Wind, Water

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to become stronger than you.\]

It seemed that Tristan had felt my mana during the end-of-semester
evaluation and judged me as being superior to himself.

If it was Tristan, he would have been greatly stimulated by such a fact.

He had a personality that couldn’t live knowing the bitter taste of
inferiority. He always strived for improvement, polishing himself
endlessly.

And that kind of guy had been surpassed by the commoner, Isaac, who he
had always looked down on…

As such, there was only one reaction that Tristan would express.

‘He’ll work even harder.’

He would acknowledge the objective hierarchy, accept such a reality, and
work even harder.

He knew the value of effort through experience and didn’t lightly
belittle the result of others’ accumulated efforts.

And, more than anyone else, he wanted to prove his superiority through
the result of his hard work.

It was his way of life.

Hence, it seemed like he had made a declaration of war against me to
strengthen his determination.

‘Well, I’m somewhat similar to you as well.’

The final stop I aimed for at this academy was Evil God Nephid.

As always, my target for comparison was that demon.

If I were to fight right now, it was objectively clear that I’d get the
shit kicked out of me.

As such, all I could do was work myself to death in order to defeat that
demon.

Tristan’s figure from the back disappeared beyond the entrance.

Without his intention, his words actually fueled a renewed determination
within me.

As the second wave of demonic illusions began…

Ice mana bloomed from my hands.

It was only a matter of time before I faced the Trial of Sandstone to
obtain Gormos’ Greatsword.

Chapter 118: Monologue (1)
==========================

༺ **■■■■ (4) – Fictional Hell** ༻

I almost had a heart attack.

Of course, I knew there would be a full moon, but my heart still skipped
a beat at the realization.

I took a deep breath to calm myself down.

***I guess I’m weak against things like this…***

On top of that, the Berserker’s cry escaped my lips without me realizing
it. It didn’t match my voice at all; it was as if it felt my emotions
and spat them out like an AI.

Anyway, if I had been a second too late, it could have been an
irreversible situation.

Looking at Professor Fernando, he was on the verge of collapsing!

He looked like he would pass out at any moment, but he was doing his
best to hold on to his consciousness. Poor thing.

I should probably reassure him and let him pass out in peace.

\[…Who are you?\]

The moon’s voice echoed softly.

***That thing doesn’t look very pleasant. Look at that nice-looking set
of teeth. I really want to give it a light uppercut and knock ‘em
out.***

This was \[Fictional Hell\] and that repulsive looking full moon was
‘Leafa the Illusive’.

The creator of this world, and this was his domain.

“You can’t tell what I’m saying anyway.” (Grrrr─)

I was currently unable to communicate. I was a Berserker with zero
language skills.

In this state, it would be difficult to communicate with words, I would
instead communicate with my fists.

\[Ah, it’s you—\]

Only then did Leafa, in the form of the moon, seem to realize I was the
demon hunter.

“Huh?” (Greung?)

Before long, the Night Sky Monsters began to rise out of the sea.

Dozens, thousands, tens of thousands of monsters—countless monsters with
different shapes and sizes appeared.

*-Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!*

It was then that an earthquake occurred, and a massive arm stretched out
from the ground to beyond the horizon.

\[Wheeeeeeeeew────!!\]

A gigantic monster rose from the sea, it was a Giant wearing a skull
mask on its face, its whole body covered with the night sky where the
Milky Way flowed.

Seeing it from this far away, it appeared to be of a size that went
beyond imagination. Even then, it was much smaller than the octopus in
the sky.

\[The troublemaker. You’re the one who’s been a nuisance to us demons,
aren’t you?\]

***Of course.***

***You will also be dealt with soon enough.***

The \[Fictional Hell\] would soon grow in size and engulf Duke Hall. I
had to defeat him before that to prevent any victims other than
Professor Fernando.

\[Ah, I wanted to meet you! I’ve been wondering what that crazy guy was
like! Heh heh heh! I’m so happy right now!\]

“Is that so?” (Grrr—)

\[Troublemaker, troublemaker—! Let me play with you—!\]

The full moon cried out, laughing like a child, as the monsters began to
pounce on me, their huge mouths grotesquely laughing.

\[Kyahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—! Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha—!
Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha————!\]

\[Fictional Creature\] **Lv:** 80

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Darkness, Fire

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to bite you.\]

If I get killed by these monsters, I would lose my mind and become a
vegetable.

The strength of each individual couldn’t be ignored and with an infinite
number of them spawning, no matter how hard I fought, it would only be a
long-term battle that I was bound to lose.

I didn’t know if they even gave a lot of experience points because in
the game they wouldn’t give any at all to prevent abuse from easy power
leveling.

It was a part of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, 「Act 6, Chapter 3,
Fictional Hell, the Subjugation of Leafa the Illusive.

The player must protect the students by defeating the fictional
creatures. That was because Leafa held a *defense game* against Ian and
his colleagues while imprisoning the students.

If even one student died, it was game over, so I remembered swearing a
lot and retrying.

After surviving for a certain amount of time, a story cutscene would
appear. This was the scene where Ian Fairytale learned how to attack
this world.

The main character, Ian Fairytale, struggled with his supporters, but
somehow endured with the determination to protect the students…

As he swung his sword, he repeated to himself, *‘I can do it’.*

Eventually, he started self-hypnosis while saying *‘I am strong’* or *‘I
can be stronger’.*

And then he became surprised by how strong he really was. That was how
the full-scale subjugation against Leafa began in earnest.

‘Yes, the \[Fictional Hell\] strategy is…’

‘Self-hypnosis’.

***I have to be like a delusional person.***

It was to confront the world of illusion with delusion. If I hadn’t
learned this strategy, even a level 180 Dorothy Heartnova would have no
choice but to struggle.

However, if one learned how to play around it, even a normal level 51
Isaac, could defeat him with \[Hunter\] inactive.

The key was that I had to visualize myself getting stronger. The more I
know what would happen if I became stronger, the more effective it would
be.

If I couldn’t visualize myself becoming stronger, there was no point in
learning this strategy.

As a veteran of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I had a clear understanding
of what it was like to master the ice element.

In other words, I was Leafa’s natural enemy.

“…”

Everything in this world was against me.

Firstly, I put an \[Ice Barrier\] around Professor Fernando.

「Ice Barrier (Ice Element, ★6)」

***Let’s visualize.***

‘Myself becoming a Munchkin^1^Korean word for Over Powered.’

For just a moment, I shut out the world; a skill I had acquired while
studying when confined to my desk during my exam life, disconnecting
myself from the world.

I colored myself, and my own life, into nothingness.

The world became silent as I redefined myself in it.

I am strong.

I am strong.

I am the strongest in the world.

Strong.

Every cell in my body felt unfamiliar. I gently lowered my head and took
a brief moment to get used to this unfamiliar sensation.

My skin was more saturated, and my body seemed brighter. The hair on the
inside of my hood felt like it stood on its ends, and my nerves were
alert.

Light blue cold air flowed gently from my whole body, and I felt as if I
was capable of using the most powerful magic in the world.

My body, everything in me, felt so dense and heavy, but at the same
time, I became light.

Passive skill, \[Ice Sovereign\].

Its effects were simple and clear.

It maximized the output of the ice magic I was about to use.

“Hah.”

My eyes took in the world rushing toward me.

A light blue chill escaped from my breath.

***It’s time for you to sleep.***

***Since from now on, I’m a Super Saiyan.***

\* \* \*

Dorothy entered \[Fictional Hell\].

It was easy to enter that magical space. It was as if she were crossing
another dimension. She was swimming in the black hole-like darkness, and
a beautiful landscape opened up in her field of vision.

An open sea that mirrored the night sky and abandoned buildings dotted
the landscape.

The night sky was filled with stars and The Milky Way, a giant octopus
watching her from beyond the universe, rings of planets streaking across
the sky, and a full moon with a mouth large enough to cover half of its
body.

And.

An army of monsters rushing at Professor Fernando and a hulking figure
in an ultramarine blue hooded coat.

Dorothy watched the spectacle from the sky, frozen in place.

◆◆◆◆◆────

With the activation of her unique trait \[All in the World\], Dorothy
confirmed the unknown existence hidden in the giant’s essence; a
near-infinite mass of mana. An overwhelming power that could swallow
everything in this world.

She would never forget where she had seen it.

“Isaac?”

It was Isaac, a silver-blue haired first-year student.

But it was definitely not him; the hulking man was a hooded, muscular
monster.

‘…A magic disguise?’

Dorothy got the answer. Other than a Magic Cloak of Disguise, nothing
could explain Isaac’s drastic change in appearance.

But why?

The being in Isaac’s essence was staring elsewhere, its countless eyes
all bright red. As if Dorothy didn’t matter.

The place all those eyes were focused was the full moon. Dorothy
realized that the true identity of the full moon was a demon, with the
power of \[All in the World\].

Only then did she know.

The unknown being in Isaac’s essence was hostile to the demons.

\[ ■■ ■■■ ■ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■. \]

***It was a very harsh life.***

The being in Isaac’s essence began to chant.

As soon as the introduction rang out, a chill ran down Dorothy’s spine.

“This is dangerous…”

Dorothy channeled her mana to its maximum output, covering herself with
a powerful shield of starlight.

Isaac intended to use powerful magic that could destroy this world. He
was so focused on casting the spell that he didn’t even sense Dorothy’s
mana.

In other words, Dorothy would have to defend herself against Isaac’s
magic.

Fernando didn’t have to defend, since Isaac had already prepared the
safest means of protection, the \[Ice Barrier\].

\[ ■■■ ■ ■■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Not a single thing remained by my side.***

\[ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Nothing had meaning in my life.***

In ancient times, there was someone said to have fully mastered the ice
element.

A woman whose name had been lost to time, and was now referred to by
‘Ice Sovereign’ or ‘Witch with a Scythe’, had created magic with her own
life.

The miserable words of an Archwizard who found no meaning in continuing
to exist in this world.

A chant filled with grief and resentment.

At the end of her life, a calamity plunged the world into a hundred year
ice age.

Soon, behind the Berserker-shaped Isaac, a series of light blue magic
circles began to materialize in quick succession, like cogs in a wheel.

\[ ■■■■■■■■■■. \]

***Loneliness.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■. \]

***Only you were by my side.***

\[ ■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■. \]

***I did not revel in the glory of endless victories alone.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■. \]

***Fame and fortune had no meaning.***

\[ ■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■ ■■■■■■■. \]

***Only when the owl of dusk spread its wings did I realize.***

The giant octopus floating in space sensed the danger and began to
strike down with its feet.

The air vibrated. The giant octopus, which could easily subdue an army
of monsters with a single arm, fell with a violent crash.

The scenery of the beautiful night sky disappeared, and the surroundings
were colored with shadows—

\[ ■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■■ ■■■. \]

***This world with only you.***

In the darkness, clusters of magic circles carved out the thin air at
irregular intervals, even as the octopus’ arms descended upon the world.

Behind all those magic circles, a huge magic circle drew a trajectory
that seemed to touch the sky.

It glowed brilliantly.

Isaac stretched his right arm upward.

Massive amounts of ice mana coalesced like a whirlpool and became a cold
sun that cast a pale blue light.

The cold sun grew larger and larger in an instant, even surpassing the
sky itself.

\[ ■■ ■■■■ ■■■■. \]

***Is like hell.***

When the unknown monster’s essence finished those words, Isaac lowered
his arm.

The cold sun began to fall on the hordes of monsters that began to look
like ants.

And it was only for a moment.

「Cocytus (Ice Element, ★9)」

*Kwaaaaaaaaaahhh━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!!!*

*Chaaaaaaaaaaaaaah━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!!!*

The cold sun’s rays pierced through the clouds.

It drove away the darkness and brought blue light to the sky.

In the blink of an eye, the sea froze over, and an icy cold wave raged
violently, ravaging the world.

A rampaging freeze of death.

Cold winds and heavy snow.

Numerous ice spikes rose from the ground, penetrating the already-frozen
monsters.

A beam of light spread out in all directions, engulfing everything in
its path.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Snap.

The night sky turned white and this world became a frozen hell, as its
name suggested.

Cold gusts of wind and frozen ice prevailed, transforming the land into
a hellhole of extreme cold that would kill anyone who entered.

The army of monsters and abandoned buildings were obliterated by the
beam of light.

Outside the sky, the giant octopus was frozen solid and time seemed to
stand still.

Dorothy and Fernando were speechless.

“I just… What did I just see…?”

It was far beyond their imagination.

Dorothy’s starlight shield was a wreck. Despite the distance between
herself and Isaac, despite the fact that it was a shield made by using
the maximum output of her mana, and despite the fact that she controlled
and blocked the surrounding natural forces…

It was not difficult to imagine the scene where she would have been
annihilated if she ran at Isaac like a certain army of monsters and was
hit by \[Cocytus\].

“Huh…”

Fernando burst into laughter as if it were absurd.

The overwhelming strength of the man standing in front of him evoked a
sense of emptiness rather than admiration.

For whatever reason, it was a relief to know that a monster among
monsters was on his side.

He could no longer hold onto his consciousness. In relief, Fernando laid
down and collapsed.

\[Uh, how…?\]

Compared to others, Leafa was less affected by \[Cocytus\]. He must have
been watching over this world from farther away than anyone else. Even
so, his full moon body was frozen in various places. Because of its
gigantic form, its condition was reflected even in the eyes of Isaac and
Dorothy.

Then, Isaac bent his knees and kicked off the ice…

*Kuuung─!*

…And started running toward the full moon.

*Kuuung─!*

*Kuuung─!*

*Kuuung─!*

Isaac ran across the ice, his body soaring through the sky with every
step.

To Leafa, it was the sound of approaching death.

Isaac took one step after another, and then he propelled himself like a
rocket toward the full moon.

*Kwaaaang—!*

\[Oh, no…! G-get away…! Do not come—!\]

A deep sense of dread washed over Leafa. His survival instincts were
screaming at him.

***He’s dangerous. He’s dangerous. He can’t be defeated. The possibility
of winning doesn’t even exist.***

***How can such a being exist in this academy? How can there be such an
abnormal monster!?***

The only one who could deal with someone like this was the Evil God
Nephid.

Isaac conjured \[Frostfire\] from both hands behind his body, and
propelled himself across \[Cocytus\]. The \[Frostfire\] vastly increased
his momentum as he traveled across the frozen sea.

The speed was incredible. He couldn’t follow Isaac’s movement with his
eyes.

\[Do not come———!!\]

As soon as the distance closed a little, Isaac’s magic would be able to
reach Leafa.

Leafa screamed in terror and released \[Fictional Hell\]. He wanted to
escape as quickly as possible.

*Clink—*————

*Chararararara*—————

The world shattered into pieces like a broken pane of glass.

In an instant, light engulfed everything, \[Fictional Hell\] was
released, and bizarre purple mana dispersed into the air.

All those who were inside returned to the outside world.

The familiar and ordinary scenery of Duke Hall’s rooftop was reflected
in their eyes.

*Rooooooarrrrr*─*!*

As soon as \[Fictional Hell\] was released, a wall of black flame rose
up and split the center of the rooftop.

「Flame Wall (Fire Element, ★4)」 +「Black Flame (Fire Element, ★5)」

= 「Black Flame Wall (Fire Element)」

\[Ah… AHH!\]

In the meantime, Leafa tried to quickly run away.

「Ice Wall (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Drrrrrrrr*─*!*

Walls of ice rose from all sides, creating a ceiling and blocking any
means of escape.

And then.

*Snap*─

“Gotcha.”

Isaac’s hand cut through the flames and grabbed Leafa’s head.

Before he knew it, his mask was off and his hood was down, and Isaac had
regained his original appearance and voice.

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

The ice lightly created by Isaac ignored its elemental disadvantage and
extinguished the flames.

Die. Die.

Leafa trembled and examined the overwhelming monster with his \[Second
Eye\].

\[…Huh?\]

For a moment, Leafa doubted his own eyes.

Wavy silver hair with a bluish tint, and cold red eyes.

The weakest of Märchen Academy’s freshmen in the Magic Department, with
a Grade E in mana.

He was a candidate who could not even be considered a hindrance, more
than anyone else. Because of that, he didn’t even watch his duel.

\[Grade E…? How could you…?\]

His mind started to jumble with confusion. Leafa couldn’t understand
this situation at all.

\[…!\]

Isaac, without answering, began condensing ice mana into his other hand
and a magic circle of \[Frost Explosion\] materialized in front of him.

Leafa was startled.

\[S-save me…! Spare me, please…!\]

A pitiful voice.

However, Leafa’s desperate cry only echoed helplessly in the small space
made by \[Ice Wall\].

Chapter 119: Monologue (2)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (2) ༻**

As the pitch-black darkness descended in an instant, a mana that had
been concentrated for a long time enveloped my entire body.

I looked around. In the total darkness, the only glimmer of golden light
caught my eye.

As I moved towards it, what unfolded before my eyes was–.

“Ooh.”

A cavern so immense that its size couldn’t be estimated.

Mana circuits, flowing like blood vessels, crossed the walls in golden
hues.

The rock mana emitted a topaz light akin to the sun from the center of
the ceiling.

Center of the cavern.

Seemingly a mere rock at first, a colossal turtle caught my eye.

Eyes shut. Hard rock shell. An exterior resembling that of an Alligator
Snapping Turtle.

The light-brown shell resembled a massive rock mountain with protruding
golden crystals.

“Gormos…”

He was once known as the hands and feet of the Primordial Rock
Sovereign, a mythological rock elemental magic beast.

He was the Stone Turtle-Gormos.

\[Stone Turtle-Gormos\] **Lv:** 180

**Race:** Magic Beast

**Elements:** Rock

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wary of you\]

As expected, his overwhelming presence was no joke when I saw him in
person.

Although when he was lying down it felt like he was one with the ground,
if he was to stand, his size would be larger than most mountains.

Stone Turtle-Gormos slowly opened his eyes, revealing light brown
pupils. Those very same pupils fixed their gazes on me.

\[You know my name, I see.\]

The Stone Turtle narrowed his eyes.

A deep male voice. The calm elderly tone was like one of an intellectual
as it resonated in my mind.

\[…I sense the aura of the Ice Sovereign in you. I see you have risen to
a formidable level at such a young age.\]

At least this guy didn’t entertain some ridiculous misconceptions like
how I was the reincarnated Ice Sovereign or whatever.

That was enough for me to be satisfied.

\[Have you come to face the Trial of Sandstone?\]

At this point in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there were two possible
choices as a response.

*‘Yes’* or *‘Please wait a moment’.*

Of course, my response had already been determined.

“Yes.”

\[I shall open the door of the Trial.\]

With a rumble, the ground beneath my feet shook for a moment. I nearly
fell…

I turned my head to the side, where the sound was coming from. The rock
on the walls spread apart, creating a passage illuminated by light brown
mana.

It was exactly the same as the Trial of Frost. From the moment I entered
that passage, Gormos’ Greatsword would turn me into stone before trying
to crush me to death.

\[Another world will consume your mind, and your physical body will
gradually turn into stone. Those who are unworthy will meet their end,
as they shatter into tiny bits of gravel. Overcome the trial and prove
that you’re worthy to become the Master of the Obsidian Blade.\]

The Stone Turtle recited the official lines, the same lines I had heard
in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Obsidian Blade.

The original name of the ultimate elemental weapon known as Gormos’
Greatsword.

That was my goal.

‘I’m getting nervous…’

I swallowed dryly.

In the game, the Ultimate Weapon Trials were designed to eat away the
main character’s mind by weaving together his memories, actual events,
and events that could have possibly happened.

The problem was that this could only be experienced once in every
playthrough of the game.

However, after clearing the Trial of Frost, I found myself in a position
where I had to overcome another Elemental Trial for the second time.

This was something that could never happen in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I didn’t know if the contents were similar to the Trial of Frost; If it
was, it could be a repetition of before, where I had to oppose Alice, or
the Evil God, or confront another traumatic event related to Isaac.

‘…I can’t predict what will pop out anyway.’

There was no need to dwell on it. In the first place, were the contents
of the Trial of Frost exactly as I predicted? Of course not.

It was business as usual. I simply needed to overcome it.

My elemental bracelet was attuned to the Rock Element. With this, my
\[Rock Elemental Resistance\] was increased by 40.

I closed my eyes and pulled myself together.

Then, I slowly stepped forward, entering the passage radiating a topaz
light.

“…”

As I entered the gap between the rocks, a long dimly lit passage
stretched out before me. Yellow stone fragments floated in the air.

Thanks to them, I could somewhat distinguish my surroundings. It was a
far cry from the pitch-black darkness of the Trial of Frost.

*Kuuuuuuuuu──.*

As expected, a brutal noise began to emanate from the ceiling.

Since the light didn’t reach the ceiling, when I raised my head, all I
could see was a pitch-black.

It wasn’t difficult to guess that the sound was caused by the ceiling
itself, as it slowly descended.

If I didn’t pass the Trial of Sandstone in time, I would be crushed
under that ceiling before turning into stone rubble.

At the end of the passage, I could see an entrance emitting yellow
light. The Obsidian Blade was probably there.

However, I couldn’t sprint at full speed because of the yellow stone
fragments floating around.

‘It’s a trap after all.’

Each stone fragment was a massive concentration of mana. Any area of my
body that touched it would turn into stone at an even more rapid pace.

If I ignored them and just ran, I wouldn’t even be able to endure a
minute before my entire body was entirely petrified.

Wearing armor wouldn’t help either. After all, in front of these stone
fragments with densely packed mana, a person like me was practically no
better than naked.

That was why I purposely dressed comfortably.

‘Let’s go.’

I proceeded with hurried steps.

It felt as if there was no moisture in the air at all. I could feel my
skin becoming more and more dry. My face and body gradually stiffened.

This was the sensation of turning into stone.

When I suddenly thought of an Isaac statue, I couldn’t help but burst
out into uncontrollable laughter.

‘Everything I have done would be futile. How anticlimactic.’

Although it was frightening, thanks to the effects of \[Frozen Soul\],
my fear quickly subsided.

My steps had no hesitation. I carefully avoided the yellow stone
fragments, but I didn’t slow down.

Soon after…

A man’s voice resonated in my mind.

────Face the Trial of Sandstone.

Just like that, my consciousness drifted into infinity.

◆ ◆ ◆

The humid air wetted my lungs.

I scrunched up my nose at the musty smell and quietly opened my eyes.

A bright light flooded my vision. It was the light from the nightstand
on top of the desk.

The ticking of a clock’s hand echoed in my ear. A routine noise that
went unnoticed unless one deliberately paid attention to it.

I remembered myself pondering whether my concentration had broken due to
the sound of the clock’s hand.

“…”

I was sprawled across the desk.

I lifted my head. As I wiped away the drool from the corner of my mouth
and looked around, the view of a cramped one-room semi-basement filled
my sight.

Thick law book piled up so high that it was suffocating just to look at.

A video game console squeezed into a tiny gap that was somehow created
in such a cramped space.

A humidifier emitted a red light. It seemed that the water tank had been
full for quite some time.

I turned my gaze back to the desk.

A summary of social welfare and civil law was fixed on the reading desk

In front of that were civil law practice problems for the first round of
the bar exam and a notebook filled with the traces of solved problems.

It seemed I had fallen asleep on top of the book.

On the shelf above the desk, books that seemed to have been repeatedly
read with intense focus were arranged in an orderly manner.

A briquet-shaped keyring I received while doing briquette delivery
volunteer work, a pretty hourglass whose origins I couldn’t recall, and
a water bottle containing marimo that I bought at the thought that it
might alleviate my loneliness were all unnecessarily placed there.

The wall was covered with various post-it notes.

They contained trivial philosophical quotes scribbled down, as if by
someone who had gained some bullshit enlightenment while studying, or
encouraging phrases like ‘You can do it’.

As I read the densely written content about the difference between
transfer for security of circulating collected items and transfer for
security in general terms and the important bone of contention of them…
I felt like I was about to throw up.

On the calendar placed in the corner of the desk, only study plans were
written.

It seemed too late to…

***…Feel the eerie sense of anxiety.***

The Ultimate Weapon Trials mixed the memories of the one taking the
trial, actual events that had occurred, and events that could have
possibly happened…

And by doing so, it created a new world in the person’s mind to devour
their sanity.

For reference, the ultimate weapon itself had no intelligence, let alone
life-like characteristics. However, it had the will and power to perform
its necessary functions.

It was possible that the Obsidian Blade had targeted the existence known
as ‘I’ within Isaac and prepared this shitty stage for the Trial.

“…This is actually fucked.”

I really… didn’t expect this at all.

\*\*\*

Upon leaving the one-room, I was greeted with the sight of a drab
alleyway.

A warning sign that read, ‘No Smoking’, was posted on the building’s
exterior wall. Even so, a smoker had always come here anyway.

Lamp posts that were sparsely seen. Low-rise congregate housing, It was
the living area for Sinlim-dong’s state exam prep students.

It was a familiar sight, but not a welcomed one.

And…

‘Descending Sky.’

To call it an evening sunset… was not correct as the sky emitted a
brilliant topaz hue.

A large scale of rock mana flowed through the sky like the wind. It was
a beautiful scene.

As I had already experienced before in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, that
was the ‘Descending Sky’.

The sky itself was rock that was created through mana.

The sky was slowly descending and eventually, it would flatten this
entire world.

Seeking refuge underground was futile. The moment the sky touched the
ground would be the point in time when my real body was flattened and
obliterated into smithereens by the ceiling.

Suddenly, I saw my reflection in the building’s window.

I was wearing comfortable sweats, an outfit I had worn throughout my
time as a prep student.

And…

“…It’s Isaac.”

It wasn’t my original self who had been worn out by the prep student
lifestyle. Instead, it was Isaac’s appearance.

However, my hair was black.

It felt like nothing about my body had changed… That was good.

I raised my right hand and let mana flow.

A pale blue ice mana flowed from my palm, as little ice crystals began
to float in the air.

There didn’t seem to be any problems with mana.

Next was my status window.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 103

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** (2nd)

**Title:** Prospective Second Year

**Mana:** 24000/24000

– Mana Recovery Speed (B+)

The status window was also the same as before.

Aside from my hair color, physically, I was exactly the same as Level
103 Isaac.

“Come to think of it…”

Ah, I had overlooked something because I kept thinking about the Trial.

I quickly returned to the cramped one-room and turned on the video game
console.

I had always enjoyed ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ as a psychological reward
after studying.

The world in that game had definitely become my reality.

However, in this place, ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was just a game.

Considering the strange events that had happened to me, it was possible
that there was some mysterious secret hidden in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

In other words, this could be an opportunity to catch a glimpse at the
secret parts of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

“What the hell?”

However, the video game screen was filled with static and noise.

The ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ game cartridge was there, but an unknown
force was creating noise and obscuring my view every time I tried to
look at it.

As if it was telling me that it was the one thing I couldn’t look at.

A transcendent power seemed to be acting against me.

“…”

It wasn’t even something new or unexpected to me. I decided not to get
flustered and postpone my questions.

For now, the immediate problem was that, just like the Trial of Frost, I
didn’t know how to pass the Trial of Sandstone.

What were the conditions for passing this Trial?

Since this was also a Trial, the contents would be related to overcoming
a trauma. If that was the case…

‘Perhaps I have to pass the bar exam again…’

***…No. There’s no way that’s it.***

I could easily tell by looking at the calendar and the books spread out
on my desk.

After all, I had been solving practice problems for the first round of
the exam. The second round was still a long way off.

The time given to me was limited. Even if time in the world of the
Ultimate Weapon Trial flowed faster than the real world, the difference
would only be a few months at most.

In the first place, how the fuck am I supposed to do this again? Have
you lost your mind?

“Then, there must be something else.”

I needed to gather information.

I got up from my seat and left the one-room again.

“…?”

***What’s this?***

I noticed something strange after witnessing people on the main road.

I climbed up the pedestrian overpass above the road and stood in front
of the railing. Indeed, the same peculiar phenomenon was happening to
everyone.

“Why is everyone like that?”

They were all gray.

Literally gray.

Their voices could be heard and various expressions were clearly
visible, but all the people were painted in gray, as if they had lost
all their color.

Now was not the time to be surprised.

‘I should try talking to someone.’

I was a bit worried about their heads potentially splitting in two like
in the Trial of Frost, but…

‘Am I in a position to avoid risks?’

I didn’t have time to ponder and worry.

I approached a male in sweats, who was obviously a prep student and
spoke to him.

“Hey there… oh my.”

As I placed my hand on his shoulder, my hand just went through his body.

It felt like I was merely floundering in the air.

It surprised the hell out of me, so I let out a pathetic lamentation.

It seemed as if even my voice couldn’t be heard, as the male continued
to walk in an unmoved manner.

“After all I’ve went through, I’m even a ghost now…?”

I couldn’t help but laugh wryly.

***Seriously?***

“I can touch other things though?”

The cold and solid sensation of the railing of the pedestrian overpass
could be distinctly felt.

I deduced that I was being treated like a ghost by gray existences. How
absurd.

In conclusion, I was not a complete ghost.

***Am I more of a poltergeist?***

‘That is…’

***So sweet.***

Of course, I didn’t have the time to go wherever I wanted and shake
various things while enjoying the sight of people being startled.

“First, this trial…”

Ah.

I lost strength in my legs.

I sat down, gripping onto the railing.

I could guess the reason. Despite pretending to be all bright and happy,
I fucking hated this scenery.

In my prep student lifestyle… In the desolate darkness of an endless
tunnel…

I despised the feeling of isolation that I had experienced for years.

Although those days had settled in my mind as nostalgic memories after
my prep student lifestyle had ended…

It seemed like the current me was fully experiencing the feeling of
exhaustion and fatigue I felt back then.

“I’m gonna lose my fucking mind…”

My stomach churned and I felt as if I was about to vomit.

“Haah.”

After closing my eyes and taking a deep breath, I finally got up.

***Pull yourself together.***

I slapped my cheeks with both hands.

I needed to figure out how to pass this Trial.

I have to find a hint about an unusual occurrence in this world;
something that was different from my memories.

Underneath the Descending Sky…

I began to walk once again.

\* \* \*

“So this is how it felt. I can finally feel it now.”

Märchen Academy, high in the sky above the clouds.

Amidst the cluster of stars shimmering with various colors, a female
student sat cross-legged, floating steadily in the air.

A witch hat was worn on her head. Only the end of her long light purple
hair was tied up. It was Dorothy Heartnova.

As if she had gained enlightenment after closing her eyes and
meditating, she broke into a mischievous smile.

\[Did you feel something?\]

As Ella, a white cat familiar who was also floating high in the sky with
the power of starlight mana, asked, Dorothy nodded

From what Dorothy could feel, her abilities had become a level stronger.

Just moments ago, she had sensed an unusual event that happened in this
world and had observed the birth of another worldline.

And now, she was confident that she could meddle in that world.

“Nihihi. I’ll be back, Ella”

The stage that the extraordinary genius, Dorothy Heartnova, would have
reached in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ if she hadn’t died.

The result of Isaac defying fate itself to prevent the inevitability of
her death, no matter how many playthroughs of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱
were taken.

At this very moment, something that should never have happened was about
to unfold.

Ella smiled with a giggle.

\[Okay. I’ll see you soon, Dorothy.\]

The power of \[All In the World\] merged with starlight mana, as Dorothy
emitted a radiant brilliance.

Chapter 120: Monologue (3)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (3) ༻**

The State Exam Prep Students’ Tower of Trials.

Although there was a study room on the 5th floor, that title was the
nickname for the building in the floors below it, from the 1st to 4th
floor; Respectively on each floor, there was a billiards room, an
internet cafe, a comic book rental store, and a karaoke room.

I could hear people vigorously tapping at their keyboards, engrossed in
their games. Of course, they were all gray.

‘There’s nothing special here.’

There wasn’t a game that I hadn’t seen before and browsing the news on
the internet didn’t reveal any noteworthy issues.

The real-time search terms on the portal site were just full of
celebrities and political issues.

Even though the sky was falling, the world seemed to be running just
fine.

I tried to look up ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ in the search bar. As
expected, only static and noise occurred and the search term couldn’t
even be seen.

When I instinctively searched and pressed Enter, this time, the entire
computer screen was covered in noise.

It felt like something similar to Providence was severely restricting
any information related to ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

“Ugh.”

***So fucking stingy…***

It seemed like the internet was going to be of little use.

◆ ◆ ◆

Even as time passed, nothing noteworthy happened.

I didn’t feel hungry, despite not having eaten, and I wasn’t sleepy
either, even though it became night.

In no time at all, the Descending Sky had fallen to a third of its
original position. In terms of time, it had only been 2 days since this
trial began.

I devised various methods in a sober state.

With my robust body, I tried getting lightly hit by a car and I created
a huge lump of ice in an attempt to attract people’s attention.

However, that was all I could do. I hadn’t even found a hint of a clue
for the conditions of clearing this trial.

“…Ah.”

I was wandering around, formulating numerous hypotheses.

As I was crammed into the crowd at the side of the street, my stomach
suddenly began to churn.

State exam prep student lifestyle. The scenery made it seem like this
world was solely excluding me.

*That feeling.*

As the sensation of *that time* was recalled vividly, nausea overwhelmed
me. It was uncontrollable.

I rushed to the public restroom at the train station and vomited into
the toilet.

“Haaa, phew…”

After barely calming my stomach and flushing the toilet…

I washed my face at the sink and left the restroom.

“…I’m fucked.”

Not just people, but even objects.

Everything reflected upon my eyes was gradually dyed in that accursed
black and white.

I already knew it all. This was just the Trial of Sandstone. It was just
a fake world designed to devour my sanity.

However, the sensations I had felt during this time of my life were
vividly recalled, making it so fucking difficult to endure.

I hurried back to my one-room apartment at Sinlim-dong.

Briquette-shaped keyring, the hourglass, the marimo, the legal
literature; these were the only things not dyed in black and white.

“Eden!”

I tried to summon my familiar, but I didn’t even get a response.

Only then did I realize that my own arms were now dyed gray.

◆ ◆ ◆

Time passed.

Just as it was before, nothing had happened.

The only change was that the world I saw now was completely
monochromatic.

It was a sight that felt like an old black-and-white TV had replaced a
color TV.

At least the Descending Sky maintained its original color.

Before I knew it, that sky had already descended half-way.

However, even now, I still couldn’t grasp a single hint of the clearing
conditions for this trial.

“…”

I walked along Sinlim-dong’s streets.

I could feel myself becoming more withdrawn.

I at least wanted to visit the company that created ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, but when I tried searching the corporate name to find its
address, the screen was filled with noise; It was utterly maddening.

The only silver lining was that even though objects had turned
monochromatic, I could still touch them.

There was a drawback because of the lack of detailed sensations.

But still, it was fortunate that I had not been completely cut off from
this world yet.

◆ ◆ ◆

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** ???

**Gender:** ?

**Year:** ?

**Title:** ??????

**Mana:** 500 / 500

– ?? Recovery Speed (??)

The sky had gotten quite close.

I estimated that within the next three days, this world would meet its
end.

However, my vision still only reflected colorless landscapes.

And I still couldn’t even guess what the conditions for clearing this
trial could possibly be.

A cramped one-room. I sat quietly in the corner. I was thinking.

What should I do? What in the world did I have to do in order to
overcome this trial?

As I pondered and pondered while glancing around, a black and white
calendar on the desk suddenly caught my eye.

As I realized what today’s date was, both my eyes widened.

I couldn’t do anything besides quietly stare at the calendar, as if time
had stopped.

September 23rd.

Today was the anniversary of my mother’s death.

\*\*\*

There was a place I really wanted to go.

Even if it was a fake world, I didn’t wish to go there in sweats, so I
dressed up nicely.

A white shirt, blue jacket, and black pants. Of course, it all just
appeared black and white. Fortunately, the sizes all fit me fairly well.

The wind wasn’t too chilly, but it wasn’t too hot either.

I took the subway and arrived at the Columbarium.

Inside a glass cabinet was a small urn. a bouquet of flowers, and a
framed photograph.

In the photograph, smiling awkwardly in embarrassment…

A woman more lovely than anyone else could be seen.

“It’s been a while.”

***Mom.***

If I traced back my memories, I truly was a stupid bastard.

I had turned off my smartphone and fully engrossed myself in books, all
for the sake of my, oh so important, studies. As such, I only found out
about my mother’s passing much later on.

In the uninteresting play that I had a role in, my prep student life was
like a monologue.

A sensation of being isolated from the world.

Buried in books, I was doing all kinds of useless bullshit on my own, as
I ran aimlessly towards an uncertain future.

Although the hollow passage of time did help me regain the strength
needed to move forward…

The emotions I felt when I heard about my mother’s passing never
improved even until the moment I passed the state exam.

After the admission ceremony of the Judicial Research and Training
Institute concluded, I visited the Columbarium with my certificate of
appointment in hand.

I wanted to share the news with a smile, ‘Isn’t your son truly
incredible, Mom?’

However, when I saw my mother’s picture, it felt like my heart was being
torn apart. I had to crouch here for a long time, only sobbing without
any words.

I closed my eyes. For a moment, I quietly took a deep breath.

I opened my eyes again and imprinted the picture of my mother even more
vividly in my mind.

I began to walk.

Leaving the Columbarium, I took the rattling subway back to Sinlim-dong.

I looked out the subway window at the sky.

The sky had come much closer. Compared to the beginning, it seemed like
two-thirds of it had descended now.

The beautiful colors that the rock mana radiated were incredibly vivid
in this monochromatic world.

Death was rapidly approaching.

This wretched scenery was pressing down on me like a weight.

The effects of \[Frozen Soul\] helped calm me somewhat, but with just
that much, nothing could be solved.

◆ ◆ ◆

When I arrived at Sinlim-dong, I headed towards the pedestrian overpass.

I leaned against the railing, silently watching the cars pass by with
loud noises.

A colorless scenery.

Looking back, it wasn’t even that novel.

After all, during my state exam life, the scenery reflected upon my eyes
was originally this dull.

“…”

I could not lose myself.

So, I lit \[Frostfire\] in my right hand.

For some reason, my mana had significantly decreased, but I could still
barely maintain \[Frostfire\].

The chilly mana blazing like flames also appeared black and white.

Although I couldn’t feel any sensation, looking at those frigid flames
actually made me feel like I was still alive.

Time passed again…

And as my mana depleted, \[Frostfire\] flickered out like an exhausted
matchstick.

I had been pondering deeply throughout my time here, but I still had no
idea how to clear this trial.

At least in the Trial of Frost, the Evil God resurrected, ending the
world. If it was something like that, how could I not know what the
conditions were?

However, here, I was simply isolated.

***Nothing more.***

***Nothing less.***

Even so, I had no intention of giving up.

I didn’t despair. On the contrary, I was more determined than ever.

If I were a flower, I would bloom even in a mire filled with filth.

I softly closed, then opened my eyes, taking a moment to hone my
emotions before quietly starting to move forward.

With that, I fired up my will.

Then, at that moment…

A dull thud echoed, as something collided with the railings of the
overpass.

Simultaneously, an elegant and pure sound that should not be heard in
this muted world chimed.

“…?”

I stopped and turned my head back to the railings where the sound came
from.

And my jaws dropped.

In the world dyed in black and white, only one girl sparkled, rousing a
cluster of stars of various colors.

Her posture indicated she had fallen from the sky and landed on the
railing. Her light purple hair, tied only at the end, momentarily
floated in the air.

“Gosh.”

She pressed her witch hat to prevent it from flying away…

And then jumped off the railing, facing me.

When she did so, her cheeks turned rosy as she smiled widely, revealing
her pearly white teeth.

“I finally found you.”

At that moment, my composure vanished and my chest tightened so much
that my face crumpled like a sheet of paper.

However, after taking a deep breath and exhaling, I barely managed to
control my expression so it didn’t distort.

“Senior…”

The person who had shone endlessly bright to me was now right before my
eyes.

“President. Do you know what I went through to find you? I was exhausted
to death! Now, I’ll give you a chance! Come on, why don’t you come and
comfort this Big Sis\~?

While raising her hand to her chest, Dorothy wore a playful smile.

I had no idea how she appeared in front of my eyes.

However…

\[Dorothy Heartnova\] **Lv:** 183

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Rock, Starlight

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[★☆★☆With☆★☆★☆★\]

It wasn’t difficult at all to realize that she was real.

<span id="0119_121_Monologue_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 121: Monologue (4)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (4) ༻**

“How are you here…?”

“Hmm.”

Dorothy stroked her chin, observing me intently.

\[All In the World\] and \[Emotional Insight\]. It was impossible to
hide one’s inner thoughts and feelings from her.

Perhaps her eyes could discern my state even more clearly than I could.

“…”

Dorothy let out a soft smile before playfully grinning and rushing
towards me.

“Nah, whatever! Comforting can come later! Let’s go!”

“Huh…? Uahk!”

Dorothy grabbed my wrist and dashed towards the overpass stairs.

The weak but compelling force generated by her starlight mana pushed at
my back.

To avoid stumbling, I had no choice but to be forcibly pulled along by
her.

“S-Senior?! Where are we going?!”

“Anywhere is fine!!”

With her remaining hand, Dorothy pressed down her witch hat firmly to
prevent it from flying away.

We descended the overpass stairs with haste, practically skipping over
the steps.

A black and white world. Without hesitation, we crossed the street where
people dyed in gray moved about.

“Let’s go anywhere!”

While running, Dorothy turned her head towards me, revealing her white
teeth and bright smile.

A burst of laughter suddenly escaped from my lips.

I bit my numb lower lip for a brief moment then laughed once again
before being pulled along by her.

After all, this girl, the sole person who hadn’t lost her color, looked
so radiant.

I was once again reminded why I had liked her so much during my previous
life as a State Exam prep student.

\*\*\*

I shared several stories with Dorothy.

Along with the story about the hidden ultimate weapons in Märchen
Academy, I explained that this place was a part of the trial given by
the rock weapon.

I also debriefed her on the current situation; I still hadn’t figured
out the conditions for passing this trial and instead, my situation had
worsened as my body turned gray.

And I passed over certain things, as if implying that we could discuss
the details later.

─‘Senior, how in the world did you get here…?’

When I asked as such, Dorothy spun an unbelievable tale.

She could vaguely observe countless worldlines…

And since her ability had grown stronger, she had now reached a level
where she could even intervene in these other worldlines.

I was already familiar with the observation part.

***Can one call themselves a true fan if they can’t even recite their
favorite character’s settings by heart?***

However, her ability to intervene was entirely new to me.

‘That’s insane…’

Dorothy was a terrifying existence beyond imagination.

Although the Zelver Empire had praised her as a rare genius who would
reach the level of an Archwizard within ten years…

She was not at a level that could be gauged by mere human intelligence.

Dorothy explained how she had deduced the connection between my unusual
actions and the sudden appearance of a new and peculiar worldline, thus
deciding to intervene in this world.

This was a domain far beyond my comprehension… But the only thing in my
mind was just how amazing Dorothy was.

Dorothy casually removed the clothes from a department store mannequin
and went to the dressing room to change.

Out of all these people, not a single one paid any attention to her.

Surprisingly, anything she touched would have its color restored. They
returned to black and white when she moved away, though.

“How do I look, President?”

A long shirt, short pants, and a neat cardigan that slid down her
shoulders.

An attire reminiscent of the modern era.

All the clothes she wore had been restored to their original colors.

She had tucked away her original clothes in her magic pocket.

‘Big Sis, you’re gonna be the end of me.’

She was quite literally a walking photo shoot.

“It’s perfect.”

“Nihihi.”

When I serenely gave a thumbs-up, Dorothy laughed merrily and made a V
sign with her index and middle fingers.

Earlier, when Dorothy had held my wrist and ran at the overpass, I had
remained unchangingly gray.

Even when she placed her hand on my shoulder as an experiment, nothing
was different. My color did not return.

The same was true when touching the shoulder of a female department
store employee. For reference, Dorothy was able to touch other people.

Anyway, her influence didn’t seem to extend to people. It was quite
disappointing.

We walked along the streets of Sinlim-dong.

Dorothy was euphoric, exclaiming ‘So sweet!’ while she had a lollipop
stolen from the convenience store in her mouth.

***How ecstatic is she?***

Her voice was drenched with excitement.

“Stealing clothes, dining and dashing. Nihihi, we’re total desperados!
Doesn’t this have a certain romance to it?”

Dorothy held the lollipop in her mouth and murmured.

A joyful voice. As expected of the juvenile delinquent who boasted the
most demerits in Märchen Academy.

“I’m not sure about the romance, but it is comfortable.”

“Righhht\~? But, President. Is this the world you used to live in?”

“Yes. It looked like this.”

“President, you really are beyond imagination. I could never have
guessed that you came from a completely different world.”

From Dorothy’s perspective, it was understandable for her to be
astounded that I was from another world.

But putting that aside…

“…Senior, how did you find me?”

“I sensed your mana. I searched everywhere, you see. I was able to find
you by focusing all my strength on only mana perception.”

A tranquil tone.

She had mentioned earlier that she was exhausted to death because she
was trying so hard to find me.

Not long after the Trial of Sandstone began, she had probably detected
the small amount of mana I had momentarily released, thus narrowing her
search to Korea.

And thanks to the \[Frostfire\] I had released for quite a while, she
had sensed the minuscule amount of mana and eventually located me.

“…”

It made me somber. I felt really sorry…

“Well then! Let’s assess the situation.”

At that moment, Dorothy clapped her hands, as if to signal for me to
focus only on her and not think about anything else.

As she did so, she stopped her feet and gazed at the sky filled with
rock mana.

“The sky is falling and at this rate, it’ll all be over within three
days. President has turned gray like the other people. You can’t feel
anything even when you touch something and you don’t feel like you’re
still alive…”

‘What the f- Why does she feel so dependable?’

Dorothy was actually assessing the situation…!

***Is this really the same Dorothy who got dizzy just from using her
head a little?***

“President, for now, you see!”

Did she already find a solution?

“Yes.”

I swallowed dryly and listened carefully to her words.

“Let’s play.”

***…What?***

\*\*\*

In a way, Dorothy’s suggestion had its merits.

The Trial of Sandstone created this world based on my own traumas.

The reason the world’s scenery and my body had started turning gray was
definitely because the feeling of isolation and social withdrawal during
this point in time became more severe.

So, if we played around and had as much fun as we wanted to make me feel
better, there was a possibility that my condition would improve

As such…

“All the songs of this world are lying in wait in this cramped space,
right?! Oh, President? What’s this box? It keeps changing, eh?!”

We arrived at coin karaoke.

The reason for this was that Dorothy, who particularly loved songs,
wanted to fully enjoy what this world had to offer.

…I did have a reasonable suspicion that perhaps her suggestion was just
because she wanted to sing, though.

Once she entered the booth and saw the karaoke machine, Dorothy was very
amazed. It kinda felt like I became a dad who brought his little
daughter to see the world.

“Senior, don’t you not know these songs?”

“I heard this and that while wandering around. It was so fascinating\~.
I liked the songs here!”

It was quite common to hear songs while walking down the street.

It seemed that while Dorothy had traveled around Korea to look for me,
she had stopped at times to enjoy various songs.

If Dorothy was Korean, she would have definitely dreamed of becoming a
singer.

After all, she had extraordinary memorization and talent when it came to
singing.

“What’s this funny-looking stick?”

“It’s a mic. Uhhh, a speaker.”

“Ah Ah–.

“Ooooh!”

When Dorothy held the microphone and made some sounds, her beautiful
voice resonated within the space. It was funny to see her amazement.

Dorothy and I sat side by side in the narrow booth and chatted.

It was so fun to see Dorothy fascinated by modern culture.

“Ah, President. Do you know this song?”

Dorothy cleared her throat and hummed a single syllable.

I recognized it instantly and pressed the remote control button to play
the strong.

**「Violet Fragrance – Kang Susie」**

As the music started to play, filling the booth, Dorothy’s head flinched
in bewilderment, However, she soon got excited, blushing and smiling
brightly at me.

She immediately stood up, holding the mic in both hands.

In the karaoke room, the awkward atmosphere that usually existed for the
first song had spread.

And the karaoke machine started playing a random music video.

‘What’s that? Why are strange people and animals appearing?”

“Just ignore it.”

“O-okay…!”

Eventually, the first verse appeared on the screen.

Dorothy seemed like she couldn’t understand the lyrics displayed on the
machine, but it didn’t seem to matter to her.

Dorothy took a deep breath and closed her eyes with a smile.

Then… 3, 2, 1.

“You came to me gently\~ like a violet light\~.”

*Ooooh…!*

Suddenly, my heart pounded as my fist clenched.

As Dorothy’s beautiful singing turned into a flowing melody, my sense of
hearing was given a feeling of immense satisfaction.

*Whew.* Even though I didn’t have a sense of touch, it was such a relief
that I could still see, hear, and smell…!

‘My ears are getting blessed…!’

*Heup.*

I blocked my mouth. It felt like I was being moved to tears.

***After all, her gestures may be dainty, but she was fucking
beautiful…!***

“You wereeeeee\~!! The one who gave me\~ love\~!”

Even her high notes were perfect.

As I cheered, Dorothy extended her arm towards me, making a V sign with
her index and middle fingers.

Her bashful smile looked so delighted that it lifted my spirits as well.

Soon after, Dorothy’s rendition of 「Violet Fragrance – Kang Susie」
ended and the karaoke machine displayed a score of 97 points.

This impertinent bitch of a machine dared to give Dorothy’s performance
a score that wasn’t a perfect 100 points?

***How fucking dense and stupid can it be?***

“Nyahaha! That was fun!”

***…You’re lucky Dorothy’s happy. Thanks to her, you’ll live to see
another day.***

“Senior, I’ll sing too.”

“President, isn’t this the first time you’re going to sing in front of
me?”

“I wasn’t familiar with the songs from that world. I know these ones
well.”

“Nihihi, okay!”

I got up and played 「Trip To Myself – Buzz」.

I was planning to sing all the songs I had listened to whenever I had a
tough time during my prep student life.

A familiar bass sound.

Followed by the explosive drums and electric guitar.

Now, 3, 2, 1.

“If! You run to the end of that blue seaaa\~!”

“Oooh, Presidennnnt! Oh myyyyy\~!”

“Over there with a horseee\~!”

***Yes! This is it!***

The feeling of suffocation, akin to a clogged toilet, burst as it was
released from my stifled emotions.

Just like how I did, Dorothy excitedly moved her body up and down,
following the beat.

And at the highlight section, when I grabbed onto my stomach and shouted
with excessively excited gestures, she exploded into laughter.

After finishing the first verse and moving on to the second, she joined
in, immediately grasping the mood of the song.

We danced together and in the highlight, we screamed the high notes
together.

“”Far away you’re my sunshine! We were together\~!!””

I was grinning because it was so much fun. I listened as Dorothy’s
laughter mixed with the sound of the music.

And so, we stomped our feet, jumping around like lunatics.

And as Dorothy, who somehow knew various songs, sang famous hits in her
own style…

I also sang all the songs that had comforted me during my prep student
life to my heart’s content.

It was a lot of fun.

◆ ◆ ◆

***Agh, my throat hurts.***

But well, it was still fun.

Though, I shouldn’t be saying such things while looking at the scenery
of the world ending.

“That was so much fun! What did you think, President? Have your ears
been blessed?”

“Yes. I seriously think that even if I die today, I won’t have any
regrets.”

“Good! That’s a perfect answer!”

Even though she had belted out so many high notes, Dorothy’s voice was
still perfectly fine.

Of course it was. Why wouldn’t it be? Would a goddess lose her voice
just from singing a song made by a human? Of course not.

We arrived at the park and sat side by side on a bench, gazing at the
Descending Sky.

My body was quite stiff and heavy now. It felt like I couldn’t move
freely anymore.

It seemed the petrifaction of my real body had progressed tremendously.

“President.”

“Yes.”

“If you were to die today, what would you want to do?”

Where did that even come from…? And what kind of question was that…?

“Isn’t that a bit of an inauspicious question….?”

***Don’t foreshadow so ominously…***

“Still, the scenery of a world ending like this is not something you can
easily see wherever you go, right? It’s not a bad idea to immerse
ourselves in our emotions at a time like this.”

“…What does Senior want to do?”

“Eating chicken while watching the world meet its end?”

“Why chicken?”

“It’s delicious.”

At such a one-dimensional answer, I was speechless for a moment.

Of course, I agreed with the fact that chicken was delicious, though.

“What about President?”

“I haven’t thought about it. After all, I don’t plan on dying just yet.”

“…You’re no fun.”

Dorothy giggled but didn’t continue the conversation.

We sat in silence for a while.

And suddenly, something soft and supple burrowed between my fingers.

“…?”

I turned my head and looked towards my hand that had felt such a
sensation.

Dorothy was holding my hand, which I had set down on the bench, her
fingers interlocked with mine.

As I dumbfoundedly looked towards Dorothy, her bright smile, shining
like starlight, was reflected upon my eyes.

“Now you can feel a sense of touch, right? I was just trying it out as
an experiment.”

“…”

“President, your color has returned.”

A world dyed in black and white.

Before I knew it, my body, just like Dorothy’s, had regained its
original color.

Chapter 122: Monologue (5)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (5) ༻**

◆ ◆ ◆

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 103

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** (2nd)

**Title:** Prospective Second Year

**Mana:** 23880/24000

– Mana Recovery Speed (B+)

I bit my thumb.

The sensation of my teeth sinking nto it could be felt vividly.

I lowered my bitten finger and blinked slowly.

“Since when was it? I mean when I returned to this state.”

“You got gradually better at the karaoke and now you’re completely
back.”

“Why didn’t you say anything?”

“Well, I just wanted to observe the situation for a bit. President’s
will power and stuff is good so I thought it would get better quickly.”

“…”

***I feel like I’m losing energy…***

Dorothy’s nonsensical proposal regarding how I should just play a ton
seemed to have a much larger effect than I had expected. The reason I
turned gray was probably because I felt isolated.

Since entering the Trial of Sandstone, I had been doing nothing more
than marching along the same path I had already traversed during my time
as a prep student. After all, I lived alone, isolated from everyone
else.

However, because of this girl, akin to a refreshing breeze, I didn’t
even have a chance to get lost in that feeling.

It was a simple solution that perfectly suited my exam life. Thinking of
a solution was only a headache for me, but…

‘It felt like Dorothy literally grabbed me by the collar and pulled me
out of that abyss.’

Even so, only my body had regained its color. The world was still
monochromatic, so I hadn’t even returned to the starting point yet.

***Putting that aside though…***

“Uh, do we have to keep holding hands?”

***This is so embarrassing…***

“It’s fan service. You don’t like it?”

“No, I asked because I like it a bit too much.”

“Nihihi.”

I couldn’t believe I could hold the soft hand of a goddess. I liked it
because it felt like we were a couple.

In that state, I was lost in thought. Thanks to Dorothy, I had a sliver
of a clue to solve this situation…

***To not be ostracized in this world.***

If I smashed apart this world without abandon, making me an existence
that no one could ignore…

It was possible that the world would return to its original colors and I
could overcome this trial. It was a violent method, but it was worth a
try.

***…However, there’s no way that things will go as smoothly as I
thought.***

\[External variable has intruded and greatly influenced the Trial of
Sandstone!\]

‘What the?’

Suddenly, a system window popped up in front of me.

***External variable intrusion?***

“Huh…?”

In succession, Dorothy’s hand, which I had been holding, disappeared
like a collapsing sandcastle. I hadn’t lost my senses again. It was just
that there was nothing to hold at all.

I looked at Dorothy again. Her body… It was turning into sparkling
stardust and disappearing.

“Senior?!”

Dorothy looked down at her hands that had already disappeared, making an
expression full of meaning.

It was a calm expression, almost as if she had already known this would
happen.

“Nihihi, I seem to have overexerted a bit. I can’t hold on any longer.”

It seemed as if she had already been aware of her body’s condition, as
Dorothy sheepishly smiled.

A transcendental ability that allowed her to intervene in other
worldlines. No matter how one thought of it, it was absolutely ludicrous
to think that such an ability could be easy to utilize.

Dorothy had been overexerting herself for me.

\[Conclusion: \[Gormos’ Obsidian Blade\] is readjusting the Trial of
Sandstone.\]

“President.”

Before I knew it, half of Dorothy’s body had already disappeared.

However, she stared at my face intently, as if she wanted to see me even
just a little bit longer.

“I had so much fun today. Because you were there with me.”

Dorothy smiled softly.

“That’s why you have to come back, okay?”

“…Yes, of course.”

And then, she disappeared completely.

Stardust fluttered in the wind, leaving an afterimage in my field of
vision as it lingered. Dorothy seemed to have returned to her original
world.

I was only thankful to Dorothy. Thanks to her, I was able to solve the
most infuriating task.

However, looking at the contents of the system window…

Gormos’s Greatsword or, ‘Obsidian Blade’, seemed to have recognized the
impact that the variable known as Dorothy had on me.

It looked like it was planning to adjust the trial content anew, as much
as she had intervened. The difficulty would probably increase
significantly.

‘I acknowledge it.”

This was the middle of a trial to become the owner of an ultimate
weapon. It was absurd if I could pass the Trial of Sandstone and become
the owner of the Obsidian Blade through Dorothy’s help.

Seeing the still descending sky, it didn’t seem like the trial itself
was going to initialize. The plan was to probably make the remaining
time left much more difficult.

‘And my trauma…’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the purpose of all trials were ultimately
the same. It was to overcome trauma. This trial would be no different.

However, besides my prep student life, was there anything that I could
call a trauma? Maybe getting rejected after confessing to a girl I liked
in high school? Flipping over a pot of well-cooked ramen right as I was
about to eat it? Honestly, the things that came to mind were only at
that level.

“…?”

Suddenly, dense and dark ash powder intruded into my field of vision.

As I raised my head, large amounts of ash swirled in the wind, unfolding
a vast spectacle. What was all this?

It got up from the bench and observed the cityscape.

The numerous buildings filling the city were gradually turning into ash
from the top down, burned by black flames. It was not so much burning as
it was a flame that ‘annihilated’.

At the same time, a complex and pitch-black shape of something, akin to
the darkness of the universe, was emerging from various places,
encroaching space.

“Why is that…?”

***Where are those flames and black shapes appearing?***

This was something I had frequently seen in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱
and had witnessed with my own two eyes during the Trial of Frost; It was
the magic of Evil God Nephid…!

‘It’s reusing the Evil God in this place?’

***Is it fucking crazy?***

*Kuoooooo───!!*

“The fuck?!”

Even the ground was collapsing…?!

This wasn’t the time to be lost in thought. I began to flee.

I looked around. The desperate screams of gray people who were crossing
the street. They were either annihilated in an instant by the black
flames, falling beneath the collapsing ground, or being devoured by the
black spheres.

‘What should I do?!’

What kind of madness was it to reuse the Evil God right after
readjusting the trial? Was it planning to just go fast and furious now?

Where was the Evil God? Why was the Evil God’s magic appearing here in
the first place…

*Crash──!*

When I looked back, the ground behind me was sinking, as the solid heap
of soil collapsed!

***Think. Think fast. I need to find a way to survive here. Please,
neurons, do your job!***

◆◆◆

“Keuk…!”

A groan burst forth. My body just had to become excessively heavy at
this moment. A part of my body had turned to stone. It seemed like a
substantial amount of my vitality had been depleted.

However, I exerted all my strength and desperately avoided the
collapsing ground, running for my life.

And then…

*Kuoooooo───!!*

“Uwak!”

The earth shook like crazy.

Before I could fall, I quickly created a rock with \[Rock Generation\]
to anchor myself.

Scratches appeared on the road before it cracked and broke apart. I
couldn’t stop moving.

A high-intensity earthquake. Even the burning skyscrapers easily came
tumbling down.

And…

“…!!”

I felt a dense mana that pressed on my skin. It felt like just the mana
itself could crush me with its sheer force.

A mana that easily surpassed even the Floating Island, Cavallion the
Earthshaker.

“The Evil God? No wait… What’s that?”

It wasn’t the Evil God.

It was a different type of mana from what I had felt during the Trial of
Frost. I had no way of knowing what it was, but it felt strangely
familiar, like déjà vu.

A drop of cold sweat trickled down my cheek. I clenched my teeth and
while gasping, I swallowed hard and looked towards the epicenter that
emitted this tremendous mana.

I didn’t know where it was, but it was certainly very far away.

*Kwanggggg─────────!!!!*

From there, a navy blue light rose terrifyingly, like a volcanic
eruption. How flashy. It was probably the light of a magic circle.

High in the sky, a wave of dark blue mana spread. It extended in all
directions like ripples and swept over my head. As a result, the light
that had filled the city abruptly disappeared and the Republic of Korea
was shrouded in an alien black light.

Soon after, something received the light of the magic circle and
revealed itself on the surface.

It was something with an extremely obese build.

\[■■■…\]

A strange voice echoed in the atmosphere. I couldn’t understand what it
was saying at all.

Moreover, I couldn’t check what the owner of the voice looked like.

*Bzzzzzzzz──.*

Because noise enveloped that creature.

Almost as if it was an existence that shouldn’t be seen.

‘It’s not a demon.’

Although I couldn’t detect demons at a far distance…

If their mana leaked into my perception range, I could sense them. I had
learned this during the Trial of Frost, thanks to the Evil God.

‘So what in the world is it…’

I tried to open the status window, but…

\[ ※ Unable to check the information! \]

Even the status window couldn’t uncover a single scrap of information.

Whether it was Dorothy, Alice, the Primordial Beast that transcended
death, or even the Evil God, who was my final goal… It may have been
limited, but the status window had still appeared.

That creature seemed to be fundamentally different from all the
existences I had seen until now. It meant that it was hiding some sort
of secret.

Furthermore, the problem was that I couldn’t even speculate what it was.

By all means, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there was nothing more
dangerous than the Evil God. Was it a hidden last boss? No, there was no
way that was the case. After all, even as a ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱
tryhard, I had never seen anything like that.

It seemed that the noise couldn’t completely conceal that creature, as
from time to time, small gaps opened and closed, revealing parts of it.
Each time it did so, I saw skin with unclassifiable color and numerous
eyes embedded thickly.

Suddenly, an unbelievable possibility crossed my mind.

Whenever I tried to see something related to ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
noise occurred and the same phenomenon was happening with that gigantic
form.

‘That meant…’

That being was not an existence from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

However, that being was an existence related to ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

That being was probably an existence that belonged in the land of the
Republic of Korea.

And it appeared when this world was facing its end. Almost as if it had
been shackled up until that point.

I suddenly had a thought.

Why did noise occur for ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱?

The world and people appearing ashy were related to my trauma. However,
there was no reason for ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ to be affected.

In other words, the one causing the noise was separate from my trauma.
Could it be that it was… that monster?

“…!”

At that moment, a cheerful sound effect rang in my ears. I was so tense
that I jumped in surprise.

In front of me, there was a system window.

“What’s this…?’

After looking at that system window, I stood stiff, as I did not
understand the situation for a while.

\[\[The Evil God of Destruction Nephid\] has brought forth the end of
all worlds.\] \[Survive until the initialization.\] \[Loading…\] \[1%\]

\*\*\*

\[2%\]

\*\*\*

<span id="0121_123_Monologue_6.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 123: Monologue (6)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (6) ༻**

Let’s organize the situation.

After Dorothy had recovered my color, she could not endure the side
effects of intervening in a different worldline and got sent back.

Subsequently, a system window appeared. The contents of it were that an
external variable, Dorothy, had heavily influenced the Trial of
Sandstone, so the Obsidian Blade would readjust the trial.

Then abruptly, the world started to fall apart due to the Evil God’s
magic, and a distant unidentifiable monster had popped out.

After that, the system window displayed these contents; To survive until
the initialization, as the Evil God Nephid had brought forth the end of
all worlds.

Moreover, now, even a loading screen was progressing that aimed to
initialize something.

Contextually, initializing in this fucked world probably meant returning
to the past…

***…But when exactly?***

Ugh, my brain was scrambled.

‘Why is something like this popping up?’

***In the first place, what does any of this have to do with my
trauma?***

***Isn’t the main purpose of all trials to overcome trauma?***

…Whatever. I could only make reasonable judgments right now. The ground
had collapsed and the Evil God’s rain of flames was pouring down, so I
had to save my immediately unanswerable suspicions for later.

Either way, the given goal was crystal clear. To survive until the
initialization finished loading.

Before long, this world would meet its complete demise.

There was nowhere to flee. No matter where I went, I would die.

The problem was… the initialization was loading way too fucking slowly.
It didn’t seem like it would finish loading before this world
disappeared.

“…Aht!”

The rain of black flames flew towards me and stuck onto my left arm;
Even if I evaded all types of threats, it was impossible to avoid all of
them.

The black flames annihilated my hand in an instant and began to climb up
my arm at a rapid pace.

*Kwaaaaa────!!*

I didn’t have a chance to feel hesitation nor fear. With the belief that
my magic would affect it, I blew apart my left arm with a rough \[Frost
Explosion\] before the black flames could surge upwards.

The explosion of ice mana easily flung away my left arm…

As the arm floated in the air, it was devoured by the black flames and
futilely became mere ashes and dust before vanishing.

“Keuuuk…!”

***It hurts. It fucking hurts so bad.***

An intense, agonizing heat surged at my shoulder.

Thanks to the ice freezing solidly at the cross-section of my shoulder,
no blood was leaking. In order to endure the pain, I aggressively bit my
lower lips and continued to run away. From my lips, the metallic taste
of blood filled my mouth.

Fortunately, thanks to the effects of \[Frozen Soul\], I could maintain
rational thinking even in this sort of situation. Except for the
drawback that I could feel the pain even more vividly, it really was a
relief that I had it.

‘Think fast…!’

I had to survive in this world until the loading finished. However, the
end of this world was approaching much faster than the loading was
finishing.

***Is there a way to survive?***

“…”

Suddenly, the gigantic existence that continued to release dark blue
ripples caught my eye. Although it was enveloped in noise, at times, the
noise could not hide its entire body. As such, from those sporadic gaps,
dozens of alien eyes, seemingly not of this world, were revealed.

“…!”

Soon after, a thought crossed my mind.

‘How did I not realize this way before?’

That unidentifiable monster in and of itself was a hint. Although I
didn’t know where that bastard lived and who it was, the phenomenon that
was occurring to it gave me the answer.

The place I arrived after desperately running was…

*Kwaa─!*

***The one-room.***

Even the time needed to unlock the door was precious, so I blew it away
with a small \[Frost Explosion\] before entering.

Since the buildings making up the city were becoming ash from the top
down, the semi-basement one-room I lived in had yet to disappear.

I flung away the heap of books that were taller than myself and turned
on the game console that took up a small space in this cramped room. As
always, ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was inserted into this game console.

The screen showed static as it created noise. Unconcerned, I held the
controller with my remaining hand and sat down.

“I did think it was weird.”

Noise, that fucking noise. Because it had only let out sounds of static,
I believed for sure that ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ could not be played.

It was even covering my sight, so there was no way that they wouldn’t be
able to deceive my hearing as well.

In the internet cafe, although the information was covered when
searching for ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the screen itself was
completely fine.

At this moment in time, the noise had also covered the unidentifiable
monster that had appeared somewhere in the Republic of Korea. Still,
putting that noise aside, the monster was undoubtedly there in its
physical form.

In other words, ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ would also work completely
fine because it was still there.

‘I don’t know if this is the answer.’

*Chieeeeeeek…*

The noise was gradually losing its intensity. Holes were repeatedly
opened and sewn back together on the noise covering the screen and every
time it did so, the cut scene that played before the title screen of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ revealed itself in flashes.

If the culprit of the noise was the unidentifiable monster, then it
would be gradually losing its strength.

I had no time. With my hand which had accumulated years of experience, I
pressed the controller button. Although it was just the same button over
and over again, I could measure the timing. Right about now, it would be
the title screen.

“…Huh?”

Because the noise gradually got weaker, the game console displayed the
title screen as if the screen was cracked.

On the title screen, the \[Continue\] button was activated. As I pressed
it, a single save file appeared. It was a sight that was completely
different from my memories. The language was fragmented so I couldn’t
tell which save file it was, but the save point could be seen clearly.

***Bad Ending N.49 「Demise」.***

It was saved during the progression of a Bad Ending. I could confirm
without a doubt that I had never left such a save file.

*Hwarerereuk───!*

“…!”

The black flames had started to devour the ceiling! Wind and ashes
poured onto my head. There was nowhere to run now.

For a very brief moment, I took a deep breath.

From now on, I had no idea what would happen. However, I had no other
options.

I pressed the controller button hard.

At that moment…

*Chieeeek…*

*Click.*

My field of vision was completely enveloped by noise before every single
one of my senses completely shut down.

◆◆◆

Academy Adventure Cruel Fairy Tale RPG, ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

This game, stringing along various unrelated modifiers together, had
unexpectedly received huge praise when it was first released.

UI and cutscenes in a fairy tale concept. A large-scale open world map
that fully satisfied the feeling of an adventure and a variety of
interactions with the objects within it. Numerous sources of
entertainment.

The production of an academy as the main stage, making it easy to
immerse into the world within the game, was quite incredible.

Also, there was a lot of background music that left quite the impression
on the players to the point that the game was nicknamed ‘BGM Knight’.

It was a foregone conclusion that I would fall deeply for this game.
After all, it was completely my taste.

“…ac…!”

I didn’t even know how many times I had attempted to beat the Evil God
Nephid on hell difficulty. As such, I had seen that Bad Ending many
times before.

Bad Ending N.49 「Demise」.

The activation condition was losing in the Evil God Subjugation Battle,
the closing act of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I recalled the contents to be extremely short.

Ian Fairytale would lose against the Evil God, thus meeting his death,
and the world would become an utter wasteland due to the Evil God’s
magic.

In the following days, the Evil God would become an absolute monarch and
reconstruct the world, creating a world where demons ruled. This entire
story was alluded to with a fairy tale drawing.

In between those two periods of time, I had no idea what had happened.
However, humans were probably unable to survive in the dystopia brought
forth by the Evil God, so the chances of it being extremely terrible
were high.

“…saac…!!”

I felt as if my mind was covered in a fog. A faint voice lingered in my
head. I could not precisely hear what was being said.

Pitch-black vision. I could feel that the state of my body was
abhorrent, to the point that I was reminded of how bad my condition was
right after defeating the Floating Island.

Gradually, my senses returned…

A humid and musty smell that was second only to my semi-basement
one-room eventually permeated my sense of smell.

I could hear the sound of falling water drops. W

***Am I in a cave?***

“Isaac!”

“…!”

The sound calling my name rang like thunder.

My eyes snapped open. Consciousness had returned.

The scenery of a dismal cave. A damp and solid sensation could be felt
behind my back. It seemed like I was leaning against a wall while
staying hidden.

There was no strength in my entire body. I could only feel piercing pain
all over my body as if I was being pricked by needles. The parts of my
body that had turned into stone had long lost their sensation, so at the
very least, I was freed from the pain in those areas.

Anyway, where was this place? I had never once seen a cave like this in
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

“Isaac… What a relief.”

A pretty voice could be heard from the side. With great effort, I turned
my head. Beside me, a female student in a school uniform sat parallel as
she gazed at me.

A tattered uniform that was practically rags, dirty skin, and hair burnt
at the ends. However, her pupils still stone like a blue ocean.

This girl who wore a relieved expression was someone who I never
expected to see at this place.

“Luce…?”

It was Luce Eltania.

Even in this dim cave, the purple brooch attached to her school uniform
vividly stood out. This was undoubtedly the emblem of a 3rd-Year.

What in the world… was going on?

“I thought you had left me, you idiot.”

“Luce, what is this…?”

“Yeah. I wonder what’s going on. You wouldn’t know since you fainted….
Galia sacrificed his life to protect us. Everyone else seems to be
dead.”

Luce was leaning on my shoulder. Her low voice quieted down. It was
faint, filled with tears and weakness.

So, I fainted, Galia threw away his life to protect us, and everyone
else was dead…

As such information sank into my mind, my innermost thoughts surged.

As if aggressively pounding on a door, the supplementary memories that
were buried fought to resurface.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 178

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 3rd

**Title:** Cool-Headed 3rd Year

**Mana:** \[※ Mana Depleted\]

– Mana Recovery Speed (S)

“Ah…”

As I opened the status window, memories that had been concealed behind a
dense fog began to emerge.

I couldn’t remember every little detail of what had happened, but I
could recall everything that had transpired in this world up until a
little while ago.

I had fought against the Evil God Nephid and lost.

And Luce somehow managed to rescue me, but the Evil God’s magic had
descended, bringing forth the end of the world.

According to Luce, it seemed like Galia had sacrificed his life to
protect us.

Outside this cave was a world ruled by demons. The Black Flame Legion
and Apocalypse Dragon-Azhi Dahāka would be roaming around and Angra
Mainyu would be observing the world’s destruction.

I looked at the loading window that was floating in the air. 73% now.

It was only then that I could discern exactly what the loading window in
front of me was.

Initialization meant being transferred to the point in time when I first
possessed Isaac.

In other words, the point in time in my memories when I took possession
was not actually the first time I had possessed.

“…”

I couldn’t say a single word. After all, it felt like I had just been
violently hit on the back of my head.

***I had already faced off against the Evil God.***

<span id="0122_124_Monologue_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 124: Monologue (7)
==========================

**༺ Monologue (7) ༻**

With Dorothy’s interference, the trial was recalibrated and the hidden
truth was revealed.

This was the 2nd Round.

This wasn’t the first time I had experienced this freshman life since
transmigrating into ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I had lost my memories when everything was initialized.

As I reached the threshold of forgotten truths, one after another, the
regret I felt in this world overwhelmed my heart in its totality.

Not all my memories came rushing back, but the significant ones that had
brought me down were returning one by one.

I failed to save Dorothy. She left me a single word of gratitude and
faced her end with the Floating Island.

I remembered myself blankly gazing at the statue of Dorothy, erected in
Märchen Academy. Overwhelmed with helplessness, an unbearable wave of
remorse had washed over me.

I couldn’t protect the Imperial Princess, the Priestess, or Kaya; ***I
couldn’t protect any of them.***

The mere thought of protecting everyone in hell difficulty was utterly
absurd.

‘Hell difficulty?’

Hell difficulty… In a flash, that expression felt intensely out of place
to me. Almost as if Gestaltzerfall had occurred, the consonants and
vowels in my mind scattered separately, giggling.

***In the first place, difficulty levels doesn’t matter when hell is
everywhere.***

I quietly took a deep breath to calm my feelings which were as warped as
a twisted bread stick.

I remembered boasting like a fucking idiot about how I grew strong, just
because I had some meaningless enlightenment. Well, it did have the
effect of making my mental strength more robust, the more I did so.

At the very least, I could keep moving forward.

With that, as I solemnly eliminated my enemies and finally reached the
very end of the scenario.

And in the end, I was defeated by the Evil God Nephid.

And…

‘A system window appeared, saying that the Evil God’s magic bid the
demise of ‘all worlds’.’

Never in my dreams could I have known that it included the world I had
previously lived in, Earth.

A massive secret was hidden behind the scenes of my possession in this
world. I still couldn’t figure out what exactly it was.

However, the overwhelming burden of whether someone as worthless as me
could handle such a secret… weighed on me like a boulder.

“How disappointing…”

At that moment, Luce’s low lamentation echoed into my ears.

“I really wanted to marry Isaac, though.”

“…What?”

***What is she saying out of nowhere?***

My attention became focused on Luce.

“I had that daydream. A daydream where you and I lived… in harmonious
joy with one another.”

Even though I used \[Psychological Insight\], I couldn’t read her mind,
perhaps because I was in the middle of a trial.

However, Third-Year Luce already knew I was the Black Monster. I knew
all too well that she liked me.

“Do you want to hear it?”

Luce gazed at me and smiled sweetly.

She seemed to have accepted my silence as an affirmation, as she began
her story with a small smile and a gentle voice.

“Do you know Asverika? The city of magic and education. Apparently, if
you bring a Märchen Academy diploma there, your life as a wizard is set.
After graduating, we would go to Asverika together and buy a house… I
would be diligently perfecting practical work at the Magic Tower. And
you would work as a wizard in some place like a guild. When we both
finished our daily work and returned home, I would give you a kiss. I
would say ‘You did well today as well, Isaac’ and while I hugged you, I
would whisper into your ear. You’re so weak to my voice, after all,
hehe.”

Luce’s fingers weakly squirmed, as she tapped the back of my hand.

“We would eat delicious meals together, share small talk with each other
in the same bed before falling asleep… And then, I would propose very
simply and modestly on the bed and we would dress up all nicely at the
church and get married… And even after that, we would repeat the same
daily routine. At that time, it might be a bit embarrassing, but we
would also call each other differently. Like… ‘You did well today as
well, dear’.”

With her head bowed, Luce continued.

And I silently yet attentively listened to her story.

“Maybe five children would’ve been nice? Isaac’s body is very robust, so
a healthy baby would have surely been born. The child would have cried
energetically without a moment’s rest. It might be a bit exhausting… but
still, I would have been truly happy because I would have loved those
children so much. There definitely would be tough times. But, we would
get through them, right? We would depend on each other, sometimes openly
share difficulties over a drink, and comfort each other… And in the end,
find things to smile about. That… that’s how we would live. That’s how I
imagined it.”

It was only then did I realize that the reason why I didn’t have to
worry about Bad Ending 「Bird Cage」, even after resolving the Evil God
issue, was because of this.

Luce… wished to build a future with me.

However, I couldn’t say anything right now because I could tell why she
had brought up this story to me.

I felt a terrifying mana outside the cave. The Black Flame horde, the
Evil God’s minions, would soon break into this place.

That was why Luce had brought up such a story as the final thing she
wanted to say.

Realistically speaking, she had likely judged that there was no hope.

“Aren’t you a little sad? You didn’t get to marry me.”

Even in this kind of situation, hearing Luce’s incessant tease made a
laugh trickle out of my mouth.

“That’s what you want, thou-”

*Click.*

Suddenly, from my wrist, a metallic sound was accompanied by the sound
of mana resonating.

Startled, I stopped speaking and looked down on it. A handcuff imbued
with Luce’s mana was fastened on my wrist, firmly affixed to the wall.

***Did she touch my hand in order to put a handcuff on me…?***

My memory was still hazy, so I had not been able to prepare for this.

“You let your guard down.”

“…What is the meaning of this?”

“Don’t worry. You’ll be released after some time passes.”

Only then did Luce sit up from her seat. A strong sense of unease
enveloped my entire body.

“What are you going-”

I swallowed my breath at the fight of Luce’s figure standing before me

I couldn’t see her right arm. Even in this dim cave, I could tell that
blood was dripping down from an empty stump.

Of course. There was no way Luce had easily managed to save me. She
would have lost many things along the way.

Luce knelt on one knee, matching our eye levels. A close distance. A
dark shadow was visible beneath her eyes and her lips were turning pale
blue. Her complexion was extremely pale as if she was someone on the
verge of death.

I held my breath.

With her remaining left arm, she gently caressed my cheek while wearing
a smile as faint as moonlight.

And then, she spoke.

“I love you, Isaac.”

As if she was certain that she would never be able to say such words
again.

As if she had left the last words she so dearly wished to say.

With such a sad voice, Luce quietly whispered.

“I like you. I love you, I really do love you…”

Luce carefully swept back my bangs before kissing my forehead.

As if time had stopped for her, for a long while, she enjoyed the warmth
of my skin with her blood-stained hands and chapped lips.

And then, she pulled away from me, revealing an elegant smile.

“Stay here quietly. I’ll be back soon.”

With those words, Luce began to limp out of the cave.

“Hey, Luce? Luce!”

I tried to rush toward the departing Luce, but the handcuff prevented me
from moving any further.

Even when I pulled on it so hard that it made my wrist bleed, the cuff
refused to snap.

I was in a state of mana depletion, so I couldn’t even cast proper
elemental magic. In the first place, if I used mana, the Black Flame
Legion outside of the cave would perceive it and break inside.

“Stop, hey!!”

Even at my call, Luce didn’t stop. She continued to trudge out of the
cave without any hesitation in her steps.

In no time, she was out of my sight. It was because the cave had a bent
structure.

Luce’s reason for leaving was clear; The dark mana that could be felt
outside the cave. She was aiming to sacrifice herself; she would fight
the minions of the Evil God before they could invade this space.

Luce had put the cuff on me, probably fearing that I would sacrifice
myself in her place.

Lost memories resurfaced.

During the 1st Round.

Right before the initialization finished loading, I had left the cave as
soon as the cuff had automatically released.

And I had witnessed her die in agony as she was devoured by the black
flames.

***The guilt of leaving her to die a painful death, the despair of
hearing the eerie laughter of the black flames surronding her…***

Engulfed by the Black Flame Legion, she had to hear their eerie laughter
alone while I could only stand by and watch; The remorse I felt… The
utter helplessness I felt…

It pierced my heart, as if it was tearing into pieces, and even at my
end, I felt as though I was sinking into an abyss.

“Luce!! I said stop!!”

When the initialization occurred, the transcendental power, in the form
of the so-called ‘Status Window’, would reset everything to the
beginning.

Although I may not know which fucker created this Status Window, I was
certain that the god-like bastard would do it no matter what.

So, I begged her not to leave.

I screamed repeatedly, but Luce did not return.

My mana was already exhausted. Even the Frostscythe within me had
depleted all its strength.

How would I remove this restraint? What did I need to do?

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

A small piece of ice appeared. Even in my mana depletion state, I was
still slowly recovering my mana. At the very least, creating small
chunks with \[Ice Generation\] or \[Rock Generation\] was more than
possible.

It didn’t matter whether the Black Flame Legion percieved my mana or
not. I had to run to Luce immediately. I didn’t want to have any more
regrets.

The fingers of the hand that was fastened to the cuff gradually turned
into stone. With \[Ice Generation\], I made an ice chunk bundled with
high-density mana, before slamming it down onto my now stone thumb.

*Kwajak──!*

“Keughhh…!”

My thumb crumbled into pieces.

My carpal bone had not transformed yet, so pain surged, almost rendering
me unconscious. Even so, I couldn’t take my hand out of the cuff. As
such, I even shattered the metacarpal bone connected to where my thumb
once was.

This much was enough. Immediately, I yanked my hand from the cuff and
jumped up from where I was seated, before sprinting out of the cave.

“Ah!”

However, I couldn’t balance myself like I was used to. I only realized
when I checked my legs. There was only an empty space below my left
knee.

I was not able to feel it because it had turned to stone. It seemed like
I had lost my leg while fighting the Evil God.

I hopped with one leg. Whenever I fell, I got up again and sprang
forward like a spring.

While repeating these actions, I barely reached the exit of the cave.
The exit led upwards.

At some point, one of my arms had turned into stone and while the other
had not been petrified as much, I had obliterated a part of it with the
ice chunk earlier.

My palms were still usable.

I tightly held the irregular surface of the wall with my palm, hung my
arm over to lift myself, and used my teeth to firmly bite the protruding
rocks.

As if I was rock climbing, I did whatever it took to keep ascending and
ascending upwards.

“Keuhak, Haaah…!”

Then, after finally exiting the cave, I laid on the ground, panting for
breath. I spat out my broken teeth. It was fortunate that the exit
wasn’t too high.

As I lifted my head, the scene of devastation filled my vision as ash
scattered underneath a sky enveloped with rock mana.

It was a shockingly vast area; a landscape created when the Evil God’s
magic evaporated the sea. It seemed the place where I had been was
originally an underwater cave deep in the ocean.

Beyond the horizon, a gigantic eye exuding ominous mana contemplated the
world. It was the Evil God’s minion, Angra Mainyu.

Black flames blazed fiercely throughout the land; chunks of high-density
mana that could annihilate anything it touched.

Then, I turned behind me, where a tremendous amount of mana could be
felt. Luce was standing alone, facing the Black Flame Legion.

Now that I could actually see Luce in a brighter place, instead of the
dimly lit cave, it was immediately clear how serious her condition was.
It wouldn’t be strange at all if her already battered body collapsed at
any moment.

Numerous magic circles had unfolded above Luce’s head. It seemed that
she also had nearly no strength left to spare, as the magic circles
flickered unstably.

She was facing off against bizarrely-shaped demons made up of black
flames.

A tremendous number of black flames created infinitely by the Evil God
formed a legion, as they targeted Luce.

High up in the air, a gigantic three-headed dragon let out a grotesque
roar; It was the Apocalypse Dragon-Azhi Dahāka.

*Hwarererereuk────!!!*

Shortly after, the Black Flame Legion spewed black flames. A storm made
of flames raged.

“Luce!!”

\[The demon has been recognized as an enemy.\] \[The unique trait
\[Hunter\] is activated!\] \[Your level and stats are temporarily
greatly enhanced!\] \[Your skill tree temporarily becomes +10!\]

With \[Rock Generation\], I pulled up rocks from the ground to forcibly
push my body forward. Then, I immediately flung my body towards the
storm of black flames.

I had very little available mana left. However, I could unleash at least
one useful attack.

I poured out all the remaining strength into my ruined right hand,
condensing the ice mana within it, and swung my arm to unleash \[Frost
Explosion\].

*Kwaaaaaaaaah─────────!!!!*

The explosion of pale blue ice mana cut through the black flames. The
chunk of ice that was created in a short time was burnt instantly, but
at the very least, it diverted the storm of black flames away from us.

Now, I was entirely drained of my strength. There was nothing more I
could do.

Horrifying pain washed over me, as my body powerlessly fell to the
ground. With a *Crack*, a ghastly sound echoed. Even if I hadn’t fallen
from such a height, the sensation of my ribs fracturing couldn’t have
been avoided.

I didn’t even have the strength to groan in pain. I could barely
breath..

“Isaac!!”

Luce rushed towards me and knelt on both knees, desperately trying to
lift my body.

“I-Isaac…! Isaac! I’m sorry, I’m sorry…! Ah ah…!”

Luce’s voice completely broke. She was wailing. The very same voice that
was always as upright as her aloof persona.

It seemed like she felt guilty because the cuff that she had fastened
ended up ruining my hand, causing me to barely get out of the cave.

There was nothing to be sorry about, though.

As I had no strength left in my body, I had no choice but to rely on
Luce. It was because I had abused my mana.

Luce embraced me tightly. I didn’t even have the energy to lift my head,
burning my face in her slender shoulder. Her nape smelled like blood.

Ash scattered. The Black Flame Legion was slowly closing. The
threatening roar of the Apocalypse Dragon made the ground tremble.

What should I say?

I didn’t want to leave you to your lonesome.

The reason I adored you was because you were more than lovable to
deserve it.

I didn’t want to espouse such shabby things, as if I were in a romance
movie.

***“Luce…”***

I just wanted to respond to her sincerity.

***“…Thank you for loving me.”***

I couldn’t know what was going on in Luce’s mind right now. Her only
reaction was her quivering breath, as if she was barely holding back
tears.

Soon, terrifying and heavy mana pressed against my entire body. It was
because of the dark mana held in the mouth of the Apocalypse Dragon-Azhi
Dahāka. It seemed like it was planning to unleash it upon us.

Luce took a deep breath.

“…Isaac, it’s a bit of a funny thing to say, but…”

A gentle and benign voice, like moonlight.

Luce caressed my head and whispered in a low voice.

“If… I’m reborn… I’ll recognize you no matter what.”

I could feel a weak tremble from her always tender voice.

“I’ll find you again. I promise… I’ll find you again…”

Suddenly, I remembered the first semester of my 1st Year.

When Luce had asked me to be her friend.

Despite her frequent strong aversion to others, Luce never had those
sensations only when it came to me.

From the outside, I didn’t look like anything special. However, solely
because she saw how diligently I trained, she told me it made her want
to keep watching me. Looking back at it now, her explanation didn’t make
sense at all.

…It was a bit too romantic, almost excessively so, to think that a small
part of the emotions Luce was feeling at this moment had somehow carried
on to the 2nd Round. That was why I couldn’t help but let out a burst of
laughter.

It was certainly a funny thing to say.

“See you later.”

Luce left those words.

Somehow, I felt relief in Luce’s arms.

From the very beginning, my goal had never diverted, not even a bit.

My mind became organized.

I had always been that way. As long as a goal was in sight, I would keep
on going no matter what..

From being the Academy’s Weakest, I would become a Demon-Limited Hunter;
To completely eradicate those legions and kill the Evil God.

And to finally welcome a happy ending, putting an end to this shitty
story.

Soon after, the Apocalypse Dragon spewed black flames.

When the pitch-black clumps of flames engulfed us…

\[99%…\] \[100%\] \[Initialization Start.\] \[Moving onto the 2nd
Round.\]

*Chieeeek…*

*Click.*

Within the sense of annihilation, my field of vision was covered in
noise before turning off with a click.

“Haah.”

I exhaled deeply.

The portions of my body that had turned into stone began to gradually
return to their original state.

It all started after my hand touched the hilt of the greatsword that was
at the center of the swirling light brown mana and plunged into the
ground.

By meeting my end together with Luce, I had successfully overcome the
Trial of Sandstone. Because most of my body had turned to stone, I
struggled to ceaselessly crawl all the way here.

But now, I could finally be at ease.

A tremendous amount of rock mana permeated into me. The yellow stone
fragments floating around had simultaneously transformed into their
powder form, before getting absorbed by me.

With my legs that had regained their sensation, I stood up and tightly
gripped the hilt of the great sword with my right hand.

A firm grip. Immediately, I pulled the greatsword out of the ground.

And the yellow-jade rock mana ferociously swirled around, welcoming its
new master.

Gormos’ Obsidian Blade.

The ultimate rock weapon was now in my hands.

\[You have passed the Trial of Sandstone with an iron will and a
tenacious mentality!\] \[Congratulations, you have acquired the trial
reward \[Gormos’ Obsidian Blade\]!\] \[You have acquired the unique
active skill of \[Gormos’ Obsidian Blade\], \[Earth Breaker\]!\] \[You

Chapter 125: Nameless Hero (1)
==============================

**༺ Nameless Hero (1) ༻**

The Emerald Fairy, Sylphia, once said this to mankind.

**Offer me the bones and flesh of the deceased.**

**I shall consume them and bestow eternal life upon this land.**

The Astrea Duchy of the Zelver Empire was a hub of commerce brought
forth by the harmony of lush green trees and wide paved roads.

It was a territory under the command of Duke Gerald Astrea, the Empire’s
Hero and Sword Saint.

And it was also where the blessing of Emerald Fairy-Sylphia was
bequeathed.

However, even such a reputation would naturally be rendered meaningless
in the face of the ever-changing seasons. As proof of this, the forest
encompassing the Astrea Duchy endured the winter, cloaked in white snow.

Kaya Astrea, a noble girl with verdant green twin tails, traversed the
snowy field within that very forest.

Up ahead, thin ice floated by a tranquil lakeside. And at the heart of
it all, an ancient arbor gigantes towered over a tiny island, extending
towards the heavens.

People referred to this tree as the ‘Covenant of Life’; An arbor
gigantes grown to its current state by the seeds sown from the pact
between mankind and the Emerald Fairy.

This tree, unlike others, did not lose its lush green leaves to the
bitter winter cold, as it was shrouded by plant mana. If the Land of the
Fire Blossoms Horan had their Flame of Desire, the Astrea Duchy had this
eternally viridescent tree as their symbol.

As Kaya approached, the plant mana of nature resonated around the
Covenant of Life.

And the light-green mana of nature took on the form of fireflies, as
they began to float around in the air.

“Sylphia!”

Kaya called the name of her precious friend, but her voice scattered
weakly into the forest.

“Sylphia, Kaya is here!”

*Silence.*

During summer and winter break, the Emerald Fairy-Sylphia never revealed
her presence to Kaya.

At this point, even if the other party was a fairy, she couldn’t help
but be concerned.

After wrapping her body in a light green wind, Kaya floated across the
lake and reached the Covenant of Life.

Leaning against the tree, she started channeling her plant mana. Perhaps
the Emerald Fairy would appear after perceiving it.

However, no matter how much time passed, there was no sign of Sylphia
appearing whatsoever.

“Today was fruitless as well…”

Kaya sighed deeply before pushing her back off the tree.

Once again, she wrapped a light green wind around her body and crossed
the lake, before eventually making landfall. And right as she was about
to leave the forest…

“…!”

Suddenly, a sensation sent a shiver down Kaya’s spine; it was an ominous
mana that was now all too familiar to her.

Astrea Duchy. A location quite far from here.

On top of an open ridge, black clouds formed in the blink of an eye and
spread wildly, before swirling around a central point.

Eerie cries echoed in the air. Under the maelstrom of clouds, dark mana
began to ceaselessly overlap on top of each other, as if stacking
bricks.

After this construction was completed at terrifying speeds, an entity,
massive yet elongated enough to touch the sky, scattered dark mana and
revealed itself to the world.

Its pitch-black form was akin to a pillar. Or perhaps, the shape of a
tower.

At first, it seemed like a structure, however, it wouldn’t take one long
to realize the fact that it was a singular entity.

The Devil Pillar. It possessed a physical form and anchored itself to
the surface with its black roots.

Kaya’s eyes momentarily widened, but she quickly regained her composure.
After all, she had already encountered demons many times.

However… No matter how she looked at it, that one appeared extremely
dangerous. Even when compared to the demons Kaya had faced at Märchen
Academy, the power of that black tower would undoubtedly be on the
stronger side.

*Whooooosh───!!*

After imbuing her body with light green wind magic, Kaya began to
traverse the forest at high speeds.

She broke the sound barrier, letting out sonic booms in her wake and
trees shook from the fierce winds.

\[It’s a demon. It looks quite dangerous.\]

Her dark side whispered beside her with a signalment identical to Kaya.
It was another version of her that only she could see.

With her crimson eyes raised chillingly, Dark Kaya glared at the Devil
Pillar. No matter how fast Kaya moved, this personality stuck closely to
her.

\[If you don’t want to die, don’t have any foolish thoughts of running
in alone.\]

“I know. But still, there’s nothing else I can do…!”

Due to Dark Kaya’s influence, Kaya had a good gauge of the demon’s
power.

That black, tower-shaped demon would probably cultivate this area into
its territory.

There would surely be many victims.

It just had to be at this time, when their most dependable combat asset
was gone. Her father, the Sword Saint Gerald Astrea, had traveled far
away with her mother, Historia, to receive the blessing of the Saintess;
It was a ceremony performed at the end of each year.

Furthermore, summoning the Knight Order of the Astrea Household would
take too long.

No matter how quickly the Imperial Court acted, it would take at least
three days. Even if a special force of highly mobile elite members was
formed, it would still require two days, at the very least.

Dark Kaya let out a sigh with her arms crossed.

“Pachi!”

\[Pya!\]

Kaya summoned her familiar Pachi, a flying squirrel with the wind
element, on her shoulder.

“Go to the mansion immediately and deliver this. Go now! As quickly as
possible!”

\[Yessur!\]

Kaya took out a red scroll and handed it to Pachi. It bore the crest of
the Astrea Household, a design resembling the shape of a sword and
tiger.

This was a signal to the Astrea Household. The red scroll indicated the
highest level of danger, essentially conveying to ‘eliminate the threat
with full force’. There was no need to specify what that threat was.

Pachi saluted with perfect discipline, then jumped off Kaya’s shoulder
and spread the wing membrane on its flank widely.

As Pachi flew off, Kaya surged out her mana, as if pouring fuel, and cut
through the air. The streaks of light green mana followed her like a
tail.

\*\*\*

“Tsk.”

“Ian, are you okay?”

“I’m fine…!”

It was an unexpected crisis.

In order to get stronger over the winter break, Ian Fairytale had come
to the Astrea Duchy, accepting one guild commission after the other.

And Amy, a girl who had a black rabbit ear ribbon attached to her short
white hair, followed Ian as if it were a matter of course.

They had been finalizing a commission to hunt demonic creatures with two
adventurers they had met in the Astrea Duchy.

But a demon that looked especially dangerous just had to emerge now of
all times…

With a howl, the black tower shot out dark mana towards the sky. The
large eyes consisting of red pupils were looking down at Ian.

The grotesque-shaped demon had a puffy, squirming exterior.

Huge inky beads hovered numerously, dotting the sky around it; They were
prisons made of dark mana.

Ian hypothesized that the giant demon confined everyone in the area
within those beads to absorb their mana.

Ian, who was swallowed by one of these dark beads, escaped with Amy by
unleashing a sword strike infused with the light element.

The two adopted a combat stance, facing the Devil Pillar. Compared to
the towering demon that touched the heavens, they as humans, appeared
infinitely small.

However, Ian did not falter. Rather, he couldn’t afford to.

High above, countless people were trapped inside the beads of dark mana.
Despite the short time they had been together, he could not just leave
behind the adventurer companions whom he had formed a rapport with, not
to mention the innocent villagers nearby who were swept away by this
chaos.

“I… will not lose…!”

He would save them all, no matter what. Ian strengthened his resolve and
gripped his sword tightly with both hands.

*─────\[Kiriririririririk─────!!!\]*

At that moment, an unpleasant sound reverberated through the atmosphere.

And three dark rings surged up the black tower before rising above it.

*Pshaaaaa───!!*

“Keuk!”

“Kyaaak!”

From the three dark rings, pitch-black mana spread in every direction.

Reflexively, Ian, who was at the forefront, generated an illuminant.

And this light source formed a light elemental shield, protecting both
himself and Amy.

While a storm raged and the ground crumbled, Ian’s shield barely held
off the shock delivered by the surrounding dark mana.

“Kuaaaaaaaah!!”

Ian unleashed a roar of determination. It was a battle of strength, yet,
the outcome was a foregone conclusion.

Attempting to defend against the attack of such an overwhelmingly
formidable demon was ill-judged, to say the least.

It would have been more effective to partially neutralize the Devil
Pillar by cutting it with a light elemental attack like \[Radiant Wing
Slash\].

However, from Ian’s perspective, it couldn’t have been helped. After
all, predicting and annulling the enemy’s attack was extremely
difficult, no matter how talented he was.

*Crack──!*

In the end, the light elemental shield shattered like glass.

And Ian, who had been at the forefront, received the full impact of the
dark storm.

Sequentially, that shockwave flung Ian and Amy off the ground, leaving
them to flounder helplessly in the air.

“Ian!!”

In mid-air, Amy snapped to attention, grabbing Ian’s arm and pulling him
towards her.

Chilly dark mana swept through the air.

In a flash, the top of the ridge had turned to ruin. The earth was
haphazardly splintered and dyed black. Dark mana rose from the ground
like acrid smoke.

Flying flocks of birds, varieties of plants, and animals roaming nearby
all had their life force drained as they drooped feebly.

The Devil Pillar established his own distinct domain. This place had
become a land of death blanketed with dark mana.

*Kuooong.*

Ian and Amy, who were in each other’s embrace, fell back to the ground.
All Amy could do was gaze at the motionless Ian with wide eyes.

“Ian!!”

Ian had fainted.

“This is not the time to faint! Quickly get uppp!!”

After lifting Ian’s upper body, Amy shook his shoulders fiercely while
welling up in tears.

However, no matter how much she shook him, Ian showed no signs of waking
up from his deep slumber.

***This is… a serious problem.***

Without Ian, an existence capable of wielding divine power… How could
she survive against such a demon on her own?

“Huh…?”

Soon, Amy felt all her strength draining out of her body.

It seemed that this area had truly become a land of death.

Amy bit her lips. Since such a massive demon had emerged and this was
the Astrea Duchy, she had hoped for swift reinforcements from the Astrea
Household… but it didn’t seem like she could hold out until they
arrived.

“…You really are high maintenance.”

Even so, Amy couldn’t give up.

Amy took the sword that Ian was holding and stood up.

With her back to the unconscious Ian, Amy faced the black tower and
bravely pointed the sword at the demon extending toward the sky.

The difference in strength was abysmal.

She couldn’t suppress her fear. Her hands holding the sword trembled
uncontrollably. Her survival instincts screamed at her to run away
immediately, but it was too late. Before she could escape this vast land
of death, she would have no choice but to meet her end when her life
force was extinguished. In the first place, there was no way that the
demon would let Ian and Amy go.

She immediately threw away the ridiculous idea of negotiating with that
black tower.

The only choice left was to fight.

Amy’s flames followed along the blade, illuminating her eyes and skin.

At the same time, she unfolded a fire elemental magic circle above her
head.

“Do you even know how much I like you? You dummy.”

And Amy turned her head towards Ian and stuck out her tongue with a
pout, as if she found him insufferable.

*Crackle───!*

She did not have the chance to speak any longer. As the demon unfurled a
grand magic circle from behind, jet-black blades of darkness rained
down.

Swallowing hard, Amy swung her sword clumsily, releasing a sword energy
imbued with the fire element, and shot out a \[Fireball\] from the magic
circle in order to resist it.

However, reality was often harsh.

No matter how much fire mana she poured out, she couldn’t stop a single
one of those dark blades.

Amy sensed death looming over her. So, this was how everything would
end; Without even being able to graduate from the academy. Without even
experiencing love with that idiot. She… she would simply die in vain.

While gazing at the sweeping cascade of dark blades, Amy prepared to
meet her death.

Then.

**「Baphomet’s Hymn (Wind + Blood Element)」**

*Whoooooooosh─────!!!*

A furious wind saturated with mana collided with the dark blades like a
relentless onslaught.

The swirling mana tousled Amy and the unconscious Ian’s hair and
clothes. The clash of parried blades was brutal. No matter how one
looked at it, it was not a sound that wind should produce.

Amy raised her head. A girl wrapped in a light green wind stood still in
the air, as her verdant green twin tails fluttered in the wind.

With highly proficient use of wind magic, she hovered stably.

Amy couldn’t pick her jaw off the floor at the sight of her.

“Kaya Astrea…?”

It was Kaya Astrea, the second daughter of the Astrea Household as well
as the freshman second seat of Märchen Academy’s Magic Department.

Kaya’s pupils were tinged with red. Stopping that demon in her original
state was impossible, so she had no choice but to borrow Dark Kaya’s
strength.

\[Flower of Evil\]. A thorny stem extended from Kaya’s neck up to her
right cheek, weaving together with a pattern of a flower to form a
tattoo.

Blood mana surged within her.

After gesturing towards the Devil Pillar with the Armana Wand, Kaya the
Ravenous assumed a combat stance.

“Hoooh.”

Kaya took a deep breath. Having encountered demons multiple times
before, she could maintain her composure even before the sky-scraping
black tower.

Winning… was not possible. Even Kaya could easily gauge such a
difference in combat power.

As such, the top priority was to endure until the Astrea Household’s
reinforcements arrived. On this land that bore the name of Astrea, Kaya
did not wish for more victims to be made.

“How are you here…?”

“That’s something I should say! Rather than that, let’s talk later…!”

There was no time for conversation. Numerous dark blades sliced through
the air, even cleaving the ground in an effort to reach Kaya.

Kaya rallied her mana and swung the Armana Wand downwards. As she did
so, a magic circle imbued with hues of crimson and light green unfolded
on the ground, sprouting red flesh and enveloping Ian and Amy.

The flesh turned into the shape of a red tree and extended upwards, as
it was covered in tough red bark; An arbor gigantes that could rival the
black tower. It was the best defense that Kaya could currently create.

This was the only way to protect them in the face of this land of death
and that massive demon.

“Well, well, look at this ruckus on Astrea’s land. You demon.”

Dark Kaya snarled savagely.

Once again, dark blades swarmed forth in droves and Kaya resisted with
\[Baphomet’s Hymn\].

The deflected dark blades absorbed the life force of flying birds upon
contact, causing them to meet their demise.

And whenever a single scratch formed on the red tree, it would heal
itself in a matter of moments. As a combination of top elements like
plant and blood, the tree boasted an outstanding level of regenerative
ability.

She couldn’t take a single step back. Dodging these attacks was like
trying to avoid a downpour with just her bare body. Even the smallest
lapse in concentration was forbidden.

“Keuhhh…!”

Kaya’s hand that held the Armana Wand trembled. It was difficult to
endure.

The red tree she had erected was relentlessly cut down. At this rate,
her mana would run out first.

Still, she had to protect them. She couldn’t stand the sight of people
dying right in front of her; even more so if it was by a demon on Astrea
land.

However, the difference in power was all too clear.

As if enjoying itself, the demon repeatedly rained down dark blades with
eyes tinged with laughter.

All Kaya could do was struggle with all her might to hold on.

“Ah…!”

After exchanging dozens of attacks, the power of Kaya’s wind mana
plummeted.

However, the black tower leisurely poured out dark blades aimed at Kaya.

That attack… was impossible to block.

That was when it happened.

A terrifying mana threatened Kaya’s survival instinct.

Even the Devil Pillar seemed bewildered, as the huge eye engraved in its
body opened wide. At the same time, the dark blades turned into wisps of
mana, as the demon absorbed them back into its body.

It withdrew its attack, as if instinctively, it judged that even the
most minuscule amount of strength had to be conserved.

The Devil Pillar turned its attention away from Kaya, witnessing a young
man strolling along the land of death.

When Kaya also looked at the man, her eyes shook in astonishment.

“Sir Isaac…?”

A young man with silver-blue hair, dressed in a navy blue hooded robe.

With just his appearance, the air itself turned heavy, as a dense
pressure descended upon the entire area.

Chapter 126: Nameless Hero (2)
==============================

**༺ Nameless Hero (2) ༻**

After the 1st-Year concluded in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, some enemies
appeared during winter break.

Among them was a rival-like character. I occasionally bickered with them
whenever I visited the guild but I could ignore them for now.

What I actually needed to pay attention to was a colossal demon known as
the Devil Pillar.

The Devil Pillar had been slumbering beneath the lands of the Astrea
Duchy in the form of dark mana since long, long ago; a demon that had
gradually accumulated power little by little over the eons.

If I were to simply let this winter break pass, the Devil Pillar would
descend in its full-blown demon form and bring about a large-scale
catastrophe.

However, if a specific condition were fulfilled, it would be forced to
appear prematurely.

That condition was just one thing; the approach of a being who held
Divine Power like Ian Fairytale.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, if some commission was received, the
player could reach the location where the Devil Pillar appeared.

‘I was nearly too late.’

My \[Clairvoyance\] had become so powerful that I could inspect an
immeasurably vast radius around me. This was all thanks to the steady
increase in proficiency.

Using that power to its limits, I continually observed the Astrea Duchy,
the location where the Devil Pillar would make its appearance. I
couldn’t predict which commissions Ian would take on first and which
ones he would hold onto for later.

As such, as soon as the Trial of Sandstone ended, I told Gormos that I
would see him later, before leaving the trial location and activating
\[Clairvoyance\] once again.

And I ended up witnessing Ian passing through this area…

‘Out of all the times, why was it when…’

***…I was taking the trial?***

In the end, I abandoned the bridge connecting Märchen Academy and the
mainland…

And I secretly summoned Hilde, thus flying high above the clouds. Of
course, I summoned her at a size that was reasonable enough to ride on.
After all, I wasn’t ready to handle Hilde’s original size just yet.

After arriving at the destination and inspecting the surroundings with
\[Clairvoyance\] again, I judged that I didn’t need to worry about
someone discovering my identity. People in this area would all be inside
the beads floating around the Devil Pillar.

When \[Hunter\] activated, I deliberately emitted ice mana imbued with a
chilly aura; it was to attract the demon’s attention since Kaya seemed
to be in danger.

In my current \[Hunter\] state, I was Level 200, the MAX level.

I felt like I was floating. It was a sensation of omnipotence, as if I
could do literally anything.

“Sir Isaac…?”

Kaya was floating in mid-air, wrapped in a light green wind; a single
bead of cold sweat ran down her face. It seemed she was astonished at
the sight of me.

I knew that Kaya would come when the Devil Pillar emerged. This was the
Astrea Duchy. In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it was an inevitability that
she would fly all the way here, no matter when the Devil Pillar made its
appearance.

Fortunately, Kaya had arrived safely without any hiccups and was able to
protect Ian and Amy. She did well holding out.

Originally, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, a makeshift party was formed
to face the Devil Pillar; in it, Kaya was the tank, Amy was the support,
and Ian was the damage dealer. However, considering that Kaya was
holding out on her own, there was no real need to mention the fact that
Ian had fainted.

“…”

When I began to ruminate over the scenario of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱
after undergoing the Trial of Sandstone, everything felt incredibly out
of place.

Was it appropriate to even call it the ‘original scenario’ anymore? My
mind was in utter chaos as I tried to decipher what information could be
trusted and what contents should be discarded.

However, since predicting the future through the lens of the ‘original
scenario’ was still effective, it was best to save my doubts for later.
Well, even if it is different, let’s at least maintain the title of the
game for now.

I stopped in my tracks. The land of death was trying to devour my life
force.

However, its power was ineffective against me. After all, my mana was
much denser than that of the Devil Pillar. It was the same logic as
trying to break a massive piece of steel with a tiny mouse trap; utterly
futile.

“Kaya.”

“Y-yesss…!”

“Thanks. You held out well.”

Although it felt like a line that would come from a shonen, it was
completely sincere.

A shining brilliance of color lingered in Kaya’s pupils. Using
\[Psychological Insight\], I found that she was deeply moved, joyful,
and had an intense feeling of relief, all at the same time.

“Get out of here.”

I calmly flipped the hood of the wizard robe over my head.

Now that I wore the hood, my clothes would activate the function that
disrupted any recognition of me. Even if others saw me, they would not
be able to discern my exact physical appearance.

With a determined look, Kaya nodded before transforming the crimson
arbor gigantes into its mana form.

I felt a gaze piercing the back of my head. By simply activating
\[Clairvoyance\], I could use a mere smidgen of my mana to inspect the
area behind me without turning my head.

As the crimson arbor gigantes turned into shimmering dust and faded
away…

At that moment, Amy, who was holding an unconscious Ian on her knees,
was looking around with an utterly bewildered expression.

“Who…?”

「Ice Generation (Ice Element, ★1)」

*Dudududdudek──!*

A wall of ice rose behind me, blocking the space between me and Amy.

Since she was in a thick tree, it was unlikely that she heard the
contents of the conversation between Kaya and I.

Without even a chance for Amy to properly see me, Kaya lifted Ian and
Amy up in the air with wind magic.

“Ah, w-wait! Kyaaaaah!!”

Soon after, they sliced through the air, immediately displacing
themselves from this location.

Amy, who suddenly found herself floating high in the air, had a
terrified expression as she screamed. Oh yeah. She had acrophobia.

*Anyway…*

Now, only the demon and I remained in the vicinity.

The Devil Pillar glared at me intently. It probably didn’t want to lose
Kaya’s group. However, it seemed way too wary of me to pay attention to
them.

I brought forth the status window of the demon.

\[Babel the Corrupted\] **Lv:** 165

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Fire

**Danger:** Highest

**Psychology:** \[Feeling utterly overwhelmed by you.\]

Babel the Corrupted.

This bastard was the perfect punching bag to test my new strength.

Right now, I was perfectly capable of rational thinking and discernment,
but my mind was also muddled as if I had just woken up in the middle of
the night.

This had occurred after a massive influx of rock mana flowed into me. It
was similar to when I acquired Frostscythe. Perhaps my body was adapting
to the new-found power.

When using my senses, I felt two storage spaces deep inside my body.

In one, a fierce chill swirled, with Frostscythe at its center.

In the other, a stone wall, towering as high as a mountain, stood, with
a heavy greatsword embedded in its center.

I extended my right arm in front of me.

Rock mana gathered and with a light brown glow, a single greatsword was
clenched in my right hand. The rock mana gently coursed through the
blade, illuminating the ancient inscriptions etched into the hilt.

***The Ultimate Weapon of the Rock Element, Gormos’ Obsidian Blade.***

I was greatly pleased by the grip and weight of it. It seemed like it
would be satisfying to swing.

I slung the Obsidian Blade over my shoulder. Light brown rock mana and
topaz-colored stone fragments erupted out of me.

───────\[*Kiriririririk─────*!\]

The Devil Pillar screeched.

From the outskirts of the land of death it had created, black-red mana
slowly rose and extended toward the sky.

The air grew heavy. A colossal wall of flames radiated heat, engulfing
the surrounding area.

Subsequently, after a brief *‘Oooong’*, black-red magic circles were
densely engraved on the wall of flames.

‘It’s using the final pattern of Phase 1 right away.’

Naturally, I expected it to be like this. Had I not already gone through
this when facing Orpheus the Submerged?

The mana seeping out of me was far superior to that bastard. It must
have felt a threat to its survival, so it probably guessed that it would
die if it didn’t pour out its full power from the start.

Every single one of the magic circles were aimed at me…

And with an eerie wailing that went *Kiriririk*, all the magic circles
began to spew out a massive onslaught of dark blades made of black-red
flames.

The bombardment filled the entire area without a single gap as if dying
it in its color.

From the sky, it sliced the air.

From the ground, it cleaved the land.

Countless dark blades simultaneously aimed at me, as if both heaven and
earth surged to reach each other.

*Pa-a-a-at─────!!*

*Kwagagak─────!!!*

The dark blades rushed towards me. The ground was distorted, shattered,
and torn apart, as all the remaining life in the vicinity was drained
away.

A relentless onslaught. I felt it when I was especially singled out. At
the very least, if we were at similar levels, it would have been my
complete defeat.

“…Impressive”

*Whooooosh─────!!!*

As I swung the Obsidian Blade, light brown rock mana surged like a
storm, dispelling the dark blades…

And my rock mana aggressively extended in all directions akin to a
seismic wave.

The giant eye of the Devil Pillar widened in surprise. It seemed
astonished by the fact that none of its attacks could even touch me.

「Eclipse (Rock Element, ★7)」

The passive skill of the Obsidian Blade, \[Eclipse\]. Behind my back,
rock mana formed in the shape of a ring.

It could be applied while the Obsidian Blade was drawn and its effect
was that it covered me with mana armor that had an exceptionally high
defense.

As long as the armor made of my rock mana was not broken, even the
onslaught of dark blades launched by Babel the Corrupted would never be
able to harm me.

My half-opened eyes started to emit a mysterious topaz light.

The high-density rock mana flowing through my entire body gave me a
pleasant sensation of weight.

*Clang─!*

I plunged the Obsidian Blade into the ground. The tip of the sword dug
into the earth, creating cracks.

***Shall I only test the power of this greatsword?***

‘No.’

***No. I can’t stop at just that.***

***There’s a level even beyond my current reach. I can feel it.***

I was in a realm where if I tilted my head even just a little, I could
gaze upon the pinnacle of the ice and rock elements; I could faintly see
the vague silhouette of this new level right in front of my eyes.

My mana circuits rotated at an even faster speed. My once-cloudy mind
gradually regained clarity.

A cold yet heavy sensation.

The extremity of Mana Mastery was trying to awaken something deep within
me.

The rock mana of the Obsidian Blade added a vivid color to that
something.

Through thousands and tens of thousands of repetitions of elemental
magic training without rest…

Through all the blood I had shed until now…

I had piled up experience and accumulated my proficiency…

And now, with the power of \[Hunter\], I drew out the very limits of
this sensation, etched so clearly that it was no different from
breathing to me.

And so…

The two forked paths of two elements, ice, and rock, converged at a
singular point.

*Kugugugugu───.*

A topaz rock armor overlaid the ring of rock mana formed on my back.

With that, several rock rings floated behind me, fixed in place.

Subsequently, a massive amount of rock mana gathered from behind.
Various topaz rock fragments were generated in the air as it floated and
then─.

“Now it’s my turn.”

I cascaded ice mana into the Obsidian Blade clenched in my hand.

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaahooooooosh──!*

A chill billowed out like steam. Rock mana and blizzards raged. My hair
and wizard robe fluttered fiercely.

Ice mana gracefully mixed with the immense rock mana imbued in the
Obsidian Blade.

The ground trembled. In succession, tremendous rock mana erupted behind
me in a brilliantly grand manner.

Within it, a colossal golem, even larger than a mountain range, took
shape before standing upright.

A massive rock ring floated behind the golem’s back.

A pale blue light flashed in the brilliance of its eyes. Ice mana
radiated intensely.

In its hand, a rock greatsword, emulating the power of the Obsidian
Blade, was clenched.

The Synchronization between the colossal golem and me was at its
maximum. It felt like we had become one.

It had stepped into a lofty realm of ice and rock elements alongside me.

Majestic grandeur.

Golem Familiar, Eden – The Breaker.

He overwhelmed the battlefield.

*Kuooooooo━━━━━━━━━━━.*

A familiar’s abilities and growth rate were greatly influenced by its
master.

Perhaps because Synchronization was at its maximum, unlike with Frost
Dragon-Hilde, I could freely bestow my new power, enhanced by
\[Hunter\], to Eden.

As a result, his level had temporarily increased to 175.

And I had succeeded in awakening an unprecedented second element in a
magic beast.

“Eden, get rid of it.”

With my one command, Eden – The Breaker raised the rock greatsword. His
motion alone sent a fierce wind in all directions.

Babel the Corrupted unleashed dark blades like a raging storm, but it
couldn’t even inflict a scratch on Eden – The Breaker, who had the
effects of \[Eclipse\] applied onto him.

*Crash───!*

When Eden took a step forward, the ground shook, generating a thunderous
noise akin to an explosion.

A heavy shockwave roared out. Eden swung the massive rock greatsword
diagonally, drawing a light blue trajectory.

A whirlwind of light blue blizzards and rock debris unfolded.

A blinding flash of light.

Babel the Corrupted was divided, its torso instantly turned into a chunk
of ice, as it started to collapse onto the ground.

However, this was not the end. The next phase still remained.

The large eye engraved onto Babel the Corrupted rolled back, displaying
only its red pupils. And suddenly…

*Kwang─, Kwang─, Kwang─, Kwang─!*

As if rocks were colliding with each other, a rhythmic roar echoed.
Babel’s body folded like a piece of paper and condensed into a single
point.

In an instant, Babel had transformed into a 3m tall ash-gray monster; it
was a muscular one-eyed giant with black flames flickering on its arms
and back. Its lipless mouth, clearly revealing its teeth, was torn all
the way to the bottom of its ears, giving off a grotesque appearance.

Babel the Corrupted, Phase 2.

A magic circle with roaring flames unfolded around it.

In a flash, black flames spread out of the magic circle as if dozens of
whips lashed out uncontrollably, but…

At that moment, I had already reached it after kicking off the ground.

\[…!!\]

I could see the flow of mana. I could see all the attacks in slow
motion.

“Let’s finish this.”

In that split second, I squeezed my way through the gaps of the fire
magic and swung the Obsidian Blade, sounding a whiz in the air.

A light blue flash of light rushed at it.

With a tremendous explosion, Babel’s body split in half.

*Kwagagagang──!*

Vibrations infused with ice and rock mana spread out, creating a
terrifying wind pressure that sent the bisected body of the bastard
flying.

Within the wall of black-red flames, where an intense cold raged and
devoured the heat…

I slung the Obsidian Blade over my shoulder and exhaled a breath infused
with an icy chill.

<span id="0125_127_Monologue_-_Interlude_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 127: Monologue - Interlude (1)
======================================

**༺ Monologue – Interlude (1) ༻**

The air was chilly.

The sky was stretched out wide before Dorothy’s eyes, colored with the
hues of sunset.

However, what actually lingered in her vision was the face of a young
man she held hands with on a bench while gazing at each other.

Isaac.

As promised, he had returned to Märchen Academy. She knew because she
had witnessed him flying on the Frost Dragon earlier. Dorothy breathed a
sigh of relief.

However, Isaac seemed to be in a hurry, as if something had happened.
Unfortunately, Dorothy could not chase after him.

“Kkeung… I can’t even move a muscle…”

Isaac’s hideout inside the Josena Forest. Dorothy was lying on the roof,
whimpering.

The side effects of interfering in a different worldline had rushed onto
her, leaving her unable to even move an inch. If she had spent a little
more time in the sky, she might have helplessly fallen.

She was incredibly fortunate to have hurriedly landed back on the
surface.

\[You overexerted yourself. You shouldn’t have abused that power, you
know?\]

When Ella, the white cat familiar with a pink ribbon on her tail,
scolded her with a coy voice beside her, Dorothy pouted her lips.

“You see here, cat lady. I didn’t have a choice, you know? What else was
I supposed to do when I was worried about the President?”

\[Worry for yourself instead… Worrying about such a powerful guy is just
a waste of time…\]

“No.”

\[Huh?\]

“President is not invulnerable. He isn’t an iron man. He is human and
can break down as well… It was the first time I had seen the President,
who’s always been so boringly upright, look so distressed.”

When Dorothy had encountered Isaac in the other world, his emotions
seemed ashen gray. He was clearly struggling to hold onto his
determination and will.

The only thought that Dorothy had was to save him as quickly as
possible.

She had diligently put on a big smile, laughed numerous times, and
raised her energy levels much more than usual, all because she wished to
save him.

She just hoped he would smile for her.

\[…Are you his mom or something?\]

Ella let out a deep sigh and laid comfortably beside Dorothy. She seemed
to have no intention of responding any further.

“Haaah. President, when are you coming backkkkkk…”

Dorothy tossed her head like a bored child. She wanted to see Isaac as
quickly as possible.

\*\*\*

Before Isaac revealed himself in the Astrea Duchy…

The Knight Order under the command of Astrea was charging towards the
location of the black tower demon, riding horses and familiars.

A size that touched the sky. Swirling black clouds. There was no doubt
that an extremely dangerous demon had emerged.

Kaya had created an enigma of a tree and engaged in a fierce magic
battle against the black tower demon. However, it appeared as if she was
getting pushed back.

Knight Commander, Sharon, had mounted a large eagle familiar and led the
charge at the forefront. It was incredibly urgent. Protecting the Astrea
Duchy by getting rid of the demon was a given, but more importantly,
protecting Lady Kaya was none other than her lifelong duty.

She had long admired Gerald Astrea, the Sword Saint who always
approached battles with eyes as sharp as a hawk. However, his demeanor
changed as his bond with the genius wizard, Historia, was brought to
fruition; Sharon could never forget the way he smiled proudly while
gazing at the newly born Kaya.

Not being able to protect the person she served was far more disgraceful
to a knight than death itself.

She had to protect Lada Kaya at any cost and with whatever means. Sharon
clenched her teeth and inwardly ruminated such a determination over and
over again.

“What is that?”

Suddenly, the crimson arbor gigantes disappeared and the outskirts of
the desolate land of death transformed into a wall of black-red flames.
It was a flame fused with dark mana.

The area it covered extended towards the heavens itself. The heat from
the flames evaporated the clouds in an instant.

And the more the distance to the black tower demon shortened, the more
clearly the knights could feel a powerful mana that stirred primitive
fear beyond the wall of flames.

It was a mana different from demons.

No matter how weak one’s mana perception was, they would have
undoubtedly felt it.

“This mana…?”

Sharon, who had served in the Imperial Knights, had been overwhelmed
before by the immense mana unleashed by an Archwizard.

As such, she knew. Behind that wall of flames, there was something that
equaled or surpassed an Archwizard.

“Commander, this mana…”

“Do you know something about it?”

“Previously, when I was dispatched to Antrico, I have felt something
like this before.”

Sharon’s brows furrowed at her subordinate’s words.

Antrico was a port city located along the Arkins Sea. If a terrifying
mana of such magnitude could be felt there as recently as his latest
dispatch, then…

“The concentration of mana seems even denser now, but it’s unmistakable.
It’s the ‘Nameless Hero’…!”

There was no other incident apart from the fight between the Black
Monster and the Floating Island.

“What?”

One day, an unidentifiable Archwizard appeared at Märchen Academy and
began to punish and eliminate demons.

A powerhouse among powerhouses, who had defeated the gigantic demon
known as the Floating Island.

Saying that a vicious title like ‘Black Monster’ did not suit them at
all, the world had taken to calling them the ‘Nameless Hero’ and revered
them as such.

How did they… know that such demons would appear?

“…!!”

Right then, Sharon saw a girl with verdant green twintails riding a
light-green wind magic to fly, with a boy and girl in tow.

The unstable flight of the verdant green-haired girl indicated that her
mana was nearly depleted.

Sharon’s eyes focused intensely before starting to widen.

“Lady Kaya?!”

Fortunately, Kaya had managed to escape the battle between the
unidentifiable monsters.

Kaya, too, spotted the Knight Order and descended in front of them. With
her was a black-haired man who had fallen unconscious and a white
short-haired girl screaming in panic.

The Knight Order all came to a halt.

As they joined her ranks, Kaya gave the Knight Order the order to stand
by, saying only one thing.

The one who would defeat that demon had arrived.

\* \* \*

“*Sigh*.”

As I felt the hand holding the Obsidian Blade turning into stone, I
immediately stuffed the weapon back into myself; it changed into rock
mana and was absorbed into me.

Once \[Hunter\] deactivated, my nerves eased. When I used
\[Clairvoyance\] and saw Ian wandering around this area, I really
freaked out…

I immediately sat on the ground. Perhaps it was due to the Trial of
Sandstone, but my body was incredibly tired.

Until just a little while ago, I was full of life thanks to \[Hunter\],
as if I had awakened after drinking a load of caffeine when I was
sleepy.

Similarly, the enormous golem familiar, Eden – The Breaker, shined with
rock mana briefly, before quickly shrinking and turning into its usual
small and cute golem form.

He collapsed with his face planted into the ground emitting a groan like
\[Kooong…\]. It seemed that he was greatly exhausted due to the
counteraction of the powerful buffs wearing off.

With \[Hunter\] deactivated, Eden’s level dropped from a temporary level
of 175 to 103. It seemed he leveled up while defeating Babel the
Corrupted.

*Swooshhh──.*

Similarly to my stocks in Korea, the bisected body of Babel turned into
ashes and disappeared.

Subsequently, the wall of flame turned into dust from the top down. I
had deliberately restrained my icy chill so that the barrier could be
maintained and used as cover to hide in.

The dark beads that contained countless people gradually lost their
strength and settled on the ground.

*Boom. Boom. Boom.* As the beads burst, many already unconscious people
collapsed on the ground. In one fell swoop, the dark mana evaporated
from the land of death, which was dyed in black, and the entire area
turned into some large-scale sleeping station.

When the Devil Pillar received damage, it absorbed the life force of the
people caught as hostages and healed its wounded areas. In other words,
the reason why Eden and I went for one-shot kills in both Phase 1 and
Phase 2 was to prevent the opponent from having a chance to steal
others’ life forces.

They would all be weak for a while, but if they ate and rested well,
their strength would return.

\[Babel the Corrupted\] **Psychology:** \[Bewildered because you have
become drastically weaker.\]

Babel let out a *Kiriririk…* as it moaned pathetically.

It must be feeling aggrieved. After all, it had found out that it got
absolutely wasted by some nobody who was far weaker.

‘What to do? You were just unlucky. I’m a Demon-Limited Hunter, after
all.”

The bastard piercingly glared at me with a wide eye before completely
turning into ash and scattering in the wind.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Babel the Corrupted (Lv
165)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 105!\]
\[You have gained 4 stat points!\] \[You have unlocked the achievement
❰I Shattered the Tower Before Even Ascending It?❱! You have gained an
additional 10 stat points!\]

In the place where Babel disappeared, ash-colored clouds rose and formed
two cubes at two points in the air.

Then, the two ash-colored cubes made of mana dropped back onto the
surface.

‘It’s loot.’

I stood up and moved towards them, picking up the two cubes.

\[You have obtained the Loot \[Corrupted Dust\]!\]

Both of these cubes had the same effect; they each granted a unique
skill.

Since each person could only use one, even if one was mine, there was
still one left. It would be better to give it to Ian, who had the light
element.

I shattered one cube with simple ice magic. As I did so, the ash-colored
clump of powder inside the cube seeped into my mana circuit.

\[The energy of the Loot \[Corrupted Dust\] seeps into you…\]
\[Congratulations! You have acquired the Unique Skill \[Domain
Expansion\]!\]

***\[Domain Expansion\].***

Just as Babel the Corrupted turned this area into a land of death, I,
too, could now establish a domain based on my elements. It was the
creation of a territory completely dominated by me.

Since it was a skill, the stronger the caster and the more the skill in
question was trained, the greater the range and effectiveness would be.

Right as I put the remaining cube in my pocket…

‘Ah, I’m exhausted.’

I was so fucking tired. I wanted to quickly go to some accommodation, or
just about anywhere, and rest.

It wasn’t the time to leisurely have a break here. Soon, the Knight
Order under the command of the Astrea Household would arrive.

I glanced at my surroundings with \[Clairvoyance\]. They were still
quite far away.

They must have stopped briefly after joining Kaya. *Nice*.

They would probably come here and carry out search and rescue
operations. Of course, it was probably just going to be a task of moving
people, who had fallen asleep in this large-scale sleeping station, one
at a time.

Anyway, it was best to run away before that.

“Eden, are you okay?”

\[Kuoooo…\]

Eden replied with a tired voice, feebly lifting only his right arm. He
was still slumped on the ground, unable to even raise his head,

It seemed difficult for him to bear the role of a transportation
shuttle, so I just unsummoned him.

“Hilde.”

I summoned Hilde in her small dragon form from the summoning circle
engraved on my left wrist.

\[Did you call, Master?\]

“Use \[Frostwind\], please. Make it weak enough not to harm people. It
just needs to be enough to eliminate the mana trail.”

When using elemental magic, a mana trail was left behind.

What was that, you ask?

When discarding something generated with elemental magic, it usually
turned into dust and disappeared while scattering in the wind.

Unfortunately, when that dust strongly collided with other objects, it
would not be able to disappear immediately, hence a mana trail was left
behind.

It didn’t last long, though. When a moderately strong wind blew, it
would lightly fly away and quickly disappear, just like when releasing
magic normally.

I needed to destroy the evidence before escaping.

\[By your command.\]

*Whooooosh──.*

A silver wind imbued with frost, \[Frostwind\], trickled out from Hilde
and wrapped around the area like a whirlwind. The chill and the strength
of the wind were both weak. Although its color was a bit dark,
reminiscent of fog, it basically just gave off a feeling of a light
winter breeze.

\[Frostwind\] didn’t harm anyone who was unconscious; it simply blew
away the mana trail scattered in the area.

Now, all I needed to do was leisurely disappear like a Dark Hero, and my
painting, would be perfect.

‘…Oh yeah, how much mana do I have left again?’

Come to think of it…

Hilde’s mana efficiency was as much of a scam as she was powerful. This
was probably the reason why I was still far too weak to handle an End
Game level familiar.

Riding such a familiar and flying here would have consumed a lot of
mana. On top of that, she used \[Frostwind\]… Moreover, my body kinda
felt like I was driving a car without oil.

I checked my status window.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

‘Holy fuck?!’

This was bad. My mana was about to run out!

Soon, the Knight Order under Astrea’s command would find me. I couldn’t
maintain \[Frostwind\] for much longer. I had to leave quickly.

“Hilde! Run!!”

\[Ah ah! What is the meaning of this, Master!? Don’t leave me behind!\]

I cut through \[Frostwind\] at full speed.

Chapter 128: Monologue - Interlude (2)
======================================

**༺ Monologue – Interlude (2) ༻**

When highlighting the ballads that wandering bards abundantly sang in
recent times, the subject would unquestionably be about the ‘Nameless
Hero’ who subjugated the Floating Island.

After all, the ‘Black Monster’, who had suddenly appeared at Märchen
Academy while defeating demons, was praised throughout the world with
such an alias.

Moreover, there were reports that the Devil Pillar that appeared in the
Astrea Duchy was also defeated by this same Nameless Hero.

The cold silver wind that had blown during the battle between the Black
Monster and the Floating Island was witnessed even at the location where
the had Devil Pillar emerged.

Despite the many hostages captured by the demon, there were 0 deaths. It
was an unbelievable feat that closely followed the battle with the
Floating Island, which similarly had no casualties.

As such, it was only a matter of course that this news reached the ears
of Gerald Astrea, the Sword Saint, and Historia, the genius wizard.

“Is that so.”

In the middle of the night…

Inside a carriage that was hastily returning to the Astrea Duchy, a
middle-aged man, with verdant green hair swept back, spoke in a low
voice.

His reaction was quite subdued, considering the report he heard from the
escort knight; the one who defeated the black tower demon was confirmed
to be none other than the Nameless Hero.

It was extremely polarizing compared to the chilling wrath he first
showed when notified about the emergence of the Devil Pillar.

Gerald gazed out the window with eyes that could be considered as fiery
as the sun or as sharp as an eagle. A waning moon hung in one corner of
the night sky.

An Archwizard who had vanquished the Floating Island alone without any
sacrifices or losses of life.

Although there was no way to know how such an existence had hid their
identity and popped up out of nowhere…

Regardless, it was an undeniable fact that such a figure had protected
the Astrea Duchy.

“I seem to have incurred a debt to that wizard…”

Gerald wore a meaningful expression.

\* \* \*

Adventurers’ accommodations. The glowing lamp on the desk was the only
source of light, faintly illuminating the darkness of the night.

Amy Holloway, a girl with short white hair wearing pajamas, sat at the
desk with her chin resting on her hand, lost in thought. The black
rabbit ear ribbon she usually wore was nowhere to be found.

On the desk, elemental magic textbooks she had brought to review lay
sprawling open, but Amy could not find it in herself to concentrate on
the contents.

“…”

The black tower demon. And someone unidentifiable wearing a wizard robe.

The robe that the individual was wearing seemed to have a function that
hindered identity recognition. After all, when she caught a glimpse,
their figure was blurry and hard to distinguish.

However, she was the daughter of the Holloway County. Her bloodline
ability \[Heart Color Discernment\] was always activated.

\[Heart Color Discernment\] was a magic that reflected the color of
one’s heart and emotions. Moreover, it was one of the greatest
contributors to the Holloway County’s continued survival in a noble
society full of schemes and deceptions.

From what she heard from the knights under Astrea’s command, the one who
defeated the black tower demon was the Nameless Hero; in other words,
the Black Monster.

And the color of their heart was clearly…

“Blue and… Orange.’

A beautiful blue tinged with orange. It was a color that proved they had
a kind-hearted nature, as well as a sweet hue that only appeared when
one cherished Amy.

Since she only caught a very brief glimpse, it might not be accurate.
Perhaps she even saw it wrong.

After all, not only did they hide themselves with an ice wall and a
chilly aura…

But Amy herself was also incredibly distracted because she was blown
away by Kaya’s wind magic.

However, if the color of their heart was real…

─‘I’m sorry, but I’m trying to kidnap you. Will you cooperate?’

Assuming they were an ice elemental user, there was only one person in
Märchen Academy who displayed those very colors.

A silver-blue-haired boy whose prowess grew explosively after once being
called the Academy’s Weakest.

As Amy recalled his face, her eyes widened in astonishment.

“Isaac…?”

Although she reflexively shook her head at the absurd idea…

Certain questionable moments began to pile up one at a time when
assuming that Isaac was actually the Nameless Hero.

As the night deepened, Amy’s suspicions only continued to accumulate,
layer by layer.

\* \* \*

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 105

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** (2nd)

**Title:** Prospective Second Year

**Mana:** 25500/25500

– Mana Recovery Speed (A-)

Inside the continuously rattling carriage, I gripped the magic tool,
training my Mana Mastery, as I checked the status window. I was
currently on my way back to Märchen Academy.

The demon incident in the Astrea Duchy had been cleanly wrapped up.

After casting \[Frostwind\], I quickly escaped the area swallowed by
Babel the Corrupted and entered a nearby forest.

Fortunately, it was a forest where the snow-covered winter trees still
had some thawed areas. Moreover, a small cave was visible, suitable for
hiding.

Shortly after, I surveyed the surroundings with \[Clairvoyance\]. It
seemed the Knight Order under Astrea’s command was gradually heading
towards the location where Babel had first appeared.

I waited for things to simmer down in the small cave, then cautiously
approached the direction of the carriage station, resting in another
cave in the middle of my escapade.

And early in the morning, I stuffed my robe into my magic pouch and left
the forest to catch a carriage.

If I rode Hilde, it would just be a blatant display that the Black
Monster had arrived at Märchen Academy, so I judged that it was better
to safely return by carriage instead.

As far as I could recall, when it specifically came to carriages bound
for Märchen Academy, gels could be used as currency even on the
mainland. This was because currency exchange was possible at the
academy’s main gate.

It was regrettable that I had to go back without talking with Kaya to my
heart’s content, but it wouldn’t matter too much if it was postponed
until after the break.

The location where the Devil Pillar appeared and the bridge connecting
Märchen Academy to the mainland was relatively close to each other. I
was expected to arrive at the academy early at night.

‘Let’s do a midway evaluation.’

Considering that it was currently difficult for me to properly train, it
would be a good idea to do a midway evaluation to organize my thoughts.

If I checked the definitive things first…

‘First, \[Mana Recovery Speed\].’

\[Mana Recovery Speed\] had increased from B+ to A-. Although I did not
know whether it occurred right after obtaining the Obsidian Blade or
after eliminating Babel the Corrupted, however… that wasn’t important
right now.

I could vividly feel that the speed at which mana recovered was
significantly faster compared to my days as a Grade E.

Back then, it felt like my mana recovered naturally as if water was
trickling down, whereas now, it felt more like a flood.

‘Next, the Obsidian Blade.’

Thanks to Gormos’ Obsidian Blade, I gained several 7-star skills.

Personally, the skill I desired the most was the passive skill,
\[Eclipse\].

Now, even if a powerful enemy capable of doing life-threatening damage
attacked, I could stand tall…

And with my arms crossed, I could drop meteors on their faces while
uttering cool lines like ‘This is order.’.

Moving on, when I dealt that one blow to Babel the Corrupted Phase 2,
\[Stone Breathing – First Form\] didn’t fully activate; perhaps it was
because I didn’t know how to properly swing the sword yet. How should I
put it… It felt like only half of it had activated.

It seemed that if I wielded the sword with only brute force, skills like
\[Stone Breathing\] and \[Heavenly Rock Strike\] could not be used to
their full extent.

It worked perfectly fine in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, but that was
probably because Ian was skilled in swordsmanship.

‘I should at least learn the necessary posture for using these skills.’

At the very least, I needed to practice the correct swordsmanship
movements to be able to use the skills of the Obsidian Blade.

Well, I could probably just find someone who was good at wielding a
greatsword and ask for advice. I didn’t need to delve too deeply into
swordsmanship.

‘I have to give the \[Corrupted Dust\] as well.’

I took out the cube inside my pocket. A solid texture. The cube was
scattering an alien-like ash-gray light.

It would be better to give this cube to Ian. If he unfolded the light
elemental domain, he could affect enemies with Divine Power without even
having to fight.

When looking back at the actions of SSS-Class Master Fainter, Ian
Faintingtale, until now…

There was no way he wouldn’t faint against enemies that emerged during
Year 2 Semester 2, such as Calgart the Necromancer or Thanatos the
Ruination.

If he couldn’t pour out Divine Power against those bastards, a Bad
Ending was practically guaranteed.

‘And Potential.’

\[Potential\] **Stat Points:** 0 ◈ Growth Rate – Physical Training
Efficiency (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

– Magic Training Efficiency (S): 100/100 \[MAX\]

– Learning Efficiency (S): 98/100 \[UP\] Owned Skills ❰❰Details❱❱

Now, if I invested just 2 more stat points, I could max out my Growth
Rate Potential.

Considering that players could only reach MAX Growth Rate by the middle
of Year 2 Semester 1 in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, my current speed was
incredibly fast.

‘Taking down the Floating Island really was huge.’

The Floating Island.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it was an out-of-norm demon that could
never be defeated without Dorothy’s sacrifice.

Thinking about that bastard made the fragmented memories recalled during
the Trial of Sandstone pass through my mind like a rain shower.

The rattling sound of the carriage wheels.

As if time had come to a stop, I could not help but hold my breath for a
while.

1st Round.

The Trial of Sandstone had revealed the memories I had lost, as if
turning on a spotlight within the darkness.

I didn’t remember everything; I could only catch a brief glimpse of
certain memories.

In the 1st Round, I could not prevent the scenario where Dorothy faced
her death alongside the Floating Island.

As such, I despaired and I regretted. But despite that, I steadfastly
continued my journey to vanquish the Evil God…

And in the final moments, I lost pathetically.

In the end, Ian died and the world perished.

“…”

I looked out the window. White snow was fluttering as it fell, coloring
the world in its hue.

Suddenly, I recalled the first time I transmigrated into this world.

At first, I was in denial of my reality, calling the situation a ‘common
cliché’.

However, as I keenly became aware that this world had become my reality,
I set a goal to defeat the Evil God in order to survive.

I knew now; there was something more to the backstory of my possession
of Isaac in this world.

‘It was obvious, though.’

It would actually be strange not to consider that some transcendent
force was involved in such a supernatural phenomenon.

However, it was best to postpone such contemplations. After all, for
now, no clear answer would be deduced by pondering with my troubled
mind.

‘Still, one thing is certain.’

This 2nd Round had distinctly different outcomes compared to the 1st
Round.

I had saved Dorothy…

And had explosively leveled up after defeating the Floating Island.

This irreversible fact ignited the flames of determination within me.

On the gravel road leading to the bridge. Under the somber ash-gray
clouds releasing white snowflakes, the scene of the Arkins Sea, waves
gently swelling, reflected upon my eyes.

As I felt the peaceful atmosphere, quite different from the apocalyptic
landscape in my memories…

I couldn’t help but stare blankly at such scenery for a long while.

\*\*\*

When I arrived at Märchen Academy, the sky was already painted with an
inky black hue.

Before anything, I wanted to talk with Dorothy, who had intervened in
the Trial of Sandstone.

‘Where is Dorothy?’

I wondered, *‘Could she be in the Josena Forest hideout?’*, so I probed
the dark forest path in search of her.

The fire of the hideout’s lamps was ignited. My guess seemed right on
the money.

\[You came.\]

As I opened the door and entered, Dorothy’s white cat familiar, Ella,
greeted me.

Her voice was coy yet haughty per usual.

“Why are you here?”

\[We all have our reasons. But more importantly, over there.\]

Ella gestured towards the bed with her chin.

A goddess with light purple hair was peacefully sleeping in casual
attire, as if this was her own home.

“Doro- Senior Dorothy?”

Since Ella was beside me, I hurriedly added her title as a Senior.

\[She’s been like that for two days. Sleeping, I mean.\]

“Two days?”

Next to the bed, the faint light of the partially-opened lamp flickered
in the darkness.

I sat down on a chair next to the bed Dorothy was sleeping in. Ella, as
if waiting for this moment, began to narrate her story with the tone of
a haughty lady.

Her story went in one ear and out the other; 80% of her story were
complaints, saying how bored and aggrieved she was because she had to be
by Dorothy’s side 24/7 for the past two days.

To put it simply…

Due to the strain of intervening in another worldline, Dorothy had been
sleeping continuously for two days.

And it was the first time Ella had ever seen Dorothy this exhausted.

‘That sounds about right.’

Even though I had only briefly heard about it, it seemed to be an
ability that transcended human comprehension.

It was so impressive that it raised doubts whether this was really
within the realm of mere talent, as she had not even reached the level
of an Archwizard yet.

Either way, just as expected of Dorothy.

Thanks to her, I had resolved the most bothersome issue, so I was only
filled with gratitude for her.

The memory of the monument erected in her honor suddenly flashed through
my mind, making my heart throb in pain, as if it was poked by thorns.

It was a memory of the 1st Round.

However, Dorothy was here before me, alive and well.

She was innocently snoring in a deep and peaceful slumber.

As I ruminated over such a fact, a faint smile suddenly formed on my
lips. She looked so incredibly lovely.

Feeling Ella’s subtle look, I tried desperately to suppress my laughter
by covering my mouth, but my joy was inevitable.

“Is Senior’s condition okay?”

\[As far as I can tell. She might wake up tomorrow, I expect?\]

After jumping on top of the bed, Ella answered while gently shaking
Dorothy’s cheeks with her paws.

Her head swayed without resistance.

\[She is sleeping quite deeply, you know? I tried playing a prank out of
boredom, but she didn’t wake up at all. Basically, this is a perfect
chance to mess with Dorothy to your heart’s content.\]

“Is that so.”

\[And since I’m a cat who does a lot of other things, I often have to
take my eyes off of Dorothy. Whenever that happens, no matter what you
do, I wouldn’t notice.\]

“Ah, okay…”

\[Uhuh, I would absolutely never know. Definitely. Oops, it’s time for
me to go do other things. From now on, no matter what you do to Dorothy,
I will have no idea.\]

“…?”

Suddenly, Ella stepped down from the bed and moved away with a coy
expression.

‘What is she going on and on about? Why is she like this right now?’

I used \[Psychological Insight\].

\[Ella\] **Psychology:** \[Hopes that the love between you and Dorothy
Heartnova bears fruit.\]

“…”

Ella, this girl, was as scandalous as Galia.

***Are all familiars usually like this…?***

<span id="0127_129_Monologue_-_Interlude_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 129: Monologue - Interlude (3)
======================================

**༺ Monologue – Interlude (3) ༻**

Inside the narrow booth, a fascinating video was playing on a box that
she had never seen before.

Various colored lights were twirling and amidst the loud music that
echoed in her ears…

Dorothy and Isaac held a microphone together, dancing to the rhythm as
they sang.

It was the coin karaoke from Isaac’s world.

“Huh?”

And while she was doing that, for some reason, her head moved on its
own.

Once to the left, then once more to the right. Two more times again in
the same pattern.

Shortly after, a familiar voice faintly pierced through the sound of the
music.

\[She is sleeping quite de… She didn’t wake up at all…\]

“…”

Ah, this was a dream.

As soon as she realized that fact, her consciousness was instantly
sucked back into reality.

There was no way for her to know, but the fact that her snoring had
stopped was proof that she had awakened from the dream.

Utter darkness; she could only see pitch-black. A coy voice penetrated
her hazy mind.

It was Ella’s voice.

“Ah, okay…”

‘…!’

And the voice of a man could be heard; it was Isaac.

Dorothy suppressed a gasp. Ella noticed that reaction, but she pretended
not to and continued her conversation with Isaac.

‘President is here.’

Dorothy felt the urge to play a prank as soon as she woke up.

***While Isaac is off guard, let’s abruptly shout to startle him.***
After all, he was easily surprised, so it was fun to tease him.

However…

\[Oops, it’s time for me to do other things. From now on, no matter what
you do to Dorothy, I will have no idea.\]

Even if it was Dorothy, who didn’t like using her brain, she wasn’t a
fool who couldn’t understand the hidden meaning underlining Ella’s
words.

Come to think of it, except for the time on the Floating Island, Isaac
had never approached and made physical contact with Dorothy first.

Of course, she didn’t think someone as upright as Isaac would do
something scandalous while she was asleep, but…

Was it because of Ella’s words? Peculiar fantasies and a subtle sense of
anticipation began to sprout within Dorothy. It was an irresistible
force.

For some reason, Dorothy wanted to keep pretending to be asleep.

Somehow, this atmosphere was….

‘Not bad at all…!’

Honestly, it wouldn’t matter too much if he acted just a little
scandalous…!

Her heart trembled and heat rose to her face. A pleasant chill ran down
her spine.

A rare genius. The greatest powerhouse of Märchen Academy. Dorothy, who
was often labeled as such, was just an ordinary girl who had become
aware of love.

Moreover, this was a secluded place inside the Josena Forest; a hideout
filled with nostalgic memories of just the two of them.

To be honest, she had secretly hoped that they would get intoxicated by
the strange atmosphere here…!

Completely stiff, Dorothy let out a shallow breath. She felt a tingling
sensation all over her body and she became far more aware of Isaac than
usual.

‘Mm?’

***A creak. Did he get up from the chair?***

‘Where are you going?’

Isaac moved somewhere.

The splashing sound of water could be heard. It seemed like he was
washing his hands and face.

Eventually, Isaac returned to Dorothy’s side, sat back in the chair, and
let out a deep breath.

Dorothy couldn’t gauge his emotions because she still had her eyes
closed.

‘He must be staring holes in me.’

It was the first time she felt such a clear tingling sensation due to
someone’s gaze.

***Ah, right. How did she currently appear to him?***

She worried that her hair might be a mess. Were there drool stains on
her mouth? Could it be that her condition was a complete mess?

Her skin quivered. Just as she was thinking about such dilemmas…

‘Oh oh…!’

Isaac started to stroke Dorothy’s hair. Reflexively, Dorothy inwardly
bursted in exclamation.

An extremely gentle touch, as if treating something very precious. Had
she ever so keenly felt the emotions of a puppy who loved being petted
by their owner?

Her body trembled, as nervousness surged like a storm. She was
incredibly embarrassed, her fingers and toes tensed up, but still, the
instinctive desire to be enveloped in his touch held her entire body
still.

It felt so good that it was hard to endure. It felt like her body might
hunch in pleasure.

“I managed to finish well thanks to you.”

“…!”

“Thanks, Dorothy. Truly.”

He addressed her casually. Moreover, in a subdued voice.

Sometimes when Isaac addressed her casually, Dorothy’s head would
flinch.

How was it so enchanting whenever the young man, who used honorifics
every day, spoke informally without permission?

All her nerves were already on edge, but he just had to stroke her hair
and whisper to her in such a sweet voice; it was enough to make her
giddy with ecstasy.

Though Dorothy wished to enjoy this moment a bit more…

‘Urrrghh…! I can’t endure much longer, President…!’

It was excessive how much her body did not feel like her own anymore.

Of course, just because she couldn’t endure it did not mean that Dorothy
knew what to do; after all, she had never had any experiences with boys
in her life.

“Senior, you’re awake, right?”

Right then, Dorothy’s heart dropped.

“…Ah.”

Ah.

A lamentation seeped out of Dorothy’s mouth. She opened her eyes
slightly and made eye contact with Isaac, who was gazing down at her
serenely.

As the strange tension eased, the awaiting sense of shame rushed in like
the wind. Dorothy turned her back to Isaac, covering herself up to her
nose with the blanket.

A heavy silence followed.

Soon after, Dorothy hesitantly raised her torso; her expression seemed
to indicate she didn’t know what to do. Her face was completely dyed in
a bright red.

Although Dorothy could easily control her expressions, as she always
wore a smiling face like a mask…

There was no way she could know how to calm the fiery flush on her face.

“Y-you’re here, President!”

Suddenly, Dorothy smiled excessively and unnaturally raised her tension.

“Senior, aren’t you hungry?”

“Uh, yeah! Uh, I feel absolutely famished…!”

To dispel her embarrassment, Dorothy put her entire soul into responding
with exaggerated reactions.

“I’ll go cook some stew.”

“Ah, thanks…”

Isaac got up and headed to the kitchen.

Dorothy pulled the blanket up and buried her face into the pillow.

In the face of the novel emotions she felt due to Isaac, she was nothing
more than a shy girl.

\* \* \*

I already knew that Dorothy had woken up. It seemed like her purpose was
to surprise me.

It didn’t matter too much. After all, I just wished to express my
gratitude without any pretense.

‘It didn’t seem like I made the right choice, though.’

I didn’t expect Dorothy to show such nauseated reactions of refusal… I
should definitely refrain from such actions in the future.

“Meat stew!! Is there chicken too?!”

Now, she was acting just as usual, as if nothing had happened.

Look at this kid trying to be considerate by pretending not to know. How
heartwarming.

After preparing the meat stew, I served it into two bowls and went up to
the rooftop with Dorothy, courtesy of her starlight magic.

The winter wind was chilly.

And the snow-covered clouds, painted in the colors of night, continued
to gently sprinkle snowflakes.

While deploying an \[Ice Curtain\] to block the cold wind and
snowflakes, I handed Dorothy a bowl of warm stew and a spoon.

We covered ourselves with a thick blanket and used a fire elemental
scroll to make a makeshift campfire. How should I put it… It felt quite
cozy and comfortable.

And just like that, we made small talk, chatting briefly, until…

“We have a lot to talk about, right?”

Dorothy’s question followed.

‘The time has come.’

I had endlessly pondered while spending time in the academy and
exterminating demons.

And the scenario I had envisioned was to only provide information on
subjugating the Evil God to the most trustworthy people at the right
time like I had done with Kaya.

‘I thought that the so-called right time would be after the Alice
subjugation, though.’

Before that, revealing my secrets prematurely seemed like a double-edged
sword.

It would be the same, no matter how trustworthy someone was. It would be
troublesome if something questionable was revealed when I didn’t have
any control over it.

However, Dorothy had even found out that I came from another world. I
found myself in a position where I had to disclose secrets that I had
never intended to reveal.

On the way back, I had finally finished agonizing over what parts of the
truth to reveal.

Now that it had come to this, I decided that Dorothy would be the very
first person to whom I would confess my most important secret.

“Yes, well… I do have a lot to say.”

Let’s not mention the status window or the original scenario of ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱; it would only throw her into confusion.

In this winter, not a single insect chirped. Only the crackling of the
flames created by the fire elemental scroll could be heard.

In this cozy atmosphere, I began to quietly tell my story.

***I came from another world. I don’t know the specific circumstances
regarding how I came to this world.*** ***Honestly, I wasn’t that
strong. However, I had a power that made me stronger against demons.***
***I also knew where and when demons would appear.*** ***And… I also
knew that the Evil God would emerge later.***

Just like that, I told her the most essential contents, keeping it as
simple as possible.

Silence. At some point in time, the once steaming meat stew had cooled
down.

Dorothy had her head lowered slightly, deep in thought. Her psychology
was unreadable due to her starlight mana.

My story probably wouldn’t fully register with her right away. I waited
for Dorothy’s reaction, quietly staring at the now cold stew.

“…So that’s why you trained so hard.”

As expected, Dorothy didn’t doubt my story in the slightest.

In the first place, she could analyze my emotions and detect lies. I
hadn’t lied and we had built a trustworthy relationship over time, so it
was only natural for her to believe me.

But still… her acceptance was way too easy, wasn’t it? It felt like she
knew my goal from the very beginning. The recent remark felt as if she
had prepared the answer in advance, making me feel incredibly out of
place.

“Your reaction is more subdued than I expected.”

“Nihihi, I already knew you were hiding something tremendous. I was
mentally prepared, you see. As expected, the President did have
something, after all.”

***…It somehow sounds like a lie, but there isn’t a way to prove it.***

I had no intention of interrogating Dorothy because of baseless
intuition. Besides, it could just be my imagination, so let’s just move
on quietly.

“I have a lot I want to talk about, but… I’ll get to know it slowly.
Honestly, my head already feels like cramping up from what you said just
now.”

It was understandable. If I was Dorothy, I would probably feel the same
way.

“But it’s like a fairy tale. A story of a Hero defeating the Demon
King.”

“The plot is similar, I guess.”

“Then, the President is the Hero, right?”

Hero.

It was a grandiose title that somehow made me chuckle.

Time passed silently for a while. It felt like both of us were pondering
what to say.

Finally…

“President.”

Dorothy finished her thoughts and extended her fist with a faint smile.
Almost as if she was trying to reassure me.

“I’ll help you. Let’s destroy the Evil God together.”

Suddenly, I recalled the Trial of Frost, when Dorothy told me we should
tear down the world.

Compared to then, her voice was much calmer, but at the same time, it
reassured me greatly.

“…Thank you.”

I extended my clenched fist, meeting hers.

And Dorothy smiled brightly, proclaiming the formation of the Hero’s
Party.

\* \* \*

Bartos Hall, a palace-like building In the center of Märchen Academy.

In the dark Student Council room, only the faint glow of a small lamp on
the desk enveloped the surroundings.

There, a female student with long golden hair repeatedly tapped the desk
with her thin fingers.

A black and white checkered choker around her neck and black and white
earrings on her ears.

Her presence alone made the air in the Student Council room heavy with
tension.

\[Alice. About the Disruptor.\]

In the darkness, a fat purple cat sat comfortably on the reception sofa,
emanating a mysterious blue light from her eyes.

Phantom Cat-Cheshire. The magic beast grinned, openly revealing her
white teeth.

\[As expected, are you thinking that ‘Isaac’ is the right one?\]

After receiving that question, the light gold-haired female student,
Alice Carroll, stopped tapping the desk.

Her cherry blossom eyes looked out the window. White snowflakes were
still pouring down from the night sky.

<span id="0128_130_Alice_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 130: Alice (1)
======================

**༺ Alice (1) ༻**

Heavy snow fell on the quiet campus.

Professor Fernando Frost looked up from his papers and lightly rubbed
his bleary eyes. He looked out the window and saw Märchen Academy
covered in snowflakes.

It would have been a very nice view… If it weren’t for the Floating
Island.

The snow-covered landscape became a trauma of sorts for Fernando,
filling him with a subtle sense of unease. The academy grounds had been
exactly like this just before the gigantic island appeared after all.

What came to mind after the Floating Island was the Black Monster, an
Archwizard now referred to as the Nameless Hero.

It, who appeared suddenly at Märchen Academy and went around wiping out
the demons, was now known to have slain the black tower demon that
appeared in the Astrea Duchy.

This meant that its scope of activity was not limited to Märchen
Academy. It seemed to be able to move around quite freely.

And now, it was winter vacation.

*The words of Aria Lilias, the teacher of Fernando, came to mind.*

─’I assume you have already guessed it, but that monster is probably one
of your students.’

“My… student…”

If the Black Monster was one of his students, who could it be?
Considering that the demons have appeared since the start of this year,
there was a strong possibility that the Black Monster was a freshman,
but even that wasn’t definitive.

Of course, it wasn’t a problem for him to worry about, as even the
Imperial Knights were involved. As the youngest professor, he had a
multitude of work to do during winter vacation.

He needed to revise next year’s class materials based on the active
research results of the Magic Towers.

Just by the preparation for entrance exams, preparation for next
semester’s class evaluation assignments for each grade, research,
writing a thesis, and preparing for threats such as demons…

…He was about to spend his entire winter vacation on all sorts of
miscellaneous work.

Back then, the topic of school closures was discussed in depth at a
faculty meeting. It was due to the frequent appearance of demons. But
now, that topic had faded into the background.

Out of all the things they could have done, the Imperial Family stepped
in and sent the Imperial Knights, saying, ‘We shall ensure the students
their opportunity of receiving education, despite the disaster that may
arise due to demons.’

In other words, the faculty were told to not close the academy.

‘And.’

The Imperial Princess, Saintess, and Priestess.

A situation in which many of the world’s most influential people applied
for the Märchen Academy entrance exam.

Just planning the curriculum and preparing for potential risk factors to
ensure the safety of students was enough to fry the brain.

The presence of the noble students was a great burden to Fernando, who
was preparing for the entrance exam. And something even more peculiar
was that this year’s entrance exam was personally approved by the
Headmistress, Elena Woodline.

Fernando sighed.

“Ugh…!”

*Knock, knock.*

A knock was heard on the office door. When he heard the sound of a
zombie outside the door, Fernando realized that it was a graduate
student.

“Come on in.”

The door opened, and Marco, a male assistant with brown hair, entered
the room. His face bore the appearance of someone not among the living.

Marco approached Fernando, with his creaking body, holding a bundle of
documents.

The gaunt arm placed the pile of documents on the desk.

“Is it done?”

“Ughhhhhhhhhh…”

“Good work. For your next one, you know the rest. It must be done before
the entrance exam.”

“Gueughhhhh…?!”

With nothing more to say, Fernando went straight to the point and handed
Marco a bundle of documents with his telekinesis magic.

Marco screamed, felt dizzy, and stumbled for a moment, but as an
assistant, he had no other choice.

He left the office, trudging along.

Although it was early in the morning, he would stay up all night once
again.

\*\*\*

\[I see you often, child.\]

The cave of the Trial of Sandstone was still filled to the brim with
rock mana.

The spacious cave was mostly occupied by the mountain-like alligator
snapping turtle.

Rock element 8-star magic beast, Stone Turtle – Gormos.

Gormos welcomed me with a voice like that of an old man.

“Hi.”

\[I have come, Gormos!\]

I greeted Gormos along with Hilde, whom I summoned in the form of a
small baby dragon.

Yesterday, I introduced Hilde to Gormos. Unlike Hilde, who showed signs
of excitement, Gormos was calm and gentle, as if he were a wise man who
knew everything.

“Weren’t you bored?”

\[Bored you say? I used to enjoy contemplation, but these days, I have
not had a chance to do so because of all the commotion you two create.\]

Gormos answered, glaring at me with angry eyes.

\[Stone Turtle – Gormos\] **Psychology:** \[Very pleased to see you.\]

***What a tsundere.***

“Don’t worry, I’ll come here often.”

\[I shall come often!\]

\[Huh…?\]

He clicked his tongue as if he were ridiculed, but he didn’t say not to
come back.

“It’s fine if I bother you again today, right?”

\[Hmm… Since it would be unsightly to say no to such a pitiful child, I
have no choice.\]

What the magnificent and gentle tsundere meant by those words was that
he just wanted to play with me.

“Thanks.”

I put Zhonya’s Staff on the ground, did a slight warm-up, then picked it
up again.

I then accelerated the flow of mana within my body, took a deep breath,
and prepared for battle.

*Kududoom, kuung, kuung.*

Rock mana gathered in front of Gormos, and the rock armor crackled and
joined together to form the shape of a golem.

Five golems about 4 meters tall. Behind those was a giant golem nearly 7
meters tall.

They were all rock minions created by Gormos after assessing my level.

\[Guwaaak!\]

As the biggest golem roared at me, a smile formed on my face.

***Yes, this is it.***

I couldn’t have Gormos as my familiar yet. The one 8-star familiar
contract circle I owned was used for the contract with Hilde… Also, I
was currently unable to defeat Gormos.

However, even though the Stone Turtle wasn’t my familiar right now,
there was still a way to use it effectively. This was where those
minions came into play.

They were real opponents with physical bodies. Thanks to this, effective
training became possible, far surpassing what could be achieved with
demonic illusions.

‘If that guy were my familiar, this would have been an unimaginable
sight.’

***In other words, it’s damn good.***

I couldn’t beat that 7-meter boss golem last time, but this time I’d
definitely get it done.

*Thump, thump.*

The golems simultaneously rushed towards me, fiercely swinging their
fists. When I dodged their attacks, they would skillfully cast rock
magic.

Then, I would counter with ice and rock magic.

Hilde watched me from atop Gormos’ shell, but I didn’t have the leisure
to focus on her.

*Booooooom!*

I got hurt, rolled over, became covered in dust, and dodged, all while
pouring magic into destroying the golems.

***This is intense. I can’t take a breath.***

“Sigh.”

However, the more difficult the training became, the more effective it
was, and the more efficient I became at it, the greater the rush of
ecstasy I felt.

Although it was obviously immensely difficult and painful, I was filled
with joy when I thought of how powerful I would become with every golem
destroyed.

*Kua-ka-kang!*

***This is FIRE.***

\*\*\*

Isaac.

When he exchanged greetings, he looked as gentle as a puppy, but his
eyes turned cold-hearted as soon as he entered battle.

Hilde and Gormos watched Isaac as he fought a fierce battle with the
group of golems.

As the battle continued, his sense of combat, elemental firepower, and
mana mastery were improving at a remarkable rate.

\[…Fascinating.\]

Gormos unintentionally expressed his sentiments.

Hilde, the Frost Dragon in the form of a small baby dragon, stuck her
head out and looked down at the head of Gormos.

\[What do you mean, Gormos?\]

\[That child.\]

Gormos blinked its eyes as it quietly watched the fierce battle, with
flashy elemental magic being cast here and there.

Though he was still weak, his talents were clearly those of a genius.

Nor did he spare any efforts.

Plus the aura of the Ice Sovereign…

\[As I live and breathe… What on earth is that kiddo?\]

\[Well, I see him as the reincarnation of the Ice Sovereign.\]

\[…Why do you think so?\]

\[What other explanation could there be? Yes, Gormos, the Ice Sovereign
must have reincarnated to meet me once again!\]

Gormos hesitated on what to say to this foolish White Dragon and then
let out a soft sigh. His large size caused the sigh to create a breeze.

\[Your way of thinking remains romantic, Hilde. I have no idea what to
say.\]

\[There is no need to understand. You just have to feel it in your
heart.\]

*Quaaaaa!*

The conversation between the two magic beasts was overwhelmed by the
explosive sound caused by Isaac’s \[Frost Explosion\].

As Isaac destroyed the biggest golem, he laughed as he fell from the
air, seemingly filled with a sense of accomplishment, as if to say, ‘I
did it.’

Gormos could not take his eyes off that child.

What suddenly came to mind was the image of the Stone Sovereign, who was
full of competitive spirit. The former master who always sought to grow
stronger and preferred to fight against the strong.

\[You just have to feel it in your heart…\]

Gormos quietly pondered what Hilde had said.

\*\*\*

“I feel like I’m dying…”

Evening. The ash-gray sky continued to pour down white snow nonstop.

I crossed the campus covered in snow assisting myself with Zhonya’s
Staff. My whole body was sore…

I almost shouted out of cheer with a sense of accomplishment when I
defeated the 7-meter golem that Gormos had summoned.

But when I was owned by the 10-meter golem that appeared right after, I
had nothing else to do but gnash my teeth in frustration.

I heard there were also compression-type golems; I wonder how strong
those things would be.

\[Master, how about I help you out?\]

“It’s fine… You stand out. I don’t have any mana left anyway, so I can’t
maintain your summoning.”

Hilde was currently in my pocket in the form of a firefly.

This tiny creature was the symbolic White Dragon magic beast recorded in
the mythology of the Whiteclark Duchy. She was way too noticeable to ask
for help. If it were to be seen by anyone in the academy, it would be a
disaster.

In the first place, I didn’t have much mana left after dealing with the
Gormos’ minions.

If I summoned Frost Dragon Hilde or Eden in a large enough size to
support me, my mana would be at risk of depletion. So for now, I would
rather wait until recovery.

Well, it will be fine by the time we get to the dorms.

\[I can now turn into a form that is not noticeable…\]

***What did you say?***

\[Oh!\]

“Gah!”

*Plop!*

Ah, I fell. My legs were shaking and I lost my balance.

Buried in the snow, I raised my head, feeling the chill of the white
snow.

“Argh.”

I was smeared in dirt followed by being covered in snow.

After barely getting up, I brushed the snow off my clothes. Aww, my arms
were shaking.

It was at that moment that I heard the crunching sound of snow being
stepped on from behind. Did someone see me fall? That would be
embarrassing.

“Are you okay?”

I then heard a soft and elegant voice. Somehow… it was a familiar voice.

“Oh, I’m fine. Thank y-.”

As I turned my head to where the voice was heard, my eyes widened and I
turned speechless.

Light gold hair.

A black and white patterned choker around her neck, and black and white
earrings on her ears.

The gorgeous student lowered her torso and looked down at me with her
light pink eyes that had the color of cherry blossoms.

She then put an umbrella over my head.

“Where did you roll around? Your clothes are a mess.”

She elegantly swept her skirt once, squatted down with her knees
together, and gently brushed the snowflakes off my hair.

For a brief moment, I stared at her with a dumb face, not knowing what
to say.

She looked straight into my eyes with a soft smile.

“We’ve met before, right?”

The atmosphere sank heavily. It seemed as if the whole academy was
holding its breath under the endless pouring of heavy snow.

It was Alice Carroll.

<span id="0129_131_Alice_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 131: Alice (2)
======================

**༺ Alice (2) ༻**

***Isaac returned a day after the black tower demon was slain. Didn’t
the timing seem rather convenient?***

This was what Chesire had told Alice; it was information it had acquired
by chance after watching the school gates, lazing around on a tall
building.

Last night, in the Student Council Room.

Alice Carroll quietly pondered as she fiddled with the black and white
choker on her neck.

The Black Monster and the Nameless Hero.

That was what the mysterious being, who defeated any and all demons that
appeared at Märchen Academy, was referred to as by the public.

As for Alice, she knew it as the disruptor; after all, it hindered the
demons from killing Ian, who possessed the light element.

The disruptor was an enemy that needed to be eliminated, however…

By defeating the Floating Island, it had proved to everyone that it had
reached the level of an Archwizard. At least within Märchen Academy, it
was practically the strongest.

Archwizards possessed an abnormally high mana perception, thus being
capable of sensing mana that wasn’t being actively emitted.

So, let’s consider the possibility of Isaac being the disruptor.
Monitoring him using a familiar or minion would be no different than
declaring, ‘Please look at me, I’m suspicious.’. It was simply a foolish
move.

Now, thanks to that stupid Leafa, there was information circulating
about an informant amongst the faculty. This information was also being
shared with the remaining Imperial Knights within the faculty.

Thus, Alice was forced into a situation where she had to carefully
consider how to deal with the disruptor.

“…”

Therefore, what she needed right now was information.

Information about Isaac had already been gathered and, although
suspicious, there was nothing definitive with just that.

As such, what was needed was information that would confirm Isaac as the
disruptor.

If there was certainty that Isaac was the Black Monster, then she needed
to figure out a way to find his weaknesses and eliminate him at all
costs.

Her throat throbbed. Alice gradually rubbed the choker with increasing
intensity.

“Haa.”

Alice calmed her breath and suppressed her emotions before reluctantly
letting go of her choker and looking out the window.

Snowflakes continued to endlessly fall over Märchen Academy.

\* \* \*

The Student Council President. The Shadow of Märchen Academy, as well as
the final boss of Year 2 Semester 1.

Heart Queen – Alice.

The difficulty of 「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」 in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ was extremely high.

Alice, due to deploying an onslaught of Trump Soldiers, was highly
dangerous, even if one was only caught off guard for a fleeting moment.

Paladins, the top tiers and middle bosses of the Trump Army, were
especially difficult to break through.

When such a frightening boss, who manipulated all these forces like a
master puppeteer, suddenly appeared in front of me. I couldn’t help but
be surprised.

‘Why are you here…?’

Big snowflakes continued to fall.

Underneath the narrow umbrella, Alice and I locked eyes. Being in such
close proximity with her had never happened, even in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

Even during vacation, Alice was in her school uniform, probably because
she was on duty as the Student Council President. After all, there was a
conservative tradition of formal attire when visiting the Student
Council Room in Bartos Hall.

Suddenly, the memory of Alice in her school uniform looking down at me
with a smiling face as I died during the Trial of Frost came to mind,
sending shivers down my spine.

However, there was a difference this time — a cape shawl draped over her
shoulders. A Student Council President’s exclusive outerwear made from a
harmony of black, gold, and crimson. It added an extra touch of
sophistication.

***Rather, is it a coincidence that our paths crossed while you were
walking down the street, or did you…***

Putting that aside, was it really a coincidence that our paths crossed?
Or…

‘Did she approach me on purpose?’

As expected, \[Psychological Insight\] didn’t work. Alice’s unique trait
\[Red Queen’s Paradox\] prevented me from even reading the tiniest bit
of information about her.

Well, still…

Even if she was tailing me, there was no way she would know about the
hidden cave where the Stone Turtle dwelled.

During the journey there, I summoned Hilde in the form of a will-o’-wisp
to ensure no one was tailing me. Even if someone had secretly followed
me, the heavy snowfall would have left their footprints in the snow.
There was zero chance of either me or HiIlde not noticing.

Whether one used their own magic or had the aid of a familiar or minion,
they couldn’t have followed me by flying in the sky either. If they did
so, Hilde, with her high mana perception, would have detected them
already.

In other words, even if I was discovered and secretly followed, it must
have been after leaving the Stone Turtle’s cave and strolling through
the academy grounds.

With that thought in mind, I quickly composed myself. I deliberately
opened my mouth slightly and let out a small exclamation of ‘wow’.

If I kept on looking flustered, it might arouse suspicion.

“Why are you so surprised?”

“Ah… Because you’re so beautiful.”

I intentionally stumbled over my words and showed a shy demeanor.

***Nice, this makes me look like a loser.***

Could there be a more excellent lie than this to make up for that brief,
awkward mistake?

***Well, it’s true that she’s beautiful. The lie is that I’m
surprised.***

“I see your taste is sensible. It’s fortunate that you are a normal
person.”

Alice replied calmly, propping her remaining hand on her chin.

She considered her beauty as a matter of common sense. At least in her
eyes, it was a truth on the same pedestal as the rising and setting of
the sun.

“Shall I help you up, baby?”

***Ba… What?***

“Baby…?”

“You’re my junior. Moreover, you look like a baby. Wahhh, I’m a baby\~.”

Alice tugged on my cape shawl that was attached with a red brooch and
shook it near her cheek, displaying coquettish behavior in an unaffected
manner. I couldn’t be bothered to change it to the blue brooch that
symbolized the second year.

‘Why is she so excited?’

I swallowed dryly and looked directly at her.

***…It’s not excitement. It must be a ploy to delve into a person’s
heart.***

If someone didn’t know Alice, they might think that she was a person who
had no trouble dealing with people, but…

‘Not me though.’

As someone who has seen Alice countless times in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, her current behavior felt extremely awkward.

As mentioned previously, Alice was an enigmatic character with limited
information, leading many players to fiercely debate about the topic of
her secrets.

I was well aware of all that content.

I knew every flaw and feature that the light gold-haired villain in
front of me had.

Firstly, Alice’s kind disposition was purely for the sake of her own
image.

In an alley with no people due to winter vacation, it would be much more
in line with her personality to simply ignore a person in trouble and
pass by.

‘If my thoughts are correct…’

It was a situation where the information that there was an informant
within the academy colluding with demons and that Alice’s enemy, the
Black Monster, was an Archwizard was public.

Against an Archwizard, who could even perceive mana that wasn’t being
emitted, choosing the foolish option of secretly monitoring them was
something Alice couldn’t afford to do.

In that case, it would make sense for her to come and find me directly.

She would try to gain certainty of whether I was the Black Monster or
not.

And if she was positive about her certainty, she would plan a scheme to
assassinate me.

And to do so, she would try to find my weakness.

In other words, the possibility that she came to probe me directly was
highly likely.

When I reached such a conclusion, I was now certain.

‘Alice is…’

***…Suspicious of me.***

“Why are you so stiff? It’s like I’m going to eat you up.”

***She’s sharp.***

“I was slightly flustered just now… Did you just act cutesy to me?”

“Why are you bothered by such trivialities? Just think of it as a treat
for your eyes.”

Alice gave her characteristic gentle smile.

“You look slightly uncomfortable. Should I help you get to where you are
going?”

***Let’s get out of here for now.***

I was still considerably weaker than Alice. If things went south and my
identity as the Black Monster was revealed, it would be the end.

“No, I’m fine…”

I tried to stand, but my legs didn’t have any strength and I lost my
balance.

In the end, I stumbled backward and fell on my butt.

It was just snow, so it didn’t hurt… But after falling once, I
completely lost my strength.

“Huh?”

Alice conjured an ash-gray magic circle and used the neutral magic
\[Telekinesis\] on me. An intangible force gently lifted my body.

Usually, living organisms had a strong resistance to \[Telekinesis\]
used by others. It was due to the repelling force between mana, a mana
field if you will.

However, in my current state, it seemed that I couldn’t properly resist
\[Telekinesis\]. Probably due to the fact that I didn’t have much mana
remaining.

***By the way, the density of mana is terrifying. Isn’t this insane?***

“You don’t seem to be in a position to refuse.”

‘Agh, my body…’

My body was in a terrible state.

In this condition, if I were to insist on rejecting Alice’s help because
it was burdensome, it might look suspicious.

“Haha, you’re right…”

***Whatever, let’s just not get flustered.***

I calmed my emotions and thoughts. In order to survive at this academy,
I couldn’t afford to act clumsily.

Well, this might be a good opportunity to find out what Alice thinks of
me.

It would also be good to instill the certainty that I wasn’t the Black
Monster.

‘The situation is in my favor.’

Looking at the state of my body, would it make sense for the indomitable
Black Monster to be staggering like a weakling when nothing really
happened?

So, I just needed to play the part of an ordinary Issac. While doing so,
I’d note Alice’s words, her subtle change of expression, her tone, and
her behavior to find a hint of what she thinks of me.

“It’s a bit shameless to ask, but… May I lean on you?”

I put on a polite smile similar to Alice’s, pretending to be troubled.

I decided to converse with this girl.

“Then, can you straighten your back?”

Alice used \[Telekinesis\] to comfortably fix my upper body in place.

“Well done.”

Alice nodded slightly with a bright smile.

And so, we shared an umbrella and walked side by side in the snow.

I said I wanted to go to the dorms. After all, I planned to shower,
change, and have lunch at the student cafeteria with Luce.

‘This image is quite peculiar…’

Walking under an umbrella like a couple with the final boss of Semester
1 Year 2… Could this be any more ironic?

“Your legs are uncomfortable, right?”

“Yes, I can’t seem to muster any strength.”

“How did you get hurt so badly?”

“I was training by fighting with a summoned familiar… It seems I got a
little carried away.”

“Why aren’t you summoning it now? It’s hard to return, after all.”

“I used up almost all of my mana. And I also wanted to walk in the snow
for a bit.”

“What a cute response, considering your body is a mess.”

Despite the pointless reply, Alice responded with a light laugh.

“Senior is the Student Council President, right?”

“Yes, that’s right. I’m also your direct senior since we’re both in the
Magic Department.”

“Do you usually go out for walks?”

“I usually don’t. I just wanted to walk because it was snowing. Same as
you.”

***This feels like chatting with a pretty senior who is just kind and
not that interesting.***

“But why are you staying at the academy during vacation?”

“Well, it’s just that…”

***I have nowhere else to go.***

…I almost answered like that but stopped myself. Alice’s question felt
cunning for a moment, thus a strong sense of discomfort suddenly
overwhelmed me.

***What made Alice suspect me?***

What if she happened to witness me defeating Babel the Corrupted and
returning?

Alice’s familiar, Chesire, enjoyed roaming around the academy grounds.
So what if that guy had seen me by chance?

‘She might think my answers are a lie.’

I realized once again; a conversation was ultimately about sharing
information. I needed to give appropriate responses without showing any
gaps to Alice.

If she asked such difficult questions, I should naturally continue with
my questions and change the topic.

“I have some family issues that are a bit of a headache. I never really
planned on staying in my hometown for long, even during vacation. I
thought it would be better to train here. Senior is staying here because
you have a lot of work to do, right? You’re the Student Council
President, after all.”

Alice slowly blinked and looked at me directly.

“That’s right. I, on the contrary, would like to go back to my hometown.
Most people would feel the same, though. But aren’t you scared to stay
here during vacation? Considering that there is a monster who could
destroy the world here.”

“Monster… You mean the Nameless Hero?

“Of course.”

Unfortunately, let alone destroying the world, the current me couldn’t
even beat Kaya.

“Since it had protected us from demons, it feels… reassuring rather than
scary. However, since Senior is the Student Council President, it
certainly must be a pain to deal with.”

***Because to you, I’m an obstacle that needs to be dealt with.***

“I see Baby has a deep understanding.”

Alice maintained a calm expression without any change.

“However, I dare to say that the Black Monster is not yet a trustworthy
entity. There’s a lot of uncertainty.”

“Pardon?”

“According to the information observed, it was very savage. So far, its
actions have been protective, but that’s only in hindsight. It might
just be attacking demons due to some unknown circumstances. It wouldn’t
be strange to consider the Black Monster as a… potential risk factor,
since we never know when it could go berserk.”

Alice gently stroked the black and white choker around her neck.

“As the Student Council President, I have to think and prepare
conservatively for uncertainties as long as I’m in this position.
There’s a lot to be concerned about. Such as demons and the Black
Monster…”

“You’re stepping down from your position as President at the end of the
next semester, right? It must be tough, especially at this time.”

“Thank you for your understanding. Speaking of which…”

Alice paused for a moment, as if something came to mind. It seemed like
she was intentionally focusing on her words.

Sometimes, when having a conversation, one might feel suffocated, as
well as experience a fishy and ominous sensation.

It was exactly like that now.

“You have been deeply involved before in a place where a demon
appeared.”

During Semester 1 Year 1 when the demons appeared, many first years were
involved, and it was mostly the same throughout the second semester as
well.

But there was one gap.

‘The hunting evaluation…’

On the day of the hunting evaluation, I faced Kaya the Ravenous from
within the stomach of the underground giant demon.

Externally, I became a victim who almost died from the demon along with
Lisetta, Kaya, and Ian. As such, only a few people were involved.

The Student Council President was also included in the list of members
of the Truth Investigation Committee, so it was only natural that Alice
had heard about me.

“It was the day of the hunting evaluation in the second semester of the
first year. The students’ locations were tracked in real time. Just
before all magic was disabled when the demon appeared…”

Alice’s gaze turned towards me. She was smiling, but a ghastly aura
could be felt from her cherry blossom-colored eyes.

“There were only four people who reached the center of Elt Island.”

Four people.

Me, Kaya, Lisetta, and Ian.

Among them, only Kaya and I had the ice element.

Kaya awakened as a blood wizard and was unconscious after losing to me.

“…”

Meaning, the only suspect left was me.

“Weren’t you… very scared?”

Alice gently licked her bewitching lips.

It was an aggressive question. She overtly revealed her intention to
scrutinize me.

***Gosh darn it…***

‘What a shame…’

She seemed to believe that she had the upper hand in information and
tried to probe me, but unfortunately, she chose the wrong opponent.

“It was indeed terrifying. The Black Monster looked savage, just like
Senior said. But… my memory seems a bit different.”

I looked into Alice’s light pink eyes and pretended to be calm, asking
with a genuinely curious expression.

“Could there be some sort of mistake?”

My voice was low.

“Senior… has no reason to lie to me.”

Chapter 132: Alice (3)
======================

**༺ Alice (3) ༻**

When it came to information warfare, I was bound to gain an advantageous
position.

Alice, as the Student Council President and a member of the Truth
Investigation Committee, must be testing me with her informational
advantage. After all, the information she mentioned earlier was not
something an ordinary student would know.

But…

‘How could I not know?’

I had studied every piece of information related to ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

The method to retain all that information was simple. Ever since I
transmigrated into this world, I had been meticulously revisiting each
and every detail on the parchment I had written the game’s setting on.

And of course, it was natural for me to pay attention at every moment to
ensure that what I knew was not mistaken.

The phrase ‘there were only four people’ that Alice deliberately
mentioned must be bait to corner me. I shouldn’t bite like a fish. If
one excluded Kaya, Lisetta, and Ian, I was the only suspect left for
being the Black Monster.

In other words, if I simply agreed or said ‘I’m not sure’ to that
statement…

It would be like handing over the opportunity to corner me with
assumptions like ‘You were the only one who could be suspected as the
Black Monster at that time,’ or ‘Aren’t you the Black Monster?’

There was a risk of getting played by Alice’s wordplay. Even for someone
who acted well like me, the probability of making an unexpected mistake
increased.

That was why I objected to Alice’s words with a subtly aggressive tone,
saying ‘Senior… had no reason to lie to me.’

This way, I could counter Alice’s indirect interrogation, cut off the
topic in one fell swoop, and in turn, probe her reaction.

Alice’s smile faded, seemingly displeased.

“…Why do you think that?”

“It’s just… Because the number of people I saw and heard about easily
exceeds four.”

Alice made a perplexed expression as if she didn’t understand.

There was a flaw in Alice’s words.

In the hunting evaluation of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, besides Kaya,
Lisseta, and Ian, there were more who reached the core area.

‘Keridna, Ciel, Tristan, Irene, and Doji.’

Among those who reached the core, I only met Lisetta, but the rest also
had the skills to reach the center of Elt Island, before the underground
giant demon appeared, without any issues.

It was just that I didn’t see them.

The Truth Investigation Committee also found out during their
investigation that they reached the core. I discreetly inquired and
found out that they knew about this during the investigation of the
hunting evaluation incident with Lisetta.

The reason I had to pay attention even to such minor details was…

‘Because I must survive.’

In a situation where I must struggle to survive with my poor intellect
and strength against the Evil God capable of destroying the world…

Ensuring that nothing different from what I knew happened, constantly
reviewing and preparing, was one of the best efforts I could make.

Alice’s pink eyes moved to the top right, indicating deep thought.

Soon after…

“…It seems I was mistaken. There have been so many incidents, I must
have confused it with something else.”

Alice took a step back.

Then, we engaged in small talk until we reached the dorm. We headed
towards the men’s wing of Briggs Hall, the dorm I belonged to, which was
for the middle-lower ranks.

“Have you recovered enough to rely on your familiar? I can’t enter the
men’s dorm.”

“I think I’m fine now. Thank you, Senior.”

I smiled broadly, pretending to be moved by the senior’s kindness.

Alice looked at my smile calmly.

“We’re almost there.”

Just as we were about to reach the main entrance of Briggs Hall.

Suddenly, a sinister killing intent enveloped my entire body.

Alice seemed to have felt the same because she slightly lifted her
umbrella to clear her field of vision.

In the corner of the main entrance of Briggs Hall, a female student with
a blue umbrella was glaring this way.

Rose-gold hair. Butterfly hair ornament. A beautiful girl who, even at
first glance, could elicit exclamations of admiration.

However, her expression was emotionless, and not a hint of vitality
could be felt in her oceanic eyes.

“Luce?”

It was Luce Eltania.

\[Luce Eltania\] **Lv:** 158

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Water, Lightning

**Danger:** ??

**Psychology:** \[Strongly jealous of Alice Carroll.\]

***There’s still about 30 minutes left until the appointed time…
right?***

“She must be her. The first year top seat I saw at the social
gathering.”

“Um, yes…”

“Then, I should take my leave here.”

Even if I were Alice, I wouldn’t particularly want to reach the entrance
of the men’s wing of Briggs Hall, filled with Luce’s murderous aura.

“Thank you, Senior.”

“Me too. It was fun, Baby.”

Alice made a sweet, kind smile.

“Let’s meet again.”

She left, still holding her umbrella.

With every step she took, her light gold hair moved like a wave.
Uniquely, the tips of her hair had strands of black and white, which
caught my eye. I remembered that monochrome represented Alice, and this
realization struck me anew.

Soon, Alice’s \[Telekinesis\], which had aided me, faded away. I almost
stumbled, but fortunately, I didn’t fall. I felt some strength
returning.

Anyway.

“Phew.”

***…I thought my heart would burst from trembling. It’s over now. What a
relief.***

“Isaac.”

“…!”

No, it was only just the beginning.

Luce, who had approached me from behind without being noticed, covered
me with her umbrella and whispered in a deep, resonant voice close to my
ear. It was a voice that relaxed my whole body and drained my strength
in an instant.

“Who was that?”

“The Student Council President. She helped me on the…”

I turned my head towards Luce to answer, but her expression made me
flinch for a moment.

“…Way.”

Luce, who often felt aversion towards others due to her social phobia,
was emitting a strong sense of wariness, particularly towards Alice’s
retreating figure. Notice the shadow around her eyes.

The only person Luce has opened her heart to was me. In a way, it could
be seen as a possessive emotion.

Every time my social circle expanded, Luce would be distressed, thinking
that it meant less time for her and me to be together.

Of course, she didn’t express such feelings openly. I would notice it
through her changing expressions and by using \[Psychological Insight\].

“Haa.”

Luce sighed, stood on her tiptoes, and rested her chin on my shoulder. A
faint fragrance emanated from her.

“She helped you? Did you overdo it again, you fool?”

“It’s not something new, is it?”

“You can’t help but work hard, but if you need help, can’t you call me
instead?”

Luce turned her head from my shoulder and looked straight into my eyes.

Her pale cheeks looked soft and chewy, like a mochi pressed down.

Her beautiful rose-gold hair cascaded down as if it would entangle my
clothes.

“I can provide you with a good time.”

She said it as if it were a service.

Her lips pouted. It seemed like she was quite displeased that I sought
someone else’s help instead of hers when she was right there to help me.

“…”

Staring intently at Luce, her image suddenly overlapped with what I saw
during the Trial of Sandstone. This happened time and time again.

Her face was as pale as a corpse. Her lips were blue with fear. The way
she lost her right arm and bled profusely was starkly different from how
she looked now.

“…”

“…Why have you been looking at me with pity lately?”

Of course, she wouldn’t know about my tender feelings.

“I was just looking.”

“I don’t like it.”

Luce once again rested her chin on my shoulder and leaned her head
slightly towards mine.

\* \* \*

The heavy snow that had been falling for two days was gradually slowing
down. Alice walked through the snow with an indifferent expression.

Suddenly, a cold wind caressed her skin, and as gray mana gathered, a
fat purple cat appeared.

Chesire appeared wearing a small bowler hat.

\[How was it?\]

The strange creature waddled after Alice and asked.

\[Does Isaac seem like the disruptor?\]

“…I’m not sure.”

***Is Isaac the disruptor?***

There was no evidence, and the circumstances seemed to indicate that he
was not the disruptor.

Would a person as significant as the Black Monster train so hard and get
hurt like that? He was someone who single-handedly dealt with the
Floating Island. It was incredibly difficult to believe he would be in
such a condition just from training.

Even the weakly casted \[Telekinesis\] had an effect. Despite the mana
field that pushed against mana in living beings.

It was proof that Isaac was extremely low on mana.

What would The Black Monster have to do to be almost completely depleted
of that immense mana? It was simply unimaginable.

So, rationally thinking, the idea that Isaac was the Black Monster just
didn’t make sense.

“Something is odd, though.”

But a person had intuition.

Alice’s intuition seemed to suggest that Isaac was the disruptor. She
didn’t like such uncertain factors.

However, after talking with Isaac, she couldn’t control the feeling that
her intuition was loudly shouting.

Chesire grinned. Being Alice’s familiar, he was able to sense her
feelings.

Therefore, Cheshire realized that Alice’s interest in Isaac had actually
deepened.

\[So, what will you do? Planning to delve deeper into Isaac?\]

“I’ve already prepared a mechanism to pressure the disruptor.”

Someone who possessed the ice element, a first-year student from the
Department of Magic deeply involved in the Elt Island incident, and a
man who returned two days after the black tower demon was defeated.

There were such suspicious circumstances, but in the crucial parts,
there was evidence that Isaac was not the Black Monster. It was rather
these points that were again suspicious.

“I’ll have to see how that boy turns out.”

Therefore, without stopping her investigation into the identity of the
Black Monster, Alice decided to keep an eye on Isaac, who remained a
suspect.

The gray clouds that had been pouring down snowflakes calmed down.

Alice closed her umbrella and shook off the snow.

With every step she took, deep footprints were imprinted on the
snow-covered garden path.

<span id="0131_133_Day_of_the_Entrance_Exam_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 133: Day of the Entrance Exam (1)
=========================================

**༺ Day of the Entrance Exam (1) ༻**

“We’re nearly there, Princess White.”

Märchen Academy was bustling with people for the first time in a long
while, regaining its former vibrancy.

On a sunny morning, with the school gates wide open, young examinees
walked across the grounds, each filled with their own sense of
determination.

It was the day of the entrance exam.

Despite a series of unfortunate incidents, the competition for entry
into Märchen Academy didn’t decrease in the slightest.

Its reputation as the continent’s top academy remained, and the Imperial
Family had declared that they themselves would directly protect Märchen
Academy from the disaster known as demons.

With the widespread information that the fifth Imperial Princess would
be enrolling in Märchen Academy, the examinees felt a sense of relief.

When crossing the bridge that connected the Zelver Empire and the
Märchen Academy grounds, one could enjoy the view of the expansive
Arkins Sea.

Accompanied by numerous guards, a magnificent carriage was crossing the
bridge. It was a luxurious blue carriage with a gold trim, a color
symbolizing the Zelver Empire’s Imperial Family.

Inside that luxurious carriage, a girl with grey eyes was looking out
the window.

Her pure white hair, which reflected the sunlight like snow, was neatly
braided and tied at the back, and adorned with a pretty red ribbon.

She had skin as clean and fair as a doll, and she wore an exquisite
dress that harmoniously mixed white and red.

Imperial Princess Snow White, commonly known as White.

“…”

White did not respond to the knight sitting across from her.

The knight was Merlin Astrea, the daughter of the Sword Saint, Gerald
Astrea, she was a swordsman prodigy selected as White’s personal escort
knight while still being a student at the academy.

‘Almost at Märchen Academy,’ she said… Merlin’s words were undoubtedly
meant to prepare White mentally.

But White just gazed distantly at the horizon beyond the Arkins Sea,
with a wistful expression.

“…Merlin.”

“Yes, Your Highness.”

Blinking once…

…White looked at Merlin, her face filled with fear, before trembling.

“I-I know it’s a bit late, but can’t we just go back now…?”

The tone was cowardly, sharply contrasting with the heavy, contemplative
atmosphere she had been immersed in just moments before.

“It’s not possible. It is an Imperial Order.”

“Look at that vast sea. Many lives must be conceived in its depths.
Wouldn’t there be demons over there? Yes, of course! Oh oh, when you
think about it…! Here, so many demons appear, right? This place is like
a demon realm, a demon realm! Why on earth isn’t this place abandoned
already… No, that’s going too far, but why isn’t it temporarily closed?
No matter how much I think about it, i-isn’t it too dangerous? It would
be better to go back right away, right?!”

“Regardless of the words Your Highness speaks, His Imperial Majesty the
Emperor’s will remains the same.”

***That damned Imperial Order, Imperial Order…!***

Tears welled up in White’s eyes.

***Father, why do you put me through such trials…!***

White was the only princess of age who could attend the academy.

Despite being a princess with high authority in this country, White’s
pure wish was to enjoy her youth as she studied and grew alongside her
peers.

From the beginning, she was completely excluded from the imperial
succession conflict. Being like a flower in a greenhouse, it was perhaps
natural for her to harbor such sorrowful feelings.

Moreover, observing the undercurrents of the upcoming battle for
imperial succession was immensely burdensome.

Inevitably, she increasingly felt the desire to flee from the Imperial
Palace

But, telling Emperor Carlos that she wanted to go to the academy… turned
out to be the root of the problem.

‘Of all places, why Märchen Academy…’

***I want to go to Märchen Academy.***

Not long after saying that, demons started appearing one after another
at Märchen Academy…

And then there was that Black Monster that was said to have reached the
realm of an Archwizard. Where did such a suspicious monster suddenly
appear from? What were the academy’s faculty and the Imperial Knights
doing if they couldn’t identify it?

In her mind, Märchen Academy had transformed into a demon realm where
she could lose her life at any moment.

The protection of the Imperial Knights? That wasn’t enough to reassure
her. She was a fearful person, constantly imagining the worst scenarios
to the point of unintentionally frightening herself.

So when she decided to give up on going to Märchen Academy, this time it
was Emperor Carlos who pushed her forward.

Bianca Anturaze, the Saintess of the Helize Church, and of noble status
in the Holy Kingdom of Bardio.

And Miya, the Priestess of Horan, the Land of the Fire Blossoms.

The reason was that he had learned that these two were planning to
enroll in Märchen Academy.

White had been told that she should definitely build a friendship with
those two when she said she wanted to attend Märchen Academy. It was
said to be for the future of the empire…

The Empress also expressed the same opinion as the Emperor.

In the end, the cornered White was forced to take special lessons to
gain admission into Märchen Academy and reluctantly came to take the
entrance exam as if it were a bitter pill to swallow.

***Why doesn’t she just carelessly take the entrance exam and fail, you
may ask?***

‘I can’t. Absolutely not…!’

The responsibility entrusted to White was extremely heavy.

Where else could one find a social venue like Märchen Academy where one
could be beside the Saintess and the Priestess?

On this small island, becoming peers with those who wield immense global
influence was not just rare, but such an opportunity might never come
again. The chance to be constantly involved with them was truly unique.

Moreover, she was a princess. Having always received high-quality
education from the top wizards of exalted Magic Towers, she was
confident in her skills among her peers.

Naturally, the imperial recommendation letter was delivered directly to
the academy, so bonus points were a given.

Could she, being such a person, fail the exam and not be admitted? What
kind of aftermath would follow… White couldn’t fathom such a terrifying
future.

‘The Saintess and the Priestess will definitely pass the entrance exam.’

After all, they were rumored to be both incredibly strong and
intelligent.

Especially the Priestess, White heard she was a formidable being,
capable of summoning nation-destroying magic beasts as her familiars.
She was so remarkable that in Horan, she was revered as a true ‘Divine
Maiden’.

Thanks to her, Horan was said to be in its golden age…

Each piece of such information turned into a burden like a sandbag,
piling up layer by layer, weighing heavily on White’s shoulders.

“Merlin, I’m scared…”

White trembled with a face full of fear.

Merlin, with her eyes closed and her head slightly tilted in
contemplation, had her dark green hair tied in a ponytail that followed
the movement of her head.

After pondering what to say, she soon nodded her head with a serious
expression.

“Hmm!”

She held her fist tight in front of her chest.

Merlin’s eyes sparkled for a moment.

“The responsibility entrusted to Princess White is immense. The future
of this country… No! The future of the entire world depends on you! Be
strong! You will do well, Princess!”

“Gasp…!”

White felt as though she could cough up blood under the weight of the
pressure.

\*\*\*

The written exam took place in Orphin Hall.

White was on the verge of tears. The results of her intensive training
had shown through.

She wasn’t at the top, but she was confident that she had scored well
enough to safely enter Märchen Academy.

After finishing the practical exam in the dome-shaped Duke Hall, White
walked out with a dazed expression, which was a stark contrast to the
confident stride of her escort, Merlin Astrea.

Regardless, she was the princess. The students stood at attention with
nervous faces, but White had no time to pay attention to any of that.

“Merlin.”

“Yes.”

“I think I might have passed…”

“As expected of Princess White. You are splendid.”

“No, that’s not it… I didn’t wish to be this excellent… All my hard work
wasn’t for thi-!”

*Badumtht!*

Near the stairs leading to the spectator seats, a male examinee screamed
and fell.

The boy groaned in pain. He had rolled down only three steps, so it
seemed he wasn’t badly hurt.

All the examinees’ gazes turned in that direction.

“Ugh… Who is it?!”

The boy was about to yell out of anger but ended up gasping for air.

On the stairs, a girl stood with her leg extended forward, an
indifferent expression on her face. It was clear to everyone that she
had kicked the boy. She was doing it conspicuously.

Beneath a black beret, her black, jade-like hair flowed. Her sideburns
were neatly braided, and her gentle eyes were well complemented by red
cat-eye makeup.

A black robe with the fire and plum blossom emblem of Horan covered her
body down to her knees, but because her leg was raised, her fair legs
proudly displayed the beauty of her figure.

The luxurious black fur on the robe’s collar suggested it was quite an
expensive garment.

“Priestess… Miya…”

Merlin murmured to herself.

“Move. You’re in the way.”

The Priestess with black pearl-like hair lowered the leg she had used to
kick. Her attitude was incredibly nonchalant.

The air in Duke Hall became heavy.

Not only the male student was startled, but the other examinees and
Princess White were equally startled.

Miya, the Priestess from Horan, the Land of the Fire Blossoms. A girl
who demonstrated abilities so overwhelming, they were easily enough to
claim the top seat in this entrance exam, a formidable authoritative
figure, akin to a ruler of the Eastern Nations, and revered as a ‘Divine
Maiden.’

To put it in terms of the Zelver Empire, it was as if both the power of
the Emperor and the authority of the Saintess were concentrated in this
one girl.

If one had even a basic education, not knowing who she was would be
unthinkable.

In the Zelver Empire, her power might be somewhat diminished, but her
status remained unapproachable.

‘But…’

White was puzzled.

It seemed that the male examinee was just blocking the way… Couldn’t the
issue have been resolved with a simple request to move aside? Kicking
him was an overreaction.

The Priestess’s gentle and pretty face didn’t seem to match her
character.

“Shall we go, Lady Miya?”

“Yeah, yeah.”

Following the female escort wizard’s words, the Priestess Miya answered
in an annoyed tone and hastened her steps.

The boy, startled, quickly stood up to apologize, but Miya didn’t even
pretend to listen.

“Oh, Manhalla…”

White, with a look of despair, touched her forehead and called out the
name of god in distress. The scenery made her feel dizzy.

***To have to befriend a woman with such a shitty personality, just
based on first impressions…?***

***What am I going to do about this bleak future?***

White looked at Merlin for help but she just gave a thumbs up with her
sparkling eyes.

Her commanding expression seemed to say, ‘Princess, you can do it.
Become friends! For the peace of this world!’. It brought tears to
White’s eyes.

Meanwhile,

The priestess, Miya, after leaving Duke Hall, walked demurely while
humming a tune.

The Princess, the Saintess, and the Priestess were all globally famous;
they boasted exceptionally neat and beautiful looks among the examinees
and drew frequent glances from others.

Despite the red cat-eye makeup, her calm and innocent-looking eyes
surveyed the surroundings with curiosity.

“Hehe.”

Miya suddenly let out a laugh.

The personal escort following her asked, “Is there something that
pleases you?”

Miya, holding a magic weapon in the shape of a black fan, gently tapped
her lower lip with it and turned her head towards the escort.

“Someone is watching me.”

“What? Who…?”

The escort reached for the wand at her waist, adopting a defensive
stance.

“Mae is telling me now. It’s not an ordinary gaze. This is… a mystical
power. It must be him.”^1^ED Note: Mae definitely refers to
Tamamo-no-Mae aka the name of the Nine tails fox for those who didn’t
know

Miya blushed. ‘Mae’ referred to her nation-destroying familiar, a
nine-tailed fox.

“Hehe, he’s watching over me…! Ah…!”

***Take me, Sir Hero.***

This was the constant plea of Miya, the Priestess from Horan.

‘He’ referred to the Black Monster, the Nameless Hero. A being beyond
imagination who slayed demons and had single-handedly defeated the
Floating Island just a few months ago.

It was clear how much Miya, who usually treated people like trash,
idolized and obsessed over the Nameless Hero. It was quite dramatic.

But to the extent of moaning in excitement… Such a scene was new for the
escort, but it wasn’t too surprising.

But still,

“What gaze?”

No matter how much she looked around, the escort couldn’t understand
Miya’s response.

There was nothing but the scenery of Märchen Academy, mystical or not.

The escort had no way of knowing that Isaac was monitoring Märchen
Academy with his \[Clairvoyance\].

Chapter 134: Day of the Entrance Exam (2)
=========================================

**༺ Day of the Entrance Exam (2) ༻**

“Princess, how about having a meal before you go?”

“Sounds good! Ehehe.”

After leaving the Duke Hall where the practical exam was held, Princess
Snow White let out a forced laugh in response to Merlin Astrea’s
invitation for a meal.

It was all water under the bridge now. White decided to enjoy some
delicious food at the academy’s cafeteria and then return.

***Sure, it’s better to forget this damned reality and enjoy the meal.
Everything will be taken care of by my future self, after all.***

As she passed by the many examinees that gathered around the Duke Hall…

Suddenly, Merlin noticed four examinees. They were all around White’s
age and were at different parts of the campus.

Merlin quickly scanned them.

“…”

In the Astrea family, there was something that Sword Saint Gerald Astrea
emphasized when Merlin joined the Imperial Knights.

‘Cultivate the habit of constantly observing and analyzing your
surroundings. This way, you can prevent half of all crises.’

The reason the four examinees caught Merlin’s attention was because each
of them had specific markings on their bodies.

From Orphin Hall’s written exam to Duke Hall’s practical exam,
constantly accompanying White and closely observing the candidates led
to a realization.

Merlin, with her sharp vision, scrutinized those markings. They were all
trump symbols.

They noticed Merlin’s gaze but deliberately pretended they didn’t.
Merlin, realizing this, turned her eyes forward again.

‘These guys do not seem to care whether Princess White is here or not, ‘

White was the princess of this empire. Every examinee showed special
feelings towards her.

But the four examinees with the trump symbols showed no particular
emotion towards the Princess, the Priestess, or the Saintess.

Whoever they were, Merlin couldn’t help but have an ominous feeling from
them.

“By the way, for a place where demons have appeared numerous times, it’s
quite intact. Honestly, I imagined ruins before coming here. And I
thought there would be big banners hung saying ‘Our Academy is Operating
Fine’ or something like that…”

“Of course not, princess.”

After responding briefly to White’s words, Merlin paid careful attention
to the four with the trump symbols.

\*\*\*

“Lady Miya!!”

The personal escort wizard ran frantically across the campus.

Miya the priestess had disappeared, leaving only a fox fire behind.

It was a spell that created a temporary clone that would dissipate over
time. Miya had already left for another place long ago.

“Sob, Lady Miya!! Where have you gone again!!”

It was time to return to the carriage guarded by Horan’s escorts, but
where had the priestess disappeared to?

The personal escort wizard searched for Priestess Miya while sobbing. If
anything happened to Miya, it would be her head on the line.

\* \* \*

At the corner of the butterfly garden,

I leaned against a zelkova tree and bloomed a \[Frostfire\] in my right
hand.

Today was the entrance exam day for new students, so I wasn’t able to
use the training ground. Thus, I decided to train at the corner of the
butterfly garden, just like before.

However, I needed to check if there were any problems, so I was
observing the academy with \[Clairvoyance\].

‘The main and supporting characters are fine.’

The Pure White Princess, Snow White von Kairos Eifelto.

Insignificant but somewhat sane. The core main character of Year 2 of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. To prevent a bad ending, I must get involved
with this person no matter what.

The Priestess of the Red Lotus, Miya.

I didn’t particularly like her sociopathic, and discriminatory
personality. Note that the absence of a surname was due to religious
reasons, that one shouldn’t attach the meaning of being born to a human
from the ‘Divine Maiden’.

The Agent of the Lord, Bianca Entourage.

***Her, well… I really don’t want to get involved unless it’s absolutely
necessary.***

It seems that the other supporting characters I have welcomed have all
successfully passed the entrance exam without any issues.

As expected, there was one significant deviation that did not betray my
expectations.

“Paladins…”

The mid-bosses of the 「Alice Subjugation」.

The top knights among Alice Carroll’s trump forces; the four Paladins.

They had come to take the Märchen Academy entrance exam.

It was a scene completely different from the scenario in ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱ that I knew.

‘I expected this.’

I didn’t panic. I had already anticipated such variables.

The game scenario I knew was just a factor to consider, like a lottery
prediction number. It was only natural to consider all sorts of
variables.

Alice was in a state where she had to cautiously find and assassinate
the Black Monster. Moreover, being the student council president, she
was well aware of the academic schedule for the next semester.

This meant that she would need an ally who could freely move within the
academy, fulfill academic schedules, and interact with existing
students, and at the same time, could be controlled like a limb and was
also powerful…

Indeed, nothing else came to mind except the Paladins.

‘Don’t they feel guilty lying about their age?’

I wasn’t one to talk, but it was apparent that they had crossed a line
by lying about their appearance and age. The age gap between us was
significant, spanning several decades.

For reference, the Paladins were human. Even if I had poured stats into
\[Vs. Human Combat Power\], I wasn’t too sure if I could achieve the
specs to defeat them by force by the time of 「Alice Subjugation」.

Initially, you had to max out \[Vs. Demon Combat Power\] to get the most
out of \[Hunter\]. Without hitting a stat of 100 in \[Vs. Human Combat
Power\], it would be too much to expect any dramatic effect.

Moreover, I had to prepare for fights against heavenly beings, so I
couldn’t solely focus on \[Anti-Human Combat\].

Once the four Paladins teamed up with Alice, it became risky to monitor
them carelessly because of Cheshire, who could track \[Clairvoyance\].

Using \[Clairvoyance\] to monitor the academy today was the right
choice.

I stopped using \[Clairvoyance\], clenched my fist, and extinguished the
\[Frostfire\].

All that was left was to figure out how to deal with Alice, who had
brought the Paladins with her.

‘I need to think of a countermeasure…’

“Hey, there’s something I’d like to ask.”

“Hmm?”

Suddenly, a gentle voice interrupted my thoughts. I turned my head
towards the sound.

With red cat-eye makeup, a beautiful girl with black jade-colored hair
was looking at me.

It was the priestess, Miya.

\[Miya\] **Lv:** 155

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Considers you a somewhat good-looking insect.\]

‘Why is she here?’

I was surprised for a moment.

Miya’s familiar, the nine-tailed fox, might have sensed my
\[Clairvoyance\], but it didn’t have the ability to track it the way the
Lightning Sovereign or Cheshire did. That was why I was just leisurely
watching earlier…

My eyes naturally drifted to the right index fingernail of Miya, where
the nine-tailed fox would be, then quickly shifted back to her face. It
was better to avoid drawing the fox’s attention as much as possible.

“Where is this place?”

‘Ah, right, she’s bad with directions.’

Her characteristics came to mind. Now I didn’t even wonder why her
personal escort wizard was left behind.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Priestess Miya often slipped away from her
personal escort wizard and wandered around alone. It wouldn’t be a
problem if she was good at finding her way, but she often got lost,
which was a constant headache for her personal escort wizard.

Her psychology wasn’t off either. She considered those weaker than
herself to be insects and didn’t pay them any attention.

This was much more dramatic than Lisetta’s habit of not listening to
weaker individuals. At least Lisetta didn’t consider them pigs.

Anyway,

Since I was using \[Clairvoyance\] until a moment ago, I must have been
emitting mana, and she must have felt it. She would have realized that I
was much weaker than her.

“This is the butterfly garden. Did you get lost?”

I put on a kind smile. I didn’t really want to use honorifics with her,
given that she was a priestess from the Eastern Nation. Everyone has
their pride.

So I decided to pretend I didn’t know who she was.

After all, I could just use the excuse of being an uneducated, poor
commoner who only studied for the entrance exams after leaving my
hometown.

“…You’re a senior, right? Who are you to speak informally to me?”

***This brat…***

As expected, there was no trace of manners.

Fortunately, my expression didn’t falter. I just smiled as if I was
slightly troubled.

“You spoke informally first.”

“Oh ho, that makes sense. I forgot that this is an academy. There must
be customs unique to this place.”

*Sigh.*

“And why am I your senior?”

“I’m going to be admitted here. It’s a done deal, so it’s not a problem,
right?”

***There are many problems with what you’re saying, idiot.***

Still, she was right to be confident about her admission. In ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱, she was the top seat of the first year’s in Year 2.

“More importantly, this isn’t the time to talk with you. I felt the gaze
of my prince…”

“My prince?”

“The Nameless Hero. Surely he was watching over me…!”

“Ah, the Black Monster. How do you know abou-?”

“You pig.”

Priestess Miya looked at me with contempt and there was a rapid change
of attitude. Her gentle eyes narrowed, and her voice which had a hint of
cuteness became authoritative in an instant.

“Who do you think you are calling a monster? Truly a foolish man.”

“…”

It was the authoritative tone she used as a priestess from the Eastern
Nation. She spoke in this tone when she was angry so it became a habit.

“…I apologize for my expression. You seem to really like your ‘prince’.”

“Hmph, I like him indeed. The strength that wiped out the demons and
single-handedly brought down the Floating Island is undeniably
captivating. He’s not someone to be rudely referred to as a monster.”

After I brought down the Floating Island, I heard that followers of the
Nameless Hero sprouted up like bamboo after rain.

Originally, the term ‘Nameless Hero’ was coined to prevent calling the
one who saved humanity the ‘Black Monster,’ so it was obvious what his
followers would prefer to call him.

She, too, must have been a follower of the Nameless Hero. When I used
\[Psychological Insight\], it seemed like I had taken a glimpse of the
heart of a fan who adored a celebrity.

“Ha, enough. I’ve unintentionally bestowed upon you the honor of a long
conversation with me. If I were to meet a senior for the first time, I
would have expected someone like Lady Luce Eltania or the Wizard of the
Emerald Fairy. To think such a man would be my first… My luck is poor.”

“Is that so…”

Kaya was referred to as the Wizard of the Emerald Fairy. She had earned
the nickname from awakening the plant element and continuing the lineage
of Sylphia, the Emerald Fairy.

Luce also eventually earned the nickname ‘Empress of the Abyss,’ but
that’s a story for later.

At the time, Luce and Kaya were quite famous.

As Märchen Academy became the center of attention, the exploits of its
talented individuals, following the Nameless Hero, became the talk of
the world.

Most of the examinees who took the entrance exam that day likely
idolized them.

“I wish I could see the face of my prince instead of this. Hehe.”

Miya, seemingly thrilled just by thinking of the Nameless Hero, closed
her innocent-looking eyes, pressed a folded black fan to her cheek, and
let out a bashful moan.

She still didn’t seem to care about others’ judgment…

‘…She’s doing that on purpose.’

She was probably trying to make it clear that what she was looking for
wasn’t someone as insignificant as me, but rather the strongest of the
strong and the most powerful Nameless Hero.

I realized once again that the phrase ‘a flawlessly beautiful doll’
suited her perfectly, though her personality was terrible.

Then, Miya looked at me and sighed in annoyance.

“Well then.”

She said and walked away.

“Ha, really.”

It was unbelievable.

\* \* \*

\[Miya.\]

“What?”

Beneath a sky that was awash in the vibrant hues of sunset.

After leaving Isaac, priestess Miya walked, deeply pondering about where
the Nameless Hero might be.

A mature and mystical female voice resonated in her head.

\[Didn’t you feel anything when you encountered the boy with silver-blue
hair earlier?\]

“What’s there to feel about an insect?”

\[He looked in my direction at first. After that, I felt as though he
were deliberately avoiding my gaze.\]

Miya’s familiar, the nine-tailed fox, was inside her right index
fingernail in the form of a faint mana entity.

It was a form difficult to detect with an average mana perception.

“How would such a pig with only that level of mana know your location?
Avoiding your gaze on purpose? Must be a coincidence…You’re not
suggesting that he’s my prince, are you?”

Miya glared at her right index fingernail with a fierce look. A tiny
blue flame flickered on her nail, showing a red inner light.

“My prince has a cool demeanor, short hair, over 2 meters tall, and
bulging muscles – a completely masculine macho man. That’s what the
witnesses testified. It’s a different class from that feeble-looking,
soft boy I saw earlier, a totally different class.”

\[Ah…\]

“Ah, my prince. To touch those enormous arm muscles endlessly… or lick
them…”

Her voice, which had been subdued, suddenly became coquettish. Miya
often lost herself in her own world without context.

The nine-tailed fox did not respond.

Having no experience with men due to her life as a Priestess, Miya had
solidified the image of the Nameless Hero through countless fantasies.
No matter what was said, her imagination wouldn’t be broken unless she
personally witnessed the nameless hero.

However, the nine-tailed fox decided to remember the silver-blue-haired
boy.

Because the unease it had felt so far had never been unfounded… not even
once.

Chapter 135: Day of the Entrance Exam - Interlude
=================================================

**༺ Day of the Entrance Exam – Interlude ༻**

“Kaya, is there a boy you like?”

“Puh-huh!!”

A large training ground near the Astrea Mansion.

In response to her mother, Historia’s question, Kaya Astrea, a girl with
dark green twin tails, coughed excessively. She was receiving special
training from Historia.

Kaya quickly turned her head. Her face instantly flushed red. Heat
wafted from above her head, and her jade-colored eyes spun like
whirlpools.

“Uh, Ma’am. W-what do you mean by that…?”

“Aren’t you being oddly formal to me? Anyway, isn’t there a boy you
like?”

“A-a-a-a boy I like?! I-I wonder if there’s such a thing, but naturally,
there would be no boy I like, of course. Choosing who to like is
something to be carefully considered, so if considered carefully, there
might be one, no no, it’s natural to not have one, I don’t have one!”

“I’m starting to get a little scared of you, girl.”

Historia looked at Kaya, who was rambling, with a smile full of
understanding.

Kaya gave up. Indeed, she was someone who could never hide her feelings,
especially in front of Historia.

“It was quite obvious. Now, let’s take a break. Won’t you tell your mom
about your love story?”

“Uh, Mother… Even if you are my mother, I can’t tell you that…”

10 minutes later.

Kaya was completely taken in by Historia’s relaxed way of speaking.

Before long, the two of them were sitting side by side in a corner of
the large training ground.

With her face flushed red, Kaya was hesitating, having already finished
telling the story.

The reason she did not strongly refuse Historia’s coaxing… was because
she secretly wanted to talk about the person she liked. Historia had dug
into that feeling.

“So I see… Many rivals, huh? That’s a serious matter. I never thought a
cute girl like my daughter would struggle with boys. You must claim that
boy soon, or there will be issues.”

“Uh, Mother… The term ‘claim’ is a bit… you know…”

“Oh, you’re still a child, aren’t you? Love is war. It’s about
conquering. Petty pride or consideration only leaves opportunities to
your rivals.”

“It seems like you’re getting a bit too emotional, Mother…”

Perhaps it was because she was reminded of the time she struggled with
women clinging to her husband, Historia became overly emotional.

“Oh, I’m sorry\~. Well, what I’m trying to say is this. If it’s not a
one-on-one love, you need to be selfish and aggressive.”

Kaya thought of Isaac.

Then she thought of rivals like Luce and Dorothy.

Her fist trembled with a competitive spirit. Could she overcome those
powerful competitors and win over Isaac…?

“Yoo-hoo! I’m excited\~. What kind of man will our daughter bring!”

Historia embraced Kaya’s shoulder from beside her.

Kaya, surprised, unclenched her fist.

“Mom is confident that she will objectively evaluate whoever Kaya
brings! Whether that guy is a good person or not! Which noble’s son is
he? Or a tycoon? Ah, I’m so excited! It feels like there’s one more
piece of entertainment!”

Historia was very cheerful, of course, because she had no idea who the
person in question was.

Kaya liked Isaac, but the thought of actually having a formal meeting
made her feel dizzy.

The youngest archwizard in history.

The Nameless Hero who single-handedly defeated a powerful demon that had
tormented humanity for a thousand years: The Floating Island.

Kaya wondered… if Historia could really evaluate that very Isaac
impartially.

Upon such reflection, she realized once again how incredible the boy she
had fallen for was. Kaya felt herself shrinking.

“…Hehe.”

***Still.***

“Someday, I’ll bring him. Definitely.”

Indeed, she couldn’t give up on Isaac.

Therefore, she resolved not to lose to Luce and Dorothy. Kaya reaffirmed
her own determination.

\*\*\*

At the time when dusk settled.

The escort wizard from Horan, crying and running, searched for the
Priestess Miya. Fortunately, she succeeded in finding her in the
Butterfly Garden.

Miya grumbled about needing to find her prince, but the escort wizard
earnestly persuaded her that, according to academy rules, examinees must
leave before sunset.

This was the academy where the Nameless Hero resided in seclusion. Miya,
though regretful, decided to abide by the rules of this place.

Thus, Miya obediently followed the escort wizard back to where the
carriage of Horan was located.

Only then could the escort wizard hold back her tears.

Meanwhile,

“Life is truly futile.”

The imperial carriage of the Zelver Empire was leaving Märchen Academy
and crossing the bridge that connected the mainland.

Examinees had to leave Märchen Academy before sunset, and if there were
problems going home, they had to secure external accommodations. Even
the members of the Imperial Family were not exempt.

Imperial Princess Snow White, looked out the carriage window at the
Arkins Sea scenery.

To her distant voice, Merlin Astrea responded with a perfunctory, “Is
that so?”

“…”

When Princess White hinted for her to ask for the reason why, Merlin
said, “Ah,” in response.

“Why do you hold such an opinion…?”

“Because the position of a princess means nothing in the face of
humanity’s fundamental fears and uncertain future.”

“Yes, I see…”

Merlin nodded as if impressed.

From Merlin’s perspective, White seemed quite subdued, as if her whole
body was expressing, ‘I am in a disheartened state.’

‘Indeed, she seems quite disheartened.’

Merlin stroked her chin in thought. As she moved, her partial armor made
a metallic sound.

The skills of the Saintess and the Priestess were exceptionally
excellent. She knew this thanks to the chatter of passing examinees, and
White’s own ramblings.

According to the Emperor’s order, she was to build a good relationship
with the Saintess and the Priestess. That way, she could contribute to
the peace of the Zelver Empire and the world…

White, being innocent and less skilled than them, was certainly a cause
for concern.

“Princess White will do well.”

So Merlin decided to comfort White.

“Ha ha… Really, do you think so…?”

“There is no doubt about it. Well, wouldn’t the Priestess and the
Saintess be impressed by Princess White’s good character?”

“B-but, they didn’t seem like such people at all?! What on earth did you
see, Merlin?”

The Saintess and the Priestess that White saw today were far different
from her imagination.

***A noble Saintess? She’s tougher than anyone.***

***An elegant Priestess? Her personality is terribly shitty.***

Both seemed like people who lived in their own way without considering
others. It was questionable whether they had developed any social
skills.

If not for an external stance, White would have resolved to never get
involved with them.

“I meant not to worry too much. You have just taken the entrance exam,
after all.”

“Ahaha…”

White let out a forced laugh, then took out a small pocket watch, about
the size of two fingers, from beneath her garment to look at.

“Princess, what would that be?”

It was a pocket watch, but its face had no numbers, and its hands did
not move.

However, its appearance, as if it captured the night sky with the Milky
Way flowing through it, was incredibly beautiful. The case was platinum,
it was clear to anyone who looked at it that it was incredibly
expensive.

“It’s a broken watch. It’s nice to look at it when my mind is cluttered.
Maybe it’s a feeling that clears my mind? It makes random thoughts fly
away.”

The pocket watch held by White was no less than a piece of art. After
losing its original purpose of telling time, the only thing the watch
had going for it was its exceptional beauty.

However, White gazed at this watch, trying to gulp down the anxiety and
the burden that the uncertain future brought. This watch served as a
means to forget the passing of time and to cast away her deep thoughts.

“It must be a precious item.”

“Mother gave it to me.”

“…I see.”

She used the term ‘Mother’ instead of ‘Her Majesty the Empress.’ Merlin
immediately understood the reason.

That pocket watch was undoubtedly a gift from the Empress to White as a
‘mother.’

Feeling an inexplicable tingling and heaviness inside, Merlin quietly
looked out the window.

The darkened Arkins Sea. It was a very familiar scene for Merlin, who
once graduated from the Knight Department of Märchen Academy.

She reflected on the mission entrusted to her, It was just one: to
protect Princess Snow White.

She vowed to the moonlight and Arkins Sea under the darkness to surely
protect this kind and lovely princess.

But then…

“Hehe… he…”

White laughed, sounding as if she had a screw loose.

She looked at the pocket watch while laughing eerily as if she had lost
her mind.

‘Did she say it dispels random thoughts…?’

The effect of the pocket watch seemed better than expected.

\*\*\*

A floor with a chess pattern of black and red.

The dark ceiling had sporadic lights of unknown origin shining down.

The red walls, which were adorned with patterns of black thorny vines
forming elegant curves, were spotlessly clean.

The walls were lined with various clocks, all hung in a haphazard,
slanted manner.

In that space, among the sparsely placed furniture, four people were
seated.

Spatial magic, Alice’s Labyrinth. Inside the Realm independently created
by Alice Carroll.

The four people were each waiting for the person they served to arrive.

*Click-clack.*

As the sound of shoes echoed from one darkened side, the attention of
all four shifted in that direction.

But what appeared was only a fat purple cat wearing ill-fitting large
shoes.

\[Meow\~. Thought I was Alice?\]

“…Cheshire.”

A serious, bespectacled male student, sitting with his arms and legs
crossed, glared fiercely at Cheshire. His voice was sharp.

On the back of his left hand, a navy blue spade symbol, simply depicting
a shovel, was emitting a faint light.

A Paladin’s mark. Covered by a black glove, its light was blurry.

“Kyahaha! Cheshire, what’s with that look? Totally doesn’t suit you!”

\[Meoow!! I don’t want to hear that from you, Shera!\]

On the backrest of a red sofa…

A cute girl named Shera, wearing red heart-shaped earrings and a
charming golden heart hairpin, was precariously seated.

She laughed heartily, then toppled over backward along with the sofa.

*Thud.* A single cry of “eek” rang out, and the laughter abruptly
stopped.

“Why did you come and not the Queen?”

A kind-looking boy asked in a gentle tone. He was wearing a tie pin with
a green three-leaf clover symbol, representing peace.

\[Well, I’m just here to deliver a message and leave. There’s no need
for Alice to come, right?\]

“…”

A female student with a yellow diamond symbol on her forehead leaned
against the wall, looking indifferently at Cheshire. She seemed like a
girl who would normally lack courage.

Meanwhile, the heart girl quickly got up, set the fallen sofa upright
again, then put her arms on the backrest to support her chin.

She couldn’t contain her excitement, bouncing slightly. Her uplifted
mood was evident. A smile of anticipation filled her face.

\[Well then, this is Alice’s message. I assume you understood everything
last time, so I’ll just convey the essentials.\]

The spade boy adjusted his glasses and stood up.

The heart girl ran excitedly to the front of the sofa with a broad
smile.

The clover boy stood next to the spade boy with a thoughtful expression.

The diamond girl moved away from the wall to stand beside the heart
girl.

Thus, the four stood in an orderly line before the strange Cheshire,
ready to hear Alice’s message.

Cheshire, with a smile, flung off the shoes it was wearing.

\[First, hinder the Black Monster. Second, uncover the identity of the
Black Monster. Third, eliminate the Black Monster. That is your mission
as Paladins. Remember, it’s an enemy too strong to be taken down
head-on, even if all of you combine your powers. So, discreetly and
meticulously… eliminate them.\]

The four Paladins crossed their left hands behind their backs and placed
their right hands on their chests, bowing their heads.

And they all spoke the same words.

***Everything as per the Queen’s will.***

\* \* \*

Morning. The middle-lower dorm, Briggs Hall.

Leaning on the window frame with arms crossed, feeling the cool winter
breeze. The quiet landscape of the school grounds was in view.

In the left hand was a cup of freshly brewed hot coffee, and in the
right, \[Frostfire\] was habitually conjured. It was a routine to shake
off morning drowsiness.

Taking a sip of the hot coffee, I felt my foggy and blurry mind
gradually clear up.

“Haa…”

A deep breath turned into white mist, scattering in the cold wind.

***Time to organize my thoughts.***

Alice brought the four Paladins to capture me. Every single one of them
was extremely powerful, so I couldn’t defeat them with mere force.

Then, how should I deal with them?

I’d like to just take my beloved characters and beat them all, but…

Attacking those who were not yet suspects would only make me and them
criminals, and I’d be expelled from the academy and that would be the
end.

The better approach was to gather evidence that Alice was in collusion
with the demons and that the Paladins were her subordinates, and then
direct the suspicion toward them…

‘It’s not easy.’

Alice was meticulous and she had never done anything conspicuous.

Moreover, with Cheshire around, it was difficult to unravel her secrets
using \[Clairvoyance\].

Perhaps, I couldn’t avoid being involved with the Paladins in my second
year.

Suddenly…

\[Here comes the valiant killer whale, Bello!\]

“…?”

While drinking coffee and immersed in thought, suddenly a small killer
whale magic beast, wrapped in water mana, flew in front of me. It was
Bello.

\[Isaac! I have a message for you! My master wishes to personally go on
a date with you, so get dressed and come out at once-kahaaak!\]

*Splaaash!*

A powerful water cannon blast sent Bello blasting off again.

Looking down where the water magic was shot out, a woman with rose-gold
hair stood in front of the dorm, extending her arms and unfolding a
magic circle.

She quickly dissipated the magic circle.

Seeing that her first thought was to eliminate her familiar, who had
blurted out absurdities loudly, rather than unsummoning him, it seemed
she was in quite a hurry.

“Luce?”

Luce Eltania waved at me when our eyes met. She was smiling awkwardly,
perhaps embarrassed.

Today was the day I was asked to be Luce’s sparring partner and training
assistant for the whole day.

***Isn’t it too early for that?***

‘Not that I mind, though.’

On the snowy path. Luce, bathed in the morning sunlight, looked
incredibly beautiful.

Eager to go to her, I thoughtlessly gulped down the steaming hot coffee.
It was bitter and hot. I was supposed to have let it cool down, ah.
Belatedly, I crudely cooled my burnt mouth with ice magic.

\[Kahak! Bello is shocked by Master’s tyranny! No violence! No
violence!\]

After turning my back on Bello, who was spinning in the air and
protesting with a voice like that of a young boy, I got ready to go out.

I left the dorm.

Luce was waiting with a smiling face.

\*\*\*

\[Potential in \[Growth Rate\] has reached MAX!\] \[Your perseverance
and effort will surely be rewarded…\] \[Congratulations! You have
acquired the unique Trait \[Rapid Growth\]!\]

Year 2 at Märchen Academy had begun.

<span id="0134_136_Mentor_Isaac_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 136: Mentor Isaac (1)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (1) ༻**

‘In the end, I got admitted…’

The sound of birds chirping. Sparrows, which had vanished to avoid the
winter cold, had returned.

Spring morning. It was the day of the entrance ceremony for new students
at Märchen Academy.

The ceremony opened grandly, and the freshmen, neatly gathered in the
academy square in their uniforms, were reflecting on their ambitions and
resolutions.

Among them, the main characters had already been decided.

There were three presences, whose status was unreasonably high and
practically reigned above the law. These girls, surrounded by their
escorts, participated in the ceremony, detached from the other students.

Imperial Princess, Snow White Von Kairos Elfieto.

Saintess, Bianca Anturaze.

Priestess, Miya.

The sight of the three main characters, who didn’t seem interrelated at
all, in the same uniform was a strange scene for the other students.

The news of their enrollments had spread widely in the Zelver Empire.

Because of this, the atmosphere was tense among this batch of students,
but as the girls in their uniforms appeared, everyone was awestruck.

They were the very epitome of beauty. Fitting for their roles as global
protagonists, the Imperial Princess, the Saintess, and the Priestess
each displayed their incredible allure.

In the midst of this, tears welled up in Princess Snow White’s eyes. She
felt despair.

─‘Well done, Snow White! Use this opportunity to become independent and
a person befitting the Imperial Family! Kahahahah!”

‘Your Imperial Majesty…’

The hearty voice of Emperor Carlos often echoed in White’s head. In the
face of his smiling face, she didn’t have the courage to persuade him to
let her give up on enrolling.

And to rub even more salt into an already bad wound…

‘Last place…’

She was given the title of being last in the Magic Department’s entrance
exam. It was a blow to her dignity.

She actually had quite a bit of confidence in her abilities, but per
usual, exam results could only be assured after they were revealed.

The students admitted to this academy were all geniuses with exceptional
talents.

They were White’s competitors, fitting the reputation of the continent’s
best academy.

And when taking this into account, she had almost failed the entrance
exam.

***Or maybe failing wouldn’t have been so bad…***

No. If she hadn’t passed she couldn’t even imagine how much she would
have to walk on eggshells in the Imperial Household.

White’s feelings were complex.

“The next event will be the recitation of the declaration. Freshman
Representative, Miya. Come forward.”

The Priestess, Miya, with her black pearl-colored braids flowing down,
stood in front of the podium. Her face was relaxed and smiling, a stark
contrast to White.

After all, between White and Miya was the extreme gap between first and
last place.

White furrowed her brows. She held the title of ‘last place’; how was
she supposed to become friends with this Priestess, whose character was
considerably lacking, for the future of the empire and the world…?

‘It would be a relief if, at the very least, I’m not mocked or taken
lightly.’

It would be a fortunate in and of itself if she were not looked down on.

…It was just overwhelming. What could she even do?

In the meantime…

After finishing the declaration recitation, Priestess Miya glanced at
Princess Snow White and Saintess Bianca Anturaze.

‘The Imperial Princess of Zelver and the Saintess of the Helize Church…’

In Märchen Academy, the gap in social status tended to lessen
considerably.

This was because there was a custom of treating each other equally as
students who had entered the academy to learn.

However, it wasn’t clear whether it would have a real effect, as, in the
end, the position of a person would never change.

In the first place, even in the academy, the Priestess herself was given
special treatment. In essence, when someone had a high enough status,
they couldn’t be treated equally even if people wanted them to be.

It was the same for the Princess and the Saintess. They were both women
with immense influence worldwide.

Priestess Miya decided to keep an eye on them. Just as she was now, she
intended to surpass them and raise the status of her country, the Land
of the Fire Blossoms-Horan, and her title as the Priestess.

“…?”

Princess Snow White quickly turned her head away as soon as she made eye
contact with Miya.

She seemed to be full of worries, as her trembling figure clearly
highlighted. Miya recalled the day of the entrance exam.

When Miya had kicked a male student down the stairs, she had looked at
her with a face filled with terror.

It was a moment that had stayed in her memory because it was the first
time she had made eye contact with the Princess.

Miya decided to reconsider. Perhaps the Princess was not someone she
needed to be wary of.

\*\*\*

The result had already occurred and the weight on her shoulders was
heavy.

Princess Snow White had to do whatever she could for the future of her
country. She was an Imperial Princess, after all.

“Is Your Highness really okay?”

“My resolve has not changed, Merlin…! Now is the right time.”

First mission. Befriend Priestess Miya.

Today was her first day at Märchen Academy.

Soon after the class assignment evaluations, Snow White would go to
Class D, and Priestess Miya to Class A.

As cliques and friend groups were mainly determined in the early days
after enrollment, White had decided to use this period to her advantage.

On this momentous first day of enrollment, Princess White, while having
a meal in the student cafeteria, looked at Priestess Miya and swallowed
hard.

Soon, the students began to murmur. Conversations like, ‘The Princess
and the Priestess are in the same place…’ or ‘I never thought I’d see
such a scene in my life’, were exchanged among them.

The mere fact that the Princess and the Priestess were together in the
same area was historically rare.

Merlin approached White, cautiously observing the students, and covered
her mouth with her hand before speaking.

“Princess, let me carry your tra-”

“No, I’ll carry it.”

“Excuse me?”

“I can’t always be spoon-fed.”

Merlin suddenly felt sentimental.

“…You’ve grown, Princess White.”

“I-I wasn’t so hopeless that merely carrying a tray by myself can be
considered growth, you know?!”

Emperor Carlos’ command was to become independent. White wasn’t exactly
averse to this.

Having enrolled at Märchen Academy, she decided that she might as well
use this period as an opportunity for growth.

Still, hearing that she had grown just by carrying a tray made White
feel embarrassed. How had people been evaluating her all this time?

“Well, then.”

“I know… We… have to… eat together…!”

Holding the tray with both hands, White gave a determined look in the
direction of Priestess Miya.

Regardless of White’s resolve, Miya continued to indifferently eat her
food, utterly unimpressed, with her escort wizard behind her.

“…”

Now that she was actually trying to eat with her, a sensation of
feathers tickling her chest could be felt.

It was scary. But thinking about making friends in this new environment
made White’s cheeks flush from her fluttering heart, as she chewed on
her lips in anticipation.

No matter how shitty a person’s character may be, surely there must be a
reason why this Priestess was revered by the people of the Land of the
Fire Blossoms-Horan.

‘It’s possible. Maybe she’s actually a good person.’

White believed in the innate goodness of people. And that proved just
how far she was from the brutal power struggles that usually occurred
when it came to people of her stature.

White got lost in her imagination.

She imagined getting acquainted with Priestess Miya over a meal…

And interacting during classes and exams…

Then somehow, they would gradually find common ground and similarities,
thus opening up to each other.

Eventually, she would realize that Priestess Miya also had a good side
to her, which would allow White to treat her well without any hesitation
or doubt.

‘The bloom of pure youth…!’

Immersed in such thoughts, White felt her mood improve rapidly. Becoming
friends with the Priestess didn’t seem too bad.

***Yeah, it’ll be alright.***

***Peace for the empire and the world? Let’s put that aside for now.***

She just needed to be Snow White Von Kairos Elfieto and get along with
her classmate, Miya.

Only then could White let go of her worries. Her fearful, tense
expression softened and a relaxed smile appeared on her lips.

‘Oh…!’

White’s escort knight, Merlin Astrea, was amazed. She started to feel a
sense of ease from White.

Well, then. This was White’s first step.

With light steps, she approached Miya, who was still eating, and…

“Euheuk!”

*Splat!*

“….”

“…”

She tumbled forward, spilling the contents of the tray all over Miya.

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

Miya’s hand, holding a fork, froze. Hot mushroom soup dripped down her
black-jade hair, as white steam rose.

The food stuck to Miya’s uniform, smearing it with its own seasoning and
oil.

The students, the escort wizards of the Land of the Fire Blossoms, and
Merlin all watched the scene with wide eyes of disbelief.

White, groaning in pain from the fall, realized what she had done and
her face turned deathly pale.

In the silent student cafeteria, White, sitting on the floor, got up
hastily, her trembling arms flailing.

“I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I I’m s-so s-s-s-s-sor… No, I mean, sorry…! I-I didn’t
mean to do it on purpo-”

“Mmm…”

*Lick.* Miya scooped the soup that had spilled on her head with her
finger and licked it.

Her gentle eyes, painted with red eyeliner, turned towards White.

Then, Miya suddenly smirked.

“…How fun.”

At that single remark. White’s heart sank.

The escort wizard immediately stood up to wipe Miya with a handkerchief,
but she stopped him with her hand. Because she only wore a smile that
seemed to imply it was fine, it actually unnerved the onlookers even
more.

Dripping with soup, Miya stood up.

“It was a memorable greeting. I like it, Snow White.”

That look in her eyes.

She was just looking for an opportunity to kill her. There was no doubt
about it.

With a pale face full of fear, akin to a reindeer caught among a pack of
beasts, White’s entire body trembled as if she were a patient with
malaria.

Miya left with her escort wizard.

And White stood there, dazed, as if her soul had left her body.

“Her Highness just got the drop on the Priestess…!”

“Was she trying to show the difference in national power?”

“Princess White…. She is much more terrifying than she looks.”

“It was a strategic tray spill…!”

The students were thrilled.

White turned to Merlin, who was standing behind her.

Her expression seemed to plead for help. However, Merlin, grasping her
chin, couldn’t utter a single word.

Tears welled up in the corner of White’s eyes.

***…She’s royally screwed.***

Chapter 137: Mentor Isaac (1)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (2) ༻**

Grade S Mana.

Results of the Class Placement Evaluation, 1st place.

Guaranteed to be in Class A.

Those were the grades of Miya, the Priestess.

Grade D+ Mana.

Results of the Class Placement Evaluation, 1st place from the back.

Guaranteed to be in Class D.

Those were the grades of Princess Snow White.

“Merlin, life is such a futile thing…”

“I’ve already heard you say that six times, Your Highness.”

Snow White has heard the others claiming she was part of the Golden
Generation. Not only were the Princess, Saintess, and Priestess all in
the same grade, but the other freshmen were also much more talented than
usual.

***But even so, this… Aren’t they a bit too talented?***

Snow White realized after coming here that she, who received an elite
education from only the most distinguished of people due to her
background as a princess, had merely been a big frog in a small pond.

She had mistaken herself to be truly talented after hearing countless
compliments from a high-ranking wizard in an exalted magic tower such as
‘Well done.’ and ‘You’re brilliant.’ But reality was saddening.

Inside of an empty classroom within Orphin Hall, the building for the
Department of Magic.

In front of the lectern, White was staring vacantly into space sitting
in a chair prepared for her, and placed in front of her was another
empty chair.

Aside from White and Merlin Astrea standing behind her, nobody else was
inside of the classroom.

“Don’t you think I’m quite pathetic…? I’ve already declared to His
Majesty the Emperor that I would do my best, but I’ve already started on
the wrong foot with the Priestess, and am far behind in ability from
both her and the Saintess… I haven’t even come across the Saintess, let
alone had the chance to talk with her…”

“There’s no need to be discouraged. Your Highness has a kind heart.
There will come a chance for Your Highness to acquaint them.”

***A kind heart. Is that really her only redeeming quality?***

With a soft sigh, White smiled ruefully. Merlin judged that now was the
time to change the topic.

“By the way, the mentor should be coming any moment now.”

“Merlin, you said that the mentoring program didn’t exist when you were
attending this academy, correct?”

“Yes. I heard that it is being implemented for the first time this
year.”

The mentoring program.

It was a program that the Märchen Academy was newly implementing.

Freshmen who wished to participate were assigned a random senior student
as a mentor. The chosen senior would provide them with help and advice
regarding school activities.

Of course, the seniors also needed to sign up in advance to become a
mentor.

Students who became mentors were given a scholarship benefit for part of
their tuition fee and received an additional sum in proportion to how
much the grades of their freshman mentees improved.

But because of the risks, such as how this was a newly implemented
program or it was unclear how much the activities would affect one’s own
school life, there were not many volunteers for the mentors.

“Do you think there will be someone fit for me…? Someone that has risen
from the bottom to the top in a short period of time… That criterion.
Thinking about it now, I think that may have been a bit too unreasonable
of a request.”

“We will see soon. If it doesn’t seem to work out, then Your Highness
can just withdraw from the mentoring program later. There’s no need to
think too hard about it.”

Since a mentee needed a mentor fit for them, they were able to add
desired criteria for their mentor.

White also submitted her wishes for who would be her ideal mentor.

It was ‘the person with the largest improvement in grades last year’.

White did not need a mentor who had been talented and strong from the
start like Merlin.

A fitting mentor for her would be someone who had started with a low
grade just like her, and then was able to earn higher grades over time.

Her current grades were incredibly low. So she had to bring up her
grades as quickly as possible and display power that would be able to
impress the Saintess and Priestess at least a little bit. After all, the
first step to becoming acquainted with them was to be able to at least
compete with them.

That would be her way to contribute to the future of her nation and the
peace of the world.

“Your Highness, I believe they are here.”

“What? How do you know that?”

“I can hear their footsteps. Someone is coming this way.”

“But I cannot hear anything… Just how good is your hearing, Merlin?”

Finally.

With a creak, the door opened, and a boy stepped into the classroom.

“…”

Silence. Holding her breath, White peered intently at the senior student
who entered her vision.

He was in a school uniform, a blue jeweled brooch signifying the second
year hanging on his necktie.

His silver hair was just slightly wavy, and his eyes were a shade of
murky crimson.

The large circular glasses he wore gave her the impression that he was a
model student.

His expression made her believe he would have a gentle personality.
Admittedly, her senior seemed decently good-looking.

“You are…?”

“It is my honor to meet Your Highness the Princess.”

Standing in front of White, the student placed his hand over his chest
and politely bowed.

The two girls stared at him, White with a blank gaze, and Merlin with an
inspective one.

“I am Isaac, your newly selected mentor. I hope that we will have a
meaningful semester together.”

The student with silver hair, Isaac, greeted them with a bright smile
that reminded one of a salesman.

They called it the capitalistic smile.

\* \* \*

Everything went according to plan.

Snow White.

I just call her the lousy princess.

She takes a main role in the episode during Year 2 Semester 2, and it
was practically a guaranteed bad ending if she died.

So it was necessary to build close relations with her in advance and
lower her guard so that I could protect her.

I had three ideas for how I could become close to White, and I planned
to use all three of those methods.

For starters,

‘The mentoring program.’

The mentoring program was a mandatory section of the ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ scenario storyline.

Normally, Ian Fairytale would have been the one chosen as Princess
White’s mentor, since as the main character, he was the ‘student with
the largest improvement in grades’.

Since White was a side character, not a heroine, she barely contributed
anything to the story during Year 2 Semester 1.

But after becoming close with Ian, she provided a chance for him to
shine in the second semester.

However, in this world, there wasn’t even the slightest possibility of
Ian being able to protect White.

Not to mention…

‘In this world, I had the biggest improvement.’

This world had me.

If someone asked among my peers who had the most drastic of improvements
in their year, they would all definitely say ‘Isaac’.

Which was why I had been certain that I would become White’s mentor if I
volunteered for the mentoring program.

Behind White, who had fair skin and pure white hair, was Merlin Astrea
with her light green hair tied back into a ponytail. Her eyes inspected
me with a gaze similar to that of a hawk.

But there was no such thing as a crack in my smile. My specialty was in
the acting field; being able to cry on cue was easy for me.

Maintaining my natural smile, I waited for White and Merlin to lower
their guard.

Just for reference, Merlin was Kaya Astrea’s sister and a likable side
character. She was also the side character I wanted to form the deepest
connection with after White.

That was because of the Obsidian Blade, the legendary rock element
weapon.

The stance was important when using the Obsidian Blade’s skills. Merlin,
a genius swordsman, would definitely be a good teacher for me. If I
become close with White, I will likely be able to ask some favors to
Merlin as well. That was part of my plan.

“S-senior Isaac! This is the academy, and you’re my senior…! There’s no
need to upkeep such formalities!”

White leaped from her seat after receiving my salutations, waving her
hands frantically in a panic.

She acted and spoke just as one would expect from a girl who was staying
far away from the power struggle for the crown.

“W-well, nice to meet you! I’m sure you already know, but my name is
Snow White Von Kairos Elfieto. You can call me White for short.”

“As you wish, Princess White.”

“By the way Senior Isaac, would it be rude for me to ask about your
grades last year…?”

White asked me carefully, bringing up both of her hands around her
mouth.

As expected, that was her first question.

“I started as the lowest-placed student in Class D, and am currently the
highest-ranking student of Class B.”

“Perfect!!”

White, the current bottom-ranked student in Class D for the first
year’s, cheered joyfully.

It was as if she had just found a ray of light inside of the pit of
despair she had fallen into.

\*\*\*

White, Merlin, and I crossed the campus.

White was a princess of the Zelver Empire.

Not only that but after dumping her food tray onto the Priestess as
written in the original scenario, she attracted far too much attention
from the other students.

Attention from others was a disturbance to training. So I planned to
train her somewhere away from others.

***Why train her at all?***

There were many reasons.

As her mentor, I held responsibility for White’s growth, and White had
to become stronger anyway to prevent the bad ending.

And it was beneficial for me to be exposed to the mana that White was
going to use.

“From last place in Class D to first in Class B…! How is that
possible?!”

White had seemed excited this entire time. It looked like she was deeply
invested in my story as the current bottom-ranked student in Class D.

For reference, the classes were chosen by taking both the maximum mana
and the score for the class placement evaluation into consideration.
There was an absolute benchmark chart.

There was not much of a difference in skill between me and Keridna
Whiteclark, who was fifth place in Class A.

But because she had a slightly higher maximum mana than me, I arrived at
my final rank as top of Class B.

In reality, ‘Isaac is at a similar skill level as the Class A students’
was the majority’s opinion. That was basically my current position.

Anyhow, I smiled awkwardly, pretending to be embarrassed.

“It’s just a result of hard work. I’m sure that Princess White will do
much better than a commoner such as myself.”

“Ah, humility! Yes, this is the sort of person that I wanted!”

It seemed like White was burning with enthusiasm right now. I had to
say, it was cute to see her fist balled up determinedly telling me that
she wanted to receive my coaching as soon as possible.

Though it was called the mentoring program, our relationship was likely
going to become similar to a teacher and student. White was, after all,
not in a state where just any ol’ advice would be enough.

Like a personal trainer, I would need to teach her proper methods of
training.

But that didn’t mean that I was going to pour all of my time into White.
I planned to adjust the schedule so that it would not interfere with my
own training, and there were other things I would be able to gain from
her.

It was a give-and-take.

“By the way, Senior, you don’t need to use honorifics. This is the
academy. I’ll only feel uncomfortable if you continue to talk to me so
formally…”

“Ah, well then… Alright.”

I was waiting for her to tell me that. I quickly dropped the formalities
before things became awkward.

White was continuing to grin ear to ear, seeming to be in a good mood. I
must have seemed like some rope that could pull her up to a higher
level.

Well, that was true. Though I was going to make her work that much
harder for it.

We ventured deep into the hydrangea gardens and made a turn into a
secluded path, then finally arrived at the corner of the hydrangea
gardens. There was a small lake nearby.

Though this place was smaller than the corner of the butterfly gardens
that I often used, this should still be wide enough.

“This is?”

“A corner of the hydrangea gardens. There are probably not many people
who know this place aside from myself. We’ll be able to train at peace
here.”

“Merlin, have you ever come here before?”

“No, there wasn’t really a reason for me to come to a place like this.”

That was likely. The Märchen Academy’s campus was as large as it was
secretive.

Not only that, but the island itself was huge as well, so it was likely
that the majority of students would have seen less of the island than
what they had seen before graduating.

“White.”

“Yes, Senior Isaac.”

“You’ll be training only for about two hours a day from now on. This is
all for your improvement. You can endure that much, right?”

“Heh, 2 hours? That’s a piece of cake!”

White responded eagerly, her face full of confidence.

Then, 20 minutes later.

“Gaghhh…!”

“Your Highness!”

White collapsed on the ground from exhaustion.

<span id="0136_138_Mentor_Isaac_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 138: Mentor Isaac (3)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (3) ༻**

“U-until now… I’ve been training the wrong way…”

On the way back after two hours of hellish training.

I lent White Zhonya’s staff. She held it with both hands, leaning on it
to steady herself as she staggered forward.

“Princess, I think it’s better if you let me support you…”

“No, don’t… Ugh. If I don’t get through this on my own… there’s no
point…”

Merlin offered to help her several times, but White, determined to
develop self-reliance, quickly refused.

An admirable attitude.

“Senior… Isaac.”

“Yes.”

“I’ll be in your care… tomorrow as well… Ugh.”

Suddenly, I was reminded of the time right after my possession into this
world. I received hellish personal training from the Knight Department
students every single day. Back then, I had to constantly crawl to my
dorm.

It seemed like I was looking at myself from that time, and a smirk
appeared on my face.

Certainly, I understood their feelings. It was quite endearing.

\*\*\*

“As you repeatedly gather and release mana, the mana circuit is
reconstructed into a more robust form. Gradually the flow of mana
accelerates, and the mana circuit adapts, thus being able to withstand
it, resulting in the gradual increase of both the quality and the
quantity of mana.”

“I-I’m aware of that, but oh…”

“Let’s do this part again… No, that’s not it. The magic circle should be
like this. Three strokes are wrong. The stroke here should be ‘Geummu’,
but what you drew is ‘Jeya’. ‘Geummu’ has a more twisted form like this…
Draw it this way. It’s better to keep the intensity of the mana release
at this level. Now, follow along.”

“I-I feel like I’m going to die, Senior Isaac…”

The next day, at a corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

As I lifted my round glasses and explained, White made a distressed
face.

“One more time like this. Try to create wind one more time.”

“Huaaah…!”

*Whooooosh─!*

“Good. Now, another one.”

“Huah!”

“Good, do it again just like that.”

“Huek…!”

“That’s the spirit. One more time.”

“Hyaah…!”

Despite struggling, White followed my instructions without complaint.

I also repeatedly casted rock magic, so it seemed that White didn’t even
feel like picking a fight with me.

For your information, my repetition of the magic wasn’t just for
demonstration. Even while teaching White, I didn’t want to neglect my
own training.

“Huuh…! Ah!”

Blood trickled from White’s nose.

I knew this would happen. I quickly approached White, gently grabbed the
back of her head, and pressed a handkerchief that I had prepared earlier
to her nose.

“Are you okay?”

“…!”

White shuddered and looked at me with wide eyes.

Merlin, who had been leaning against a tree, started to come over with a
shocked face but stopped when White extended her arm to stop her.

“…It’s like you were prepared for this in advance.”

Because of the handkerchief pressed against her nose, White’s voice
sounded nasal.

“Senior Isaac, you’ve also been through a lot of this, haven’t you?”

“That happens when you overuse mana. It’s unavoidable. But doing this
improves skills quickly, got it? If you overdo it, the mana circuit can
break, but I can gauge it until just before that point, so don’t worry.”

***I know the limit quite well, having broken it a few times myself.***

“Senior…”

White gazed at me with a look of pity.

“You… must have struggled a lot…”

It was an unexpected reaction. I had expected her to be panicking and
disoriented from the nosebleed, but instead, White appeared calm.

“It’s all part of the process.”

I smirked and passed the handkerchief to White. She firmly pressed the
handkerchief against her upper lip.

“Let’s take a little break.”

“Yesss…!”

“Wanna have one? It’s good for mana recovery.”

“Oh! Mana Pudding Bar…! I’d love to…!”

I unwrapped the Mana Pudding Bar and handed it to White. It was a
pudding-textured snack effective for mana recovery.

It was released this semester and it was quite famous among students, as
stores prominently advertised it as being good for mana recovery.

However, its effect was minimal for someone with a low mana amount like
White. In other words, it was false advertising. So, the claim that it
helps with mana recovery was a scam.

However, this kind of lie might lead White to believe that ‘my mana is
rapidly recovering,’ which could aid her mental stability and
potentially motivate her to train even harder, much like the placebo
effect.

Above all, it was very tasty. I didn’t particularly favor it because
eating too many sweets could make the body sluggish and interfere with
training.

Despite her exhaustion, White seemed to be quite delighted with the
sweet snack, smiling happily as she was about to take a bite of the Mana
Pudding Bar.

“Princess.”

“…!”

Then, Merlin stepped forward to take the first bite, as a precaution in
case it contained anything poisonous.

No matter who the other person was, caution was necessary.

With a disappointed expression, White handed over the pudding bar, and
Merlin gobbled up almost half of it in one bite.

“Waaaah…!!”

A cry tinged with tears erupted from White’s mouth, but Merlin, unfazed,
simply said, “No problem here,” and walked away nonchalantly.

Tears welled up in White’s eyes. She made a sad face as she nibbled on
the remains of the pudding bar.

“It’s tasty…”

Her expression was dazed and her voice sad.

The sweet but brief rest period ended, and we resumed our training.

“White, one more time!”

“Kraaah…!”

*Thud.*

A moment later, White collapsed to the ground from exhaustion.

\*\*\*

The spring sky was luminous with the hues of sunset.

After finishing the hellish magic PT, White, again using the Zhonya’s
staff I lent her, walked out limping like a person with a slipped disc.

Thus, we were leaving the Hydrangea Garden. It had been our routine for
several days.

Today, as well, she had fallen several times; her uniform was dirty, and
some dirt had clung to her pure white hair.

Passing students glanced at us and whispered. Her appearance at the
moment would have one question whether she was actually a princess or
not.

Maintaining the dignity of a princess was important too, but it seemed
that White lacked the capacity to do so at this time.

‘It makes sense.’

She must have never struggled this much before. The elites who taught
White would have gone easy on her, while mindful of power dynamics.

Merlin was fidgety, worrying that White might fall. I might as well have
felt pity for her too.

“Senior Isaac.”

“Hmm?”

“Developing skills like yours… though I expected it, it’s really tough…
But these days, thanks to you, my mana is flowing much better. I feel
like I’m getting stronger…!”

“You’re doing well. Just keep it up.”

White looked at me and bit her lip. It seemed like she was trying to
hold back a smile that wanted to burst out from my praise.

As the training continued, I saw through \[Psychological Insight\] that
White was filled with ‘admiration’. It seems I looked impressive to her
for rapidly growing through such repeated hardships.

‘Though I rely on Status Window.’

***Without the Status Window, I would have certainly hit my limits. I
don’t deserve such admiration.***

On the other hand, White had not yet undergone proper training. Once she
really got rolling, she had ample potential to grow to great heights.

After all, the blood of royalty was not in vain.

Moreover, White’s hidden power was also a key that could sway the
「Fairy War」. There was a reason why her death directly led to a bad
ending.

‘I can’t do this without White.’

I intended to grow White, protect her, and defeat any enemy to prevent a
bad ending at all costs.

Additionally, I could benefit from exposure to the mana she emanated,
like a plant photosynthesizing in the sunlight. To become stronger more
efficiently, I needed her.

“Um, Senior Isaac. Is there anything you want?”

“Anything I want? Why are you asking all of a sudden?”

***That’s unexpected.***

“I’m in a position where I have to rely on gel, so I can’t give much
right now… but I still want to repay you someday. Thanks to you, I’m
getting stronger!”

“Oh, if that’s the case, there’s something I’d like to ask for.”

“Puhuh! You didn’t hesitate at all…!”

There was no need to refuse. I too had to take what I could get.

“Go ahead and ask. I’ll grant what I can. What is it?”

“Just occasionally.”

I pointed at Merlin Astrea, White’s escort knight.

“Lend me this person for a while.”

Merlin Astrea.

She was the daughter of the Sword Saint and a genius in weaponry. As
mentioned earlier, if I were to receive swordsmanship training from her,
I could freely handle the Obsidian Blade’s skill. Truly the best
teacher.

Ah, it would be good to learn some basic scythe skills during this
opportunity. I should focus on magic training, so I couldn’t invest much
in weaponry, but still.

“Ah, Merlin? Of course… What? Wait, you can’t do that…!!”

White was horrified, and Merlin looked at me with a contemptuous
expression.

***…It’s not what you’re thinking. Please don’t misunderstand.***

\* \* \*

“He seems to be having fun…”

Atop the Märchen Academy building, a girl wearing a witch’s hat perched
precariously on the railing. Pressing down her hat, she grumbled while
looking towards the Hydrangea Garden.

Her long, violet hair, tied only at the ends, fluttered in the spring
breeze, reflecting the hues of the sunset.

It was Dorothy Heartnova.

\[Why don’t you just go and talk to him?\]

When Ella, a white cat familiar lying beside her, asked this, Dorothy
shook her head and dangled her legs.

“A mentoring system? I’ve heard they have something like that. I can’t
disturb the President. Moreover, with the mentee being a princess, how
can I… mess with her”

\[You’ve become too timid. Just ask him, ‘Mentee or me?’ and it would be
over.\]

“Hey cat, if I cause trouble for the President, wouldn’t that be bad?”

\[More importantly, since when do you care about status? Isn’t your
style more like a headstrong boar?\]

Dorothy huffed in derision and smugly placed her hand on her chest.

“How silly, where would you find a lady as demure as me? If you want a
metaphor to truly encapsulate my essence, use an elegant swan, not a
boar.”

\[How fitting. But really, you did become more cautious lately, huh?\]

“I’ve always been like that.”

\[Full penalty points.\]

“Let’s not sweat the small stuff.”

\[Not so easily swayed, are you? What, did you have a change of heart
because you have to plan a future with Isaac and can’t afford to make
any more mistakes?\]

“…Nyahaha! Well, wow, what an imagination! To amaze me like that, you’re
amazing, Ella!”

***I hit the nail on the head. The way she denied it out of
embarrassment was nothing short of adorable.***

Ella chuckled, and then her face became serious as she got to the main
point.

\[…But really, what’s the true reason? The reason you’ve been secretly
watching Isaac lately.\]

Dorothy turned her head again towards Isaac.

He was walking out of the Hydrangea Garden, chatting amiably with
Princess Snow White and the escort knight Merlin Astrea.

“I sense something strange going on around the President.”

A prodigy said to have received the blessings of the Supreme Lord
Manhalla. The chosen girl who made a contract with Stella, the fairy of
the stars.

Dorothy’s mana perception was far superior to that of most geniuses.

She possessed an extraordinarily keen sense that allowed her to detect
unknown dangers to a certain extent. It was similar to how she had
intuitively sensed the arrival of The Floating Island last semester.

“I have a feeling that something is targeting the President. If it’s
dangerous… I’ll have to deal with it.”

Isaac was a very special existence to Dorothy.

She even owed him her life, so she was prepared to face death for him.

If there indeed was a being intending to harm him as she sensed.

Dorothy was ready to overturn anything, whether it be the academy,
authority, or the world, to prioritize protecting Isaac.

Ella sighed.

\[You’re such a romanticist.\]

“Puhuh! S-such a funny thing to say, really!”

At Ella’s words, Dorothy blushed and was greatly flustered. Her serious
demeanor didn’t last even 30 seconds.

Chapter 139: Mentor Isaac (4)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (4) ༻**

-He has become Princess Snow White’s mentor.

-Is it a coincidence?

5th seat of the second-year of Märchen Academy, Class A.

Keridna Whiteclark, the pink short-haired daughter of the Ducal
Whiteclark Family.

She was one of the select few who knew that Isaac was the Nameless Hero.

Following her older sister Aichel Whiteclark’s orders, Keridna was
recording every single rumor she had heard about Isaac.

Late into the night, in the top-ranked dorm, Charles Hall.

The glowing lamp on top of the desk shone a soft light through the dim
room.

Keridna closed the notebook where she had collected information about
Isaac and fell into deep thought. It was a question that she
contemplated over numerous times.

‘Why is my sister so obsessed with Isaac…?’

The Ducal Whiteclark Family was keeping watch over noble families with
their bloodline magic \[Sight Synchronization\].

Because of that, Keridna learned through Aichel that nobles from all
around the Zelver Empire had begun to move in the shadows, their actions
centralized on the Nameless Hero.

The Carnedas Family was especially suspicious. It was the family that
her peer and the third seat of Class A, Ciel Carnedas, was a part of.

Their strange behavior caused them to become the focus of Aichel’s
supervision.

The Nameless Hero, Isaac was currently an archwizard that the entire
world was keeping their eyes on.

If it became certain that he was on humanity’s side, then it was clear
that the entire world would begin competing fiercely to bring him to
their side.

But… The way in which Aichel Whiteclark obsessed over Isaac seemed
completely unrelated to the fact that he was the Nameless Hero.

Perhaps just as Isaac seemed to have many secrets, Aichel also had
secrets of her own. Secrets that she could not tell even Keridna, her
own sister.

“…”

Keridna gazed out the window. The sorrowful moon floated high up in the
night sky.

She had the feeling that something big was going to happen soon.

\*\*\*

Morning. Orphin Hall, building for the classes of the Magic Department.

Whilst passing through the hallway, Priestess Miya met with Princess
Snow White who was coming from the other side. They were both alone
since escorts weren’t allowed inside the hall unless the situation was
unavoidable.

White flinched in surprise when she met gazes with Miya, then shifted
her gaze elsewhere. She even seemed to be sweating for some reason.

Then, as if she made up her mind, White clenched her fists and nodded
firmly.

She stopped walking. Then with an awkward smile, waved at Miya while
saying hello.

The anxiety in her expression was clear in her forced smile.

“H-hey, there…?”

“…”

*Whoosh.*

Miya nonchalantly passed by White as if she didn’t see a thing.

White froze on the spot, her hand still raised mid-wave.

The distance between the two girls grew larger. The other students that
had been in the hallways stole glimpses at White and whispered among
themselves.

“Did you see that? Princess White just said ‘hi’ and got ignored by the
Priestess.”

“My goodness…”

“There’s a scary atmosphere between those two…”

The incident at the cafeteria where White dumped her food tray on Miya
had already been spread through the school like a legend.

As a result, the relationship of the two girls had already become a hot
topic among the students.

But White hadn’t heard even a bit of the student’s whispers.

‘She didn’t have to completely ignore me like that though…’

She felt as though she could cry.

All she had wanted was to become friends with her.

It pained White to experience this situation.

‘Snow White…’

Miya’s eyes, decorated with charming red makeup, narrowed into slits.

On their first day at the academy, she had underestimated White. White
had been trembling pathetically whenever anything would happen. So she
just thought of her as a wealthy pig at most.

But when White dumped that food tray onto her in the cafeteria, Miya had
been reminded of several facts.

Snow White was a princess of the Zelver Empire.

‘She has likely been in the center of a bloody battlefield for power
until now.’

It was well known among the other rulers that the fight for the position
of successor in the Zelver Empire was quite fierce. That was the
environment that Snow White had grown up in.

Not to mention, she heard that there had been a problem with the Empress
acting out within the imperial family.

The word was that the former Empress, who had been mentally ill,
secretly attempted to assassinate her own daughter several times. Miya
also knew that her daughter had been Snow White.

‘It’s impossible that a pig like her, who’s lived in a lavish-looking
battlefield like that of the Zelver Imperial Family, would be a naïve
scaredy-cat…’

It made much more sense for her to be a schemer wearing the mask of an
innocent lamb in order to survive whilst waiting for the opponent to
lower their guard.

‘Or maybe not.’

Of course, that thought was a mere possibility. It may just be her
overactive imagination at play. Miya believed in the theory that White
was actually just a naïve pig more than anything else.

Because of the usual lame attitude, she displayed… It could only be
considered real.

‘…I can figure it out later.’

Miya straightened her expression.

\*\*\*

“It is time for a special lesson.”

When Fernando Frost, a first-year professor for the Magic Department,
raised the megaphone and spoke into it, many female students blushed
with a blissful smile.

Inside a large classroom, all the first-year students of the Magic
Department were seated.

On top of the stage was Fernando, where he was continuing with the
special lesson.

“Today, you will all be learning about ‘Mana Release’. It is common
sense that the stronger you can release your mana, the more powerful
your spells will become. Therefore, we will begin the lesson after
letting each of you estimate just how much mana you can release.”

Fernando turned his head towards the waiting room next to the stage.

“Luce Eltania, please come forward.”

A girl walked out from the side of the stage.

She was wearing a student uniform with her rose-gold hair braided down
the sides. The butterfly-shaped hair ornament suited her well, and her
face was shockingly beautiful.

She stood next to Fernando and peered down at the first-year students.

The ribboned brooch on her uniform was blue, signifying her status as a
second-year.

The first-year students of the Magic Department collectively
concentrated their gazes on the girl, realizing that it was *the* Luce
Eltania. She was, after all, quite a renowned figure.

It was likely that almost everyone in this classroom admired her.

“That’s Luce Eltania…!”

Princess Snow White’s eyes sparkled with admiration.

“Luce Eltania…?”

And Priestess Miya’s eyes opened wide in bewilderment at Luce’s sudden
appearance.

On the other hand, Luce remained completely expressionless. As if she
had no interest in whether the first years gazed upon her with sparkling
eyes or not.

Then, Luce’s blue eyes began skirting quickly across the room and
stopped on one female student.

“H-huhh…?”

Princess Snow White’s eyes clashed in the air with Luce’s eyes. For a
moment she was excited, but after sensing a sinister malice that felt
like it would freeze her entire body, instinctive fear kicked into her
system. White’s body reflexively began to tremble.

To Luce, Princess White was a nuisance.

Because she was the one who had been spending time together with Isaac
every day recently under the excuse of that mentoring system or whatever
it was called. Luce despised the fact that she couldn’t spend as much
time with Isaac because of it.

“Luce, your mana.”

Under Fernando’s command.

Luce let out a deep sigh and closed her eyes, then slowly reopened them.

*Mmmwhooooshh——-!*

Her dense mana spread through the classroom like a powerful gust of
wind.

The first-year students all felt a chill run through their entire
bodies. The hairs on their neck stood on their ends. It was clear that
they were all surprised by the unbelievable mana that pressed against
their skin.

“Now, what you all have to do is simple. Push out your mana to the best
of your abilities and disrupt Luce Eltania’s mana. Your maximum mana
output will be measured. The records will become references for future
lessons and personal counseling, so it is encouraged that you give it
your all.”

After hearing Fernando’s instructions, the students swallowed nervously
and whispered to one another.

The students could see the mana’s solid formation.

***Just how high did her mana mastery have to be for such an intricate
structure?***

Not to mention that in front of such intense mana, the students were
caught up in a sense of inadequacy after realizing just how inferior
their mana was in comparison.

But attacking Luce’s mana was still a part of the lesson.

If not now, when would they ever have the chance to compare their
strength with the top seat?

Each of the first-year students began collecting their mana and then
poured it out towards Luce.

…Eventually, many of the students either ended up with nosebleeds or
collapsed from exhaustion. Significant time had passed since Princess
Snow White collapsed on top of the desk with her arms shaking.

Even after the fierce onslaught of the students’ mana, Luce’s mana
remained as sturdy as a steel wall, remaining unscathed.

Though all of the first-years in the room were born with talent, all
were equal before Luce’s unparalleled might.

On the other hand, Priestess Miya and the light pink-haired girl,
Saintess Bianca Anturaze, quietly observed Luce.

Fernando’s eyebrows furrowed as he turned to look at the two girls.

“Why are you two not even trying to disrupt it?”

“Because it’s clear that we will lose.”

Priestess Miya, who had her chin resting on her palm, casually tossed
back an answer to Fernando.

When Fernando signaled to Saintess Bianca, she merely nodded her head
with a benevolent smile.

Fernando let out a deep sigh. Though they were uncooperative with the
lesson, there was no reason to criticize them for not participating.
They merely had to deal with the consequences that would follow.

“Luce Eltania, you may withdraw your mana. Well done.”

Luce’s mana faded away. She soon walked off the stage.

The intimidating atmosphere within the classroom soon settled, but
pained aching sounds soon echoed all around. After all, most of the
students had released far too much mana and pushed themselves.

But Fernando began the lesson as if it didn’t matter. So the students
aside from the Priestess and the Saintess all listened to the lesson
while groaning like zombies.

\*\*\*

“Senior Luce Eltania, correct?”

“…?”

After class had ended.

Braided rose-gold hair. Butterfly-shaped hair ornament. Luce Eltania had
just left the school building and was walking down the path.

Nearby a red plum tree that was in bloom, Luce stopped when a female
student with loose pearl-black hair approached her.

The attractive red makeup around the female student’s soft eyes made
them seem more angular.

Seeing that she had an escort wizard in tow, she was likely someone of
high status. From what Luce knew, there were only three freshmen who
were permitted to have escorts among the students.

Looking at the red brooch on her uniform, she was a first-year student.

‘Ah, the Priestess.’

Luce figured out her identity immediately.

“I’m ‘Miya’. You should have seen me in the classroom earlier, but I
don’t know if you remembered me since there were so many other people.”

“…”

“I respect you, Senior. Personally, I like you.”

Miya leaned her body forward and brought her face closer to Luce, then
grinned.

“Huhu. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Senior Lu… Huh?”

Luce ignored the hand that Priestess Miya held out for a handshake and
continued walking.

She wanted to hurry and go see Isaac. It didn’t matter to Luce that this
black-haired freshman was the Priestess of the Eastern Nation.

The escort wizard seemed shocked, but Miya just tilted her head calmly
as if she had expected that to happen.

“She’s cold, just like the rumors say.”

Luce Eltania.

The one who owned the legendary magic beast, Thunderbird Galia as her
familiar, and had single-handedly protected Märchen Academy from the
Floating Island’s massive attacks.

That talent could only be described as overwhelming, and she was
currently the prominent top seat for the second years of the Magic
Department at Märchen Academy.

But it didn’t stop there. Luce was the dictionary definition of an ice
princess who didn’t speak with others and gave them a cold stare when
one attempted to speak with her.

“Where are you going? You won’t get anything good out of ignoring me.”

Luce only continued to walk instead of responding.

Seeing that, Miya gazed at Luce’s silhouette fading into the distance
with a smirk.

“Miss Miya?”

“I like her. I want her even more now.”

Miya brought a folded black fan up to her lips and blushed.

The escort wizard swallowed anxiously.

There had been several things that Priestess Miya had constantly spoken
about wanting while coming to the Märchen Academy.

The first was obviously the Nameless Hero.

Next were the top seats of each grade in the Magic Department, Luce
Eltania, and the Star Witch, Dorothy Heartnova.

In addition to the Nameless Hero, the rumors that had spread throughout
the continent and even to the Eastern Nation over the ocean were enough
to catch Miya’s attention.

Miya was the type who needed to claim what she wanted. If there was by
any chance a reason she could not claim something, then she went as far
as to remove that reason to claim what she wanted.

And right now, Miya had just said that she wanted Luce Eltania even
more.

Miya would be ready to do anything in order to make someone hers.

“Don’t you think it would be so wonderful if… Someone like her
submissively obeyed my orders and smiled only at me?”

Miya knew how to recognize people like Luce.

Those who had no such thing as blood or tears, and were cold-blooded
enough to remove whatever stood in their way for their benefit or
something they wanted.

That senior, Luce Eltania, was most definitely such a person.

Because.

“A cold, ice-hearted woman… one who treats others as trash and smiles at
nobody. I know that feeling. That person… They’re just like me.”

She was also one of them.

Those of the same kind were able to recognize one another.

“Heh.”

Miya secretly began to tail Luce.

She wanted to learn more about her.

\*\*\*

In the corner of the Hydrangea Garden. I had been training my magic
while waiting for Princess Snow White.

But right now… I just stared up blankly at a girl with rose-gold hair.

“Isaac, aren’t you hungry? I brought some stuff to eat in case you
hadn’t eaten yet. Do you want me to feed you?”

She had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, tilted her head, and smiled
playfully at me.

“Luce…”

***…This girl, how did she get here?***

<span id="0138_140_Mentor_Isaac_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 140: Mentor Isaac (5)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (5) ༻**

“L-lady Miya!!”

In the end… today was no different.

The escort wizard from the Land of Fire Blossoms suddenly saw Priestess
Miya turn into a fox fire and felt her heart sink.

She felt a sense of despair, thinking, ‘Here we go again’.

“Lady Miyaaaa!! Where are youuuu!!”

If anything were to happen to Miya’s well-being, she knew her head would
be detached from her neck.

The escort wizard, terrified, sweated profusely as she tirelessly
searched for Miya.

\* \* \*

Luce and I sat side by side on a small rock I made using \[Rock
Generation\].

The lunchbox Luce brought was packed from a restaurant, so the taste was
guaranteed to be good.

“Isaac, open your mouth right now.”

“Don’t people usually say ‘say aah’ at times like these?”

Her smile was there, but the choice of words made it sound like she was
issuing a command.

Regardless, when Luce offered food with her fork, I quickly accepted and
ate it.

Then she smiled broadly, her cheeks slightly flushed as if she was
pleased.

Apparently, she had recently learned from a novel that feeding someone
was a gesture of endearment.

“Luce.”

“Yes?”

“How did you know about this place?”

“…”

Luce, while picking up a piece of chicken with her fork, suddenly
paused.

After a brief, awkward silence, she moved her adorable lips.

“I happened to “coincidentally” see Isaac coming this way.”

Luce emphasized the word “coincidentally”.

Still, she maintained a gentle smile on her lips.

“Coincidentally?”

“Yes. You know I have good eyesight. I spotted Isaac from afar.”

“…Is that so.”

Luce nodded vigorously, saying “Yes, yes,” in a way that didn’t quite
match her faint smile, leaving almost an afterimage.

***What a lie… it’s so clumsy, all I can do is laugh.***

With \[Psychological Insight\], I could tell that she had been following
me from afar for days because she wanted to see me.

Using \[Clairvoyance\] to constantly monitor from a distance was
bothersome, so I rarely did it, but it seemed Luce was right in its
blind spot.

“We haven’t been spending much time together lately. You have mentoring
duties, and with the remaining time, you need to focus on training, and
then it’s time to sleep…”

“That’s right.”

***So, that’s why she has been stalking me***

To be more precise, it seemed she came all this way wanting to be with
me, mentoring or not. To Luce, being a princess or anything else was of
no interest.

“Even so, you didn’t eat dinner? You know that upsets me, right?”

“I had a piece of bread… Hey, this is delicious, you know?”

“You were hungry, after all. Wait, let me feed you. Open your mouth.”

“Can’t you just tell me to ‘say aah’?”

I realized I couldn’t let Luce leave until we finished eating, so I
decided to explain everything thoroughly to White upon her arrival.

I must have been really hungry. The food Luce brought was delicious,
especially the seasoned chicken, which I loved.

We made some jokes and played around while feeding each other.

“You braided your hair, didn’t you?”

“Does it suit me?”

“Of course. Can I twist it with my finger just once?”

“Only if I can twist Isaac’s hair too. Tousled hair\~.”

We giggled as we playfully twisted each other’s hair with our fingers.

Suddenly, a playful voice that wouldn’t leave my memories came to mind.

*─’Aren’t you a little sad? You didn’t get to marry me.’*

Indeed, Luce was unbearably adorable.

\* \* \*

“Ehehe. It’s perfect, Merlin! This magic tool will surely make me
stronger!”

Snow White exhaled sharply through her nose. Her face had a smile filled
with hope.

Merlin was walking through the Hydrangea Garden with the princess, who
had been tricked by a merchant’s smooth talk.

After being overwhelmed and fainting from Luce Eltania’s immense mana,
White began to burn with enthusiasm, wishing to become like her.

Thus, she impulsively purchased an expensive magic tool and now held it
in her hand.

*─‘Merlin! This is a famous magic tool known to greatly improve mana
mastery! It’s said to significantly enhance mana! It cost two weeks’
worth of meals, but it must be worth it, right?’*

White declared confidently that she would cultivate self-reliance at the
academy and take responsibility for her own life.

In this land, a unique currency named ‘gel’ facilitates the circulation
of a small economy, so the gel in White’s wallet would be her only
available asset…

She did receive a substantial amount of gel as an admission reward, but
the problem was that White’s grades were exceedingly low.

The only means to earn ‘gel’ were through ‘performance evaluations’ and
‘exams’. Since it was during the semester, it was not possible to earn
gel through labor. Naturally, this meant that the gel she could acquire
would be limited for a while.

Overspending was a quick path to ruin. Merlin worried whether White
would be able to make sensible purchases with the remaining gel she had
remaining.

“Senior Isaac will surely praise me for being so commendable, won’t he?
Ehehe\~.”

“Yes… he surely will.”

But Merlin wasn’t brave enough to say anything against that bright
smile, which seemed to make flowers bloom around her. Especially since
it was a purchase for her own development…

Merlin could only nod in response to White’s words.

Eventually, they reached a secluded path, nearly arriving at a corner of
the Hydrangea Garden.

“Ah, there’s Senior Isaac\~. Who is he with… Freeze!”

White suddenly stopped and quickly stretched her arm out to the side to
block Merlin. She had an urgent expression.

Then she pushed Merlin’s back, grunting, and hid behind a nearby tree.

White peered out from behind the tree, glancing toward Isaac.

“Why are you doing this, Princess Whi-?”

Merlin also peered out and, upon seeing Isaac, her eyes widened in
surprise.

She saw a female student with rose-gold hair feeding Isaac.

“L-Luce Eltania…! It’s Senior Luce…!”

White’s voice trembled.

Luce Eltania. The top seat of the second year of the Magic Department?

Hadn’t she mentioned her admiration for Luce? Merlin wondered why White
sounded so terrified.

“Are you talking about the famous Ice Princess’?”

“Yes, yess…!”

“But she’s personally feeding Sir Isaac. Seeing how happy they are, they
might be in a relationship.”

“Is she… Senior Isaac’s girlfriend?”

Isaac was indeed a commendable senior with rapid progress, but Luce
Eltania was a being of a different caliber.

White recalled the intimidating aura Luce had displayed in the previous
class. The memory of her smiling brightly at Isaac was in stark
contrast, giving an unfamiliar feeling.

Meanwhile, Merlin casted a look of skepticism.

Luce was a formidable figure, known for having a legendary familiar and
even thwarting the attacks of the Floating Island.

Moreover, having received elite training at Märchen Academy, she would
have mastered the efficient and systematic handling of her abundant
mana.

She was an exceptional student famous for her cold demeanor towards
others and her overwhelming talent.

***Is her heart uniquely softened towards only Isaac?***

***Did Isaac possess something special?***

Such was the doubt that crossed Merlin’s mind.

“Senior Isaac… must be an incredibly capable man!”

White, filled with admiration. Respect for Isaac seemed to have bloomed
even further in her heart.

“He’s truly my mentor…!”

A sigh escaped Merlin’s lips. How could this Princess’s mind be so pure,
she wondered.

Meanwhile,

‘What’s this?’

The beautiful girl with pearl-black hair, Priestess Miya, was greatly
startled upon seeing Isaac and Luce together.

Suspecting that she would definitely be caught by Luce if accompanied by
her escort wizard, Miya had secretly followed her on her own.

So she had made her way to a corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

But there, she witnessed an unexpected scene.

‘She’s smiling…?’

Luce Eltania.

The Luce Eltania, who seemed cold and unapproachable to everyone as if
she had no blood or tears, whom Miya believed to be a fellow
cold-hearted individual, was showing a pure smile and seemed to be
enjoying herself with just one man.

‘That man…’

Miya remembered seeing the man, whom Luce was looking at so
affectionately, before.

He was the silver-blue-haired senior she encountered in the corner of
the Butterfly Garden on the day of the entrance exam while searching for
the Nameless Hero.

She didn’t know his name. What interest could there be in a man whose
mana seemed so insignificant?

But… why was Luce Eltania, of all people, smiling so happily at that
man? Miya couldn’t understand.

Miya frowned.

Irritation surged within her.

Soon, a student fitting the description of pure white and a knight with
a dark green ponytail approached Isaac and Luce. It was White and
Merlin.

White approached Isaac awkwardly, humming a tune and looking away. It
was then that Isaac and Luce stood up.

“I-I didn’t mean to interrupt, you know…! I need to train too…!”

“…”

Luce glared coldly at White, who was fumbling over her words.

White, sweating profusely and with tears welling up in her eyes due to
fear, sent a pleading look to Merlin for help.

Merlin sighed and stepped forward to assist White.

“Are you two, by any chance, an item?”

Luce shook her head, then blushed slightly and timidly replied, “Just
friends…”

Isaac also responded with a similar answer, smiling awkwardly.

‘This is…?’

Merlin’s eyes sparkled as she grasped the nature of their relationship.

‘Perhaps the stage before becoming a couple…!’

Merlin’s heart softened in an instant as if witnessing a sweet moment of
youth.

To Merlin, who still harbored the heart of a young girl, the
relationship between Isaac and Luce appeared very endearing.

“Merlin…?”

White couldn’t understand why Merlin suddenly had sparkling eyes.

Soon after, Isaac looked at White and smiled sheepishly.

“Sorry about that. I was waiting until you arrived. I didn’t mean to
make you feel awkward.”

“No no no! That’s not it at all!”

“Luce, the meal was great. Thank you. See you later.”

Isaac smiled and patted Luce’s shoulder.

“…Alright.”

Luce replied with a voice tinged with reluctance.

If she tried to stay with Isaac even at the cost of disrupting the
mentoring session, it could have the opposite effect and distance them.
She had learned this the hard way during last semester’s social
gathering.

Still, having achieved her goal of having fed Isaac, Luce decided to
leave, content with how things went.

“I’ll get going. See you later, Isaac.”

“Take care.”

Luce gave Isaac a quick smile and gathered her things.

As she was leaving, she casted a brief glance at White.

“…!”

A shiver ran down White’s spine.

Luce… was glaring at her.

White immediately realized why. She had been receiving one-on-one
training from Isaac, so Senior Luce must have been feeling jealous.

White wanted to assure Senior Luce that there was nothing to worry
about, but she couldn’t find the words.

Luce silently left the corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

A brief, awkward silence followed.

“S-se-senior Isaaaac, s-shall we s-start the t-training…?!”

Feeling as though Luce’s hostility still lingered, White stammered like
a broken clock.

“Are you okay? Is something wrong?”

“No, no… Just feeling a bit stiff. Let’s get on with the training…!”

“Oh, you bought a magic tool. I have one of those too.”

“Ah… Eheheh. Exactly! Seems like I made a good choice!”

As Isaac smiled kindly and changed the topic, White quickly became more
cheerful.

The two chatted happily about the magic tool.

\*\*\*

“I saw it.”

Colorful hydrangeas were in full bloom along the path.

As Luce passed through the Hydrangea Garden, a girl with pearl-black
hair suddenly emerged and spoke to her. It was Priestess Miya.

Luce looked at her with an indifferent expression, then turned her head
forward and hastened her steps, showing no interest.

Miya blurted out words towards the back of Luce as she was leaving.

“I didn’t know Senior Luce could smile like that.”

Luce ignored her.

“You look really beautiful when you smile, Senior. Enough for me to get
entrances, even if for a moment.”

Luce continued to ignore her.

“Why would someone like you only smile for such an unremarkable man?”

Luce stopped in her tracks.

Realizing she had struck a nerve, Miya smirked, teasing Luce.

“Is that senior your type, Senior Luce? Well, his face isn’t too bad.
But you two… don’t seem to be on the same level.”

“…”

“I think you’re smiling at the wrong person. How about smiling for
someone more on your level? You are truly amazing, Senior Luce.”

Luce turned her head back and glared at Miya.

Her eyes, deep like the ocean, held no light within them. That cynical
look gave Miya the chilling sensation of walking on thin ice.

Yes, that was Luce Eltania. Miya gladly accepted the hostility emanating
from Luce.

“You aim to be an exalted Tower Master, don’t you? But honestly, you
can’t achieve that dream alone, can you? It’s not something you can
become just with some money and talent.”

“…”

“But you know, Senior Luce\~ I have wealth, fame, power, everything. I
can grant you everything you desire.”

“…”

Miya, with her hands behind her back and a fox-like grin, slowly
approached Luce.

“Let me reintroduce myself. I am Miya, the Priestess of the Land of the
Fire Blossoms. If you’re going to smile, it’d be better to smile at me
instead of that insect…”

\[Miya, run!!\]

Suddenly, blue and purple magic circles conjured around Luce in multiple
directions.

*Fzzzzzzt───────!!!*

*Whoooosh────────!!!*

The powerful water magic, imbued with the purple lightning of
Thunderbird, shot toward Miya like a cannon, with no place for her to
escape.

Miya’s eyes widened as she instinctively calculated the summoning spell
for the Nine-tailed Fox in her head.

Soon, the Nine-tailed Fox’s mana cloaked her, creating nine red fiery
tails to form a robust protective shield.

However.

*Bzzzt─────!!*

*Boom─────!!*

“Gahh!!”

The purple lightning collided with the flames, causing a mana-induced
explosion, and a massive wave of water swept Miya away.

The upper hand of elemental advantage, the disparity in power.

In every aspect, Luce overwhelmed Miya.

Chapter 141: Mentor Isaac (6)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (6) ༻**

Miya’s body crashed against a tree.

The water magic that violently surged like a tsunami settled onto the
ground, and Miya’s body slid down with it.

Miya threw up water with painful coughs. Her entire body and mouth
stung. Her body refused to move to her will.

The attack had been a fusion of dense water and powerful lightning
magic. Mana mastery of that level was truly in the realm of talent.

*Step. Step.*

Luce walked closer.

Instinctive fear kicked in, and Miya peered up at her, her body
completely drenched like a wet rat.

*Kuack-.*

“Guergh!”

Luce used her foot to press Miya’s shoulder against the tree and looked
down at her with an expression of apathy.

Luce’s face was shadowed by the shade of the tree they stood under; her
oceanic eyes glowed with a frightening bloodlust.

Lightning mana sparked around Luce like a flashing barrier. Behind her
stood the flickering figure of a black grouse, the bird of prey’s eyes
flashing.

It was the mana of the legendary magic beast, Thunderbird Galia.

Moreover, the synchronization of the familiar and Luce was at MAX. Luce
and the Thunderbird’s powers were one.

Whether it was mana mastery, elemental firepower, or her familiar, she
was flawless in every way.

Gazing upon the beautiful figure of an awe-inspiring woman of power.

Miya… felt strong disbelief.

“Senior Luce, but why…?”

Because she couldn’t understand.

She, who had wealth, power, and fame had offered Luce to help achieve
her dreams. It must have been a rare and tempting offer for her.

Even if it hadn’t been, not a single person in this world could rashly
charge at Miya in this manner.

Yes. She, the Priestess, was practically the ruler of the eastern
nation. What she had just done had been no different from initiating an
attack on an entire nation.

Miya was utterly bewildered because of that. She hadn’t expected this to
happen. Her actions were not just a little, but far from the common
sense she knew.

Soon after, Luce’s voice fell upon her.

“I know that you were there, watching us.”

Luce’s eyesight was much sharper than what would normally be considered
reasonable.

It was to the point she would be able to identify a single ant in the
distance if she concentrated.

So she knew just a moment ago that White, Merlin, and Miya had been
watching her and Isaac.

White was fine since she had been expected to come.

But the problem was Miya.

“Who do you think you are…”

“Guahkk!”

Luce put more pressure onto the foot that was pressed on Miya’s
shoulder. Miya cried out in pain.

“…To call Isaac an insect?”

What had come to Luce’s mind was a shred of regret that had come from
her shattered heart.

A person who had become precious to Luce when she had been abandoned by
another precious person.

It was the agonizing memory of when she had lost the Candy House Witch.

In front of the countless soldiers, tears merely streamed down Luce’s
face as she held the Candy House Witch in her arms. The helplessness and
pain of bereavement had strangled her until now.

To that Luce, who had been lost amid her darkened heart, Isaac had
appeared like a ray of light. He had become her precious person.

So the value that Isaac held for Luce was worth more than a fortune. If
someone dared to criticize him, then a pure flame of fury ignited within
Luce.

Luce leaned over and stared down at Miya up close. Her braided locks of
rose-gold hair slid down over her shoulders.

And for a while, the two continued to gaze into one another’s eyes.

Overwhelmed by the frigid eyes that seemed ready to kill her at any
moment, Miya even forgot to breathe.

“Don’t ever, talk to me again.”

Luce whispered to her in a low voice.

Then, Luce withdrew her foot from Miya’s shoulder and turned around,
calmly leaving the scene.

“…”

Miya grasped the shoulder that Luce stomped on. It hurt. At the same
time, the Nine-tailed Fox’s mana was withdrawn and her flame tails
disappeared.

She stared, dazed, at the second-year top seat walking into the
distance.

The rose-gold hair blended into the sunset on the horizon.

“…Tch.”

Miya clicked her tongue.

It was the first time she had been beaten. Her entire body shook.

***This… is humiliation.***

It was an emotion that she had felt for the first time.

Soon, a small flame flickered from her index finger. Miya glimpsed down
at that flame.

\[Miya, do not provoke that child.\]

Immediately after, the Nine-tailed Fox’s voice rang in her ears.

\[Not even I can compete against the Thunderbird. Not to mention that
the Thunderbird’s power has already integrated into that girl’s
strength, so there is not a single thing I can do.\]

“…”

Miya’s attractive crimson-laced eyes narrowed irritatedly.

A sigh came out together with her voice.

“Bullshit.”

It was natural for her to claim what she wanted.

It was natural for her to stand on top.

That had been the natural way of life for Miya.

‘Isaac…’

The silver-blue-haired senior, Isaac. Was he really that precious to
Luce Eltania, to the point that he clouded her rational thinking?

Miya chuckled and supported herself against the tree to stand up, then
began walking in the opposite direction of the path Luce took.

Though her legs were still shaky, she managed to walk after casting
healing magic.

“I want her even more now…”

Humiliation and shame washed over Miya, causing her to shrink. Her
entire body was shivering from the cold.

But these new emotions had instead ignited an even stronger fire within
Miya.

Using the heat from her fire mana, Miya dried off the water from her
body as she walked forward.

Luce Eltania, Isaac.

She continued to repeat those two names in her mind.

Eventually, Miya rejoined with the escort wizard who had been searching
for her.

The escort wizard shook in fear when she found parts of Miya’s school
uniform torn, but Miya shook it off and told her that it was not a big
deal.

She did not want to cause a commotion over something as trivial as this.

…There had been someone who witnessed the entire incident.

A female student who enjoyed taking walks had been passing through the
Hydrangea Garden when she sensed a strong mana and found Luce and Miya.

Her light pink hair was braided down on both sides into a loop. Unlike
other students, she wore a veil and robe.

Her eyes were opened so narrowly that her eyes could not be seen. One
could even believe that her eyes were closed.

The only prominent expression on her face was her noble smile that
contained her interest in what she witnessed.

“Sylon. Do you know who ‘Isaac’ is?”

The Saintess, Bianca Anturaze, asked her escort priest in an elegant
voice.

\*\*\*

After finishing my lesson with White, we parted ways at the entrance of
the Hydrangea Garden.

On the path toward the dorms. A glowing ball of mana similar to that of
a firefly flew towards me and landed on my arm. It was Frost Dragon
Hilde.

\[Master, I am back.\]

‘Hilde, tell me what you said before again.’

I had Frost Dragon Hilde constantly patrol my surroundings. She was
similar to an extra surveillance device in addition to my
\[Clairvoyance\].

Her role was to relay the situation to my head whenever something
happened.

It was natural for me to be extra cautious since not only did Alice
suspect me of being the Black Monster, but the Paladins were also put
into action.

Just a moment ago, Hilde had reported what had happened around me.

But because I did not have a chance to respond then, I decided to take a
moment to sort the events once more.

‘So the Priestess had been spying on me and got into a fight with Luce…
and the Saintess witnessed that happen?’

\[Correct.\]

I was the reason why Luce and Miya fought. Miya had insulted me to spur
Luce, and that triggered Luce’s anger.

It looked like Miya planned to keep quiet about this incident. She
likely wants to make Luce hers like she had originally planned.

Even if I hadn’t been the reason, it was inevitable for those two to
have conflict. Miya shouldn’t do anything over threatening to make Luce
hers.

Anyhow, Miya had realized that I was Luce’s weakness.

This had also been revealed to Saintess Bianca, who coincidentally
happened to witness the two female students fighting,

It was difficult to predict what variables would emerge from this
situation. I did at least expect that she would not do anything rash to
me now that she knew harming me was akin to suicide if Luce found out,
but…

Well, it was inevitable for me to come into contact with Miya anyway.
I’d just think of it as the schedule having been pulled forward a bit.

Actually, I may have become safer now that Miya believed that I was
under Luce’s protection.

‘The problem is the Saintess.’

Saintess Bianca Anturaze.

As expected from the three main characters of the Golden Generation, she
was quite beautiful, a female student with light pink hair that seemed
quite noble. She had narrow eyes, but she wasn’t a hidden villain.

She was a side character in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

And because I didn’t like her personality, I didn’t plan to associate
with her. But it looked like Bianca had input the name ‘Isaac’ into her
head.

I didn’t know what to do, because this girl’s actions were even harder
to predict than the Paladins.

…It wasn’t like I had a choice. I now needed to create my plan even more
systematically while taking Bianca into consideration.

I now needed to prepare to fight scenario demons like the Abyssal Sea
Monster and the Necromancer King.

The first enemy of Semester 1 Year 2, the Abyssal Sea Monster, was going
to make its appearance soon. It was going to be during the next joint
practical evaluation.

I had a lot to think about.

***I’ll sort my thoughts out before I go to bed after finishing today’s
training…***

“…?”

Just as I was passing through an empty path, I suddenly felt mana
powerful enough to make a shiver run down my spine.

*Whooooosh—-.*

A soft light green wind wrapped around me.

When I whipped my head up in surprise, I found a female student’s face
right in front of me.

The girl was surrounded by the wind. Her light green twin tails and
wizard’s cape fluttered in the wind.

With a bright smile, she wrapped her arms around my shoulder and then
landed on the ground in my embrace.

After locking me in with her arms so that I couldn’t escape.

*Chu.*

She cutely pecked my cheek. The pleasant feeling left a lingering
sensation on my cheek.

With a flushed face, she had a lovely smile as she gazed at me up close.

“It’s been a while, Sir Isaac! Did you miss me?”

One of my favorite characters, Kaya Astrea.

Or Dark Kaya, to be exact.

“I know I missed you a lot\~.”

“Kaya…?”

Kaya laughed innocently and rubbed her cheek against my face. All sorts
of squishy things such as her cheek or chest came into contact with me,
I didn’t know what to do.

I couldn’t escape from her reach because her arms were wrapped around
me, and I was going crazy from her warm breath touching my skin. I let
my guard down because it had been a long time since I had seen her.

Anyway, it looks like she also made some changes after becoming a second
year, just as Luce had braided her hair.

Her difference was that the black hair tie she used changed to a red one
that was just like her eye color. It suited her hair color as well. Her
hair also seemed a bit shorter as well.

“Yeah, it’s nice to see you. Have you been well?”

“Yes, thanks to Sir Isaac. Sigh. You’ve become so manly after becoming a
second year\~.”

Still close to me, Kaya tilted her head from side to side while talking
to me in a cute voice.

I opened my eyes partially and fixed my glasses, then glared at her.

“More importantly, haven’t you been avoiding me these days?”

With a quiet, “Ahh…” Kaya quietly turned her eyes away from me.

I really liked Kaya. So I wanted to go say hello and have the occasional
conversation with her, but she kept on running away from me.

Whenever I checked on her with \[Psychological Insight\], it looked like
she wanted to say something to me, but she was having a hard time with
it.

I didn’t think she needed to hide it though.

“There’s something that I didn’t want to talk about… I’m sorry about
that.”

Kaya smiled awkwardly.

Her mother had caught onto the feelings that she had for me.

So she had promised to bring the person she liked to the Astrea Manor
but was debating about how to suggest to me the promise that she had
made on her own terms.

It looked like today was the day that she mustered up the courage, even
using Dark Kaya, for it.

This was convenient. I had been planning to force a strategy meeting if
I needed to so that we could deal with the Abyssal Sea Monster with
ease.

I’d already talked about it with Dorothy, and it had been about time to
talk with Kaya as well.

“I had something to talk about with you too. I was going to talk with
you sometime soon.”

“Oh, what is it?”

“You talk first. Why did you avoid me?”

“Ah…”

Kaya quietly stared at me.

Then burst out in laughter as if she couldn’t hold it in anymore, and
wrapped her arms around my waist, burying herself into my chest.

With Kaya rubbing her face against my chest, her scent wafted up and
tickled my nose.

“Can we stay like this a little longer and talk later? I just can’t help
liking Sir Isaac so much…”

***…She’s way too cute.***

<span id="0140_142_Mentor_Isaac_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 142: Mentor Isaac (7)
=============================

**༺ Mentor Isaac (7) ༻**

“It’s been a long time since I’ve been here. I remember being grandly
rejected by Sir Isaac here.”

“It wasn’t a rejection…”

“Hehe, just kidding\~.”

When the twilight slowly settled in.

Kaya and I visited Norhan Lake, located in Josena Forest near the gates
of Märchen Academy, for the first time in a while.

The lake, with its natural mana flowing gorgeously, was emitting its
clear and vivid colors as always.

We could have done the discussion in a hideout not so far from here, but
we decided it would be better to come to a place filled with memories.

Kaya and I sat at the tree stump and admired the beautiful lake. We
could hear the sound of water flowing and the buzzing of insects.

It atmosphere here was still amazing.

“So, what’s the thing you have problems saying?”

“Ah, yes. That is…”

Kaya awkwardly smiled and twirled her hair with her fingers.

“…The more I think about it, the more I feel it’s not the right time to
say it. May I speak after you have achieved your goal?”

Seeing my face, Kaya seemed to waver in her resolve and changed the
subject.

Indeed, it made sense. What Kaya wanted to suggest to me was technically
a family meeting, but since even the steps before that hadn’t been
properly taken care of, it would be too soon.

I decided to pretend like I didn’t know and I reacted accordingly.

“Why?”

“I feel it’s too premature to speak now. I’m sorry, but… if someday you
could set down your heavy burden, and if I’m seen as a woman by you, Sir
Isaac… would it be okay to tell you then?”

***That’s a lot of hints.***

I took it as Kaya just laying the groundwork for something more. I’d act
surprised when she got to the main point later.

I sighed lightly, feigning disappointment with a kind smile as I patted
Kaya’s head.

“It’s okay if it’s hard to say. Speak when you feel like it.”

“…As expected, Sir Isaac, you are very understanding. It would have been
too frustrating for me to bear it.”

***Because I already know what you want to say.***

I wasn’t a particularly forgiving or generous person. If I hadn’t known,
I would have pressed the issue out of frustration.

As soon as I tried to take my hand off of Kaya’s head, she quickly
caught it and rubbed it against her cheek. She closed her eyes,
seemingly enjoying the touch of my hand.

“One thing I can confidently say is that…”

Kaya let out a suggestive smile.

“I am always ready to be Sir Isaac’s woman. This body, my heart, all of
me belongs to Sir Isaac…”

She was going along with the mood, seemingly intent on seducing me
again. She did that whenever she got a chance.

***Did she come up with this cheesy line during the holidays?***

From my past readings of her psychology, she was determined to seduce me
relentlessly until my journey at Märchen Academy was finished.

I could almost see Kaya’s original personality screaming in agony right
about now. She must be ignoring that desperate scream.

“…Sorry, but as I’ve said before, I’m not in a position to be in a
relationship yet.”

“Of course, I know\~. But once Sir Isaac’s intentions are realized, then
it will be time for me and Sir Isaac’s rendezvous, right? I bet you
can’t even begin to imagine how much I’m looking forward to that
moment.”

Kaya, with a beaming smile, took my hand that had been rubbing her cheek
and placed it on her chest, as if to let me feel her heartbeat.

“I like you, Sir Isaac. It will always be so… please never forget that.”

“…”

Being human, hearing such words made my face flush.

I tried to maintain my facial expression, but I too was reminded of my
own manhood.

“…How could I forget that?”

My lips quivered in response to Kaya’s seductive provocation, seemingly
because my affection for her had reached its limit.

“By the way, what was it that you wanted to say, Sir Isaac?”

“It’s about a strategy meeting.”

“…Is it about the demons?”

Kaya guessed the meaning of my answer and her expression turned serious.

I nodded my head.

*Squish.*

Suddenly, Kaya hugged my arm and rested her cheek on my shoulder. I
could feel the softness of her chest against my arm.

Her expression was still serious, which didn’t match the bold behavior
typical of lovers.

“Please explain.”

“…What are you doing?”

“It’s a bit chilly, don’t you think? If we’re going to have a strategy
meeting, isn’t it better to stay like this? Humans are social animals
and this is social behavior.”

“Is that so…”

***How shameless…***

I was dumbfounded, but since it wasn’t an unpleasant feeling, I let it
pass.

I shared the information about The Abyssal Sea Monster’s appearance with
Kaya during the joint practical evaluation and discussed with her how to
deal with it safely.

And when we finished talking and were about to part.

Kaya, expressing sadness, kissed my cheek several times and asked to
stay a bit longer, hugging me tightly for a while.

Only after I barely managed to pull away was I able to send her back to
the dorm.

***…It was a healing experience.***

The chirping of sparrows announced the morning.

The morning sunlight pierced through the silk curtains, brightening the
dorm for top-ranked students, Charles Hall.

On the bed, Kaya Astrea slowly opened her eyes. Her jade-colored irises
captured the familiar ceiling in her view.

She laid there impassively for a while…

Suddenly, the memories of the previous day struck Kaya like an arrow.

“Cough!”

Kaya coughed up blood and then trembled violently.

“Kill… me…”

The more she dwelled on what she had said to Isaac, and her attempts to
seduce him…

Kaya clutched at her chest in agony and writhed in her bed.

*─‘I am always ready to be Sir Isaac’s woman. This body, my heart, all
of me belongs to SIr. Isaac…’*

“Ughhh…!”

*─‘I like you, Sir Isaac. It will always be so… please never forget
that.’*

“Stop… Stop it…!”

*─‘It’s a bit chilly, don’t you think? If we’re going to have a strategy
meeting, isn’t it better to stay like this? Humans are social animals
and this is social behavior.’*

“Gaaah…!”

*Bang!*

The door swung open and Mary, the Astrea family’s personal maid with
purple hair, hurried in.

“Miss Kaya! What’s the matter?! Huh!”

“Mary… please… take away my breath… please…!”

“Lady Kaya?!”

Kaya felt like dying of shame.

\*\*\*

In a shabby warehouse adorned with triangular gables, Abel Carnedas
listened intently.

The abandoned warehouse was located somewhere in Josena Forest, near the
main gate of Märchen Academy.

In front of him, kneeling on one knee, was a small ant made of
turquoise-colored natural mana.

Its voice was very small, fitting its size. Moreover, being a magic
beast that had not yet reached maturity, its linguistic ability was not
even comprehensible.

But Abel understood the words of the magic ant. He could perceive its
emotions and thoughts.

“Being able to use 1-star magic already is amazing! According to my
logical analysis, you have the potential to become a fully-fledged rock
element magic beast capable of using 3-star rock magic within ten
years.”

The ant raised its forelegs and its eyes sparkled. It was a tiny
gesture, smaller than a segment of a finger.

Abel, a boy with mischievous gray-blue hair, smiled brightly.

“Of course, I know. I have a deep understanding of magic beast ecology.
What’s that, you ask? It’s a field of study about creatures like you.
So, you can completely trust what I say… Ah, what time is it?”

He had lost track of time while talking with the magic ant.

Abel took out a pocket watch from inside his clothing to check the time.
The mysterious face of the watch, shimmering with a golden hue, had a
strangely shaped hour hand ticking away.

“…My goodness.”

Could his eyes be deceiving him? Abel rubbed his eyes and looked at the
pocket watch again, starting to sweat profusely.

“Are you able to move now?!”

The ant nodded.

“It’s a shame we can’t talk more! I have somewhere I need to be…!”

Abel hurriedly slung the bag he had placed beside him over his shoulder.

“Then, let’s meet again next time!”

With that, Abel dashed out of the abandoned warehouse.

Reflecting on the situation,

Abel Carnedas had stopped by Josena Forest early in the morning to
converse with small magic beasts formed from natural mana.

He had heard the crying of the ant in the abandoned warehouse.

So he went inside and, after casting a healing spell to accelerate the
natural recovery of the injured ant, had a pleasant conversation with
it.

It couldn’t be helped. To him, young magic beasts were very endearing.

Abel glanced at his pocket watch and ran down the verdant path.

“Ah, I’m going to be late…!”

In Märchen Academy, where only the most talented students gathered, he
could not bear the disgrace of being the first freshman to be late,
especially being from the Carnedas family.

Abel ran as if his life depended on it.

\*\*\*

“Merlin! This is the highest quality parchment for practicing magic
circles! The pen marks show up so well on it that it’s much more
effective for learning than other parchments! It cost about 500 gels,
but it’s worth it, right?”

“Merlin! This is a magical herb said to help increase mana! If you brew
and drink this, the amount of mana you can wield will grow rapidly! It
costs the equivalent of three weeks worth of meals, but it’s worth it,
right?”

“Merlin! This is…”

“Merlin!”

Lately, Merlin had developed a problem.

***White’s spending habits… have become too excessive…!***

The joint practical evaluation was coming up soon. White had been
fervently training in preparation for the exam.

Whenever possible, White was swayed by merchants’ sweet talk and ended
up buying anything and everything claimed to help with training.

“With this much, I’m all set\~. I’ll easily pass the next exam. Senior
Isaac will be so surprised when he sees how much stronger I’ve suddenly
become! Heehee.”

It was just a few days ago that White had said those words. She was
looking forward to a future brimming with bright light and hope.

But today, White’s expression was tinged with worry.

Noon. In front of Orphin Hall, the Magic Department lecture hall, on a
bench.

White had been repeatedly making remarks about the nice weather in every
conversation since earlier, saying things like, ‘The weather is nice,’
‘The weather is good,’ etc. Merlin knew that White tended to talk about
the weather when she had a secret she wanted to hide.

Merlin wasn’t sure whether it was appropriate to ask such a question to
White, who had resolved to become more independent.

Merlin felt that she had to ask.

“Princess White, how much gel do you have left…?”

“What?! gel? Oh, I have plenty left!”

White responded dramatically.

Her eyes betrayed her turmoil.

“Ah, I still have, enough, enough to last until the next exam!”

The quake in her eyes gradually spread throughout her body.

Merlin instantly realized that it was a lie born out of embarrassment.

Befitting her status as a Princess, the concept of ‘rational spending’
had not yet taken root for White.

It seemed that her financial situation was… not very good.

Merlin kept quiet, not wanting to tarnish White’s declaration of
self-reliance and her dignity.

After all, living within one’s means according to their current income
level was an important task for fostering independence.

Merlin decided to just watch and see if White could navigate through her
current problem.

\* \* \*

As mentioned before, to obtain a specific item from The Abyssal Sea
monster, the demon from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ Act 7, there was a
hidden condition.

If that condition was met, one could obtain a magic weapon called ‘Ring
of the Abyssal Queen’.

I planned to give that ring to Luce.

***The only problem is that the ring had to be worn on the ring finger
of the left hand to take effect…***

“How should I give it to her…”

The sky was darkly stained at night. I was jogging down the street lit
by glowing stones in the street lamps, lost in thought.

For now, one task has been accomplished.

A few days earlier, I had placed a cube filled with corrupted dust,
which granted \[Domain Expansion\], on Ian’s usual path.

As he passed by, I lightly burst it with a pre-prepared spell.

At that moment, the corrupted dust seeped into Ian. He was flustered and
confused.

Thus, he became capable of deploying a light element domain. It was a
crude method, but also fitting.

However, I was still troubled about how to give the ring to Luce.

Luce was sharp. A clumsy lie would be worse than not saying anything.

The joint practical evaluation day, the appearance of The Abyssal Sea
Monster was coming soon. I needed to resolve this problem quickly…

“…Hm?”

Suddenly, I noticed a girl in a school uniform, standing dazed and
drooling in front of a small unmanned shop run by magic tools. She was a
student whom the term ‘pure white’ seemed naturally fitting.

Her gaze was fixed on the display case.

I stopped and tilted my head, examining her face closely.

“…”

Indeed, it was Snow White.

***What’s she doing here? And where’s Merlin?***

“White?”

“Ah, Senior Isaac?!”

As I approached and spoke to her, White was startled and looked at me.

She hurriedly wiped the drool from her mouth, making a flustered sound.

“What were you doing?”

“Oh, nothing…?”

White awkwardly smiled and waved her arms vehemently.

I looked at the unmanned store’s display case. There were simple food
items like bread inside.

It was a device similar to the unmanned stores used in last semester’s
hunting evaluation, essentially a vending machine that dispensed food in
exchange for gels. Its appearance was quite crude.

Soon after,

*Gurgle.*

“Ah…”

A loud hunger alarm sounded from White’s stomach.

Tears welled up in White’s eyes as she continued to smile awkwardly.

Overwhelmed with unbearable sadness, she expressed her true feelings in
a tearful voice.

“Senior Isaac… I’m hungry… Sob…”

“…”

***…It seems like she has been through a lot.***

<span id="0141_143_Mentor_Isaac_-_Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 143: Mentor Isaac - Interlude
=====================================

**༺ Mentor Isaac – Interlude ༻**

I read White’s psychology.

‘…You don’t have gel.’

I immediately grasped her situation.

White had spent all of the gel she had and was starving.

Her oath to become more independent and take responsibility for herself
likely caused her to push herself too far.

One may ask where she could use so much gel, and the answer would be…
her training equipment. She has been boasting to me about her new tools,
after all.

***I know she meant well… But this was a little too much.***

“I never knew bread tasted this good…”

Inside a dark garden. White and I sat side by side on a bench lit by a
street lamp.

She was nibbling on her bread with tears of joy in her eyes. I felt a
bit of pity for her.

“Did they say they’ll stay over there?”

I turned to look at a tree out of reach from the street lamp’s light.

Merlin Astrea’s golden eyes glowed.

“She said that she would keep her distance so she does not become
weak-hearted. She told me to overcome my problems on my own…”

So, she had intentionally widened the distance she stood from White to
control herself.

I could understand that. It would be indeed difficult for her to hold
back from helping when White was suffering from an empty stomach.

Merlin likely wanted to respect White’s resolve and determination.

For reference, I knew Merlin was over there because she had suddenly
bursted out of nowhere just as White was about to eat the bread and
stole a bite before leaving again.

She had done that to see if the bread had been poisoned.

Though I understood the situation, seeing her hop in to take a bite and
leave without elaborating had still been a little perplexing.

“…Senior Isaac always seems to be training.”

I was holding a magic tool in my right hand to continue circulating my
mana. It was a simple training method I used whenever I was jogging or
had some leftover time.

White took another mouthful of her bread. Her cheeks puffed up like a
hamster storing its food in its mouth.

“*Nomnom*… Is there any reason why you work so hard?”

“It’s nice to have good grades, and you’re guaranteed to become
something in the future. There’s even a sense of accomplishment you get
from it. What about you?”

“Ah. I-it’s similar to me too…! Sense of improvement, yeah, for the
sense of improvement!”

“Is that so?”

White’s objective for becoming stronger was to become friends with the
Priestess and Saintess. It seemed like she was embarrassed to say that
as her goal.

“Then why were you starving? There are more than a handful of people
willing to give you gel if asked.”

An entire line of students existed who wished to become close to White.
She was a princess after all.

It wasn’t like she didn’t know that.

“That’s… something I don’t want to do.”

“Why?”

“Because I feel like I will need to repay them. I don’t really like
those sorts of things. Not just that, but people normally do that to use
me to their advantage. Feeling the obligation to repay people like that…
is terrible.”

Ah, right.

White didn’t like being indebted to others.

Moreover, she had difficulty trusting those who were kind to her and
considered it uncomfortable when they did so. Rather, she thought of
them as embezzlers.

There was a valid reason for such trust issues to have rooted inside
White’s mind.

‘She was almost assassinated after all.’

White had personally experienced what it was like to have people be kind
to her one moment, only to try and assassinate her the next.

Moreover, the person behind that request had been her mother, so the
shock a child like her would have felt was unfathomable.

It was natural for her to have trauma.

…But even then.

“But I don’t think starving is a good idea.”

“It’s the result of my wrong decisions. I must handle it myself…”

What she said was indeed quite mature.

“Senior Isaac. I owe you. I am indebted to Senior Isaac now.”

White spoke while looking down at her bread.

Debt, she said. White likely had an easier time accepting it that way.

“*Nomnom*… I’ll definitely repay this debt one day.”

“…I’ll be looking for interest, too.”

“Yes, of course!”

White was a character essential for me to reach a happy ending.

It wouldn’t hurt me to have a favor over her. This would actually be
better for White as well.

“Speaking of debt, Senior Isaac.”

“Yeah?”

“Can you lend me a guarantee… I mean gel?”

I heard a scary word come out of her mouth, but I pretended I didn’t
hear it.

White had low mana and even lower grades. If she received a loan from
the academy’s bank, the interest would snowball into a size that she
couldn’t handle.

It had been fine for me since I had a plan, but not her.

She didn’t even have enough money to sustain herself until the next
exam, so she seemed to have decided to borrow gel from me.

“…Alright. Train harder so you can get more gel. Remember that you’ll
have to take responsibility if you can’t repay me.”

White’s expression brightened once her path to survival had been
guaranteed.

“T-thank you, Senior Isaac…! I will make sure to take responsibility and
repay you!”

I didn’t worry about White, who had one strong sense of responsibility,
running away with my money.

Her dislike for debt didn’t come without reason. With her, she would do
anything to repay her debts.

“But won’t you be the first princess to be indebted to a commoner?”

“Then this could be considered an important moment in Zelver’s history!”

In the middle of that humiliating moment, White smiled as if it were a
light joke to her.

Seeming to have lightened her mental load, she stared straight ahead
with a much more relaxed expression.

She stopped chewing on her bread. It looked like she had something she
wanted to say.

“Hey, Senior Isaac.”

“Yeah.”

“I like that Senior Isaac treats me comfortably. It makes me comfortable
as well.”

“It does?”

“But you are firm when you must be and strict during training. A little
like a real teacher.”

“I think that’s a bit too far. I’m just a mentor.”

“I haven’t seen anyone like Senior Isaac before, though. At first
glance, Senior Isaac seemed soft-hearted, but you weren’t…. Anyway,
that’s just my impression.

Even as the person with the highest status in the academy, Snow White
did not treat social status as something important.

She took advantage of the academy’s culture of easing the social status
between students as a way for her to treat others comfortably.

One could see that from the way she treats me, a commoner.

Just like her exterior, which could be best described as pure white, she
seemed like a white canvas that hadn’t been stained by the colors of
society. That was what caused me to feel affection for this child.

With a kind smile, I extended my hand to her.

“…Let’s do well on that next exam, White.”

“Yes sir, Senior Isaac, sir.”

White smiled widely as she slapped my hand.

*Clap.*

The sound echoed into the night air.

\* \* \*

Under the night sky. On the path lit by street lamps.

A female student with short white hair and a black rabbit ear ribbon,
Amy Holloway, was returning to the dorms with Ian Fairytale after
training. Both were in training clothes, drenched in sweat.

Suddenly, Amy noticed a silver-blue-haired male student, Isaac, and the
Pure White Princess, Snow White, chatting on a bench in the garden.

Amy halted on the spot.

“What is it, Amy?”

The black-haired male student, Ian, also stopped with her. Amy brought
her index finger to her lips and went ‘shh’ to quiet him.

Isaac. She heard that he had become Princess Snow White’s mentor. It was
a hot issue among the students since it was difficult to imagine a
situation outside of Märchen Academy where a commoner mentored a
princess.

So, there was no reason to be suspicious that the two were together.

Amy used the Holloway Family’s bloodline ability, \[Heart Color
Discernment\], to check the color of Isaac’s heart.

It had been something she had constantly been doing since the start of
the first semester of her second year whenever she saw Isaac.

She wanted to memorize every part of that color.

And she wanted confirmation of whether Isaac was the Nameless Hero or
not.

“…That color.”

“What?”

Blue and orange.

No matter how many times she checked, the color of Isaac’s heart
reminded her of the Nameless Hero, which she briefly caught a glimpse
of.

The problem was that she did not get a proper look at the color of the
Nameless Hero’s heart. It was like trying to recall the color of an
arrow flying by.

.

So she wished to see him just one more time.

When she thought of this subject, Amy always arrived at the same
question.

***What will she do if Isaac actually is the Nameless Hero?***

‘I’ll need to question him.’

Whether it was for the Holloway Family or herself.

What she wanted was a happy future together with Ian Fairytale. Märchen
Academy was a stepping stone for her to achieve that dream.

But last year, demons had constantly visited Märchen Academy.

On multiple occasions, the Nameless Hero defeated those demons and
protected Ian. Moreover, he had even protected herself at the Astrea
Duchy.

To repay that favor and to support the archwizard.

Amy wanted to discover the identity of the Nameless Hero.

“…?”

So, as she gazed at Isaac for such reasons, Amy had unintentionally
taken a glimpse at the colors of Princess Snow White’s heart as well.

“Wait, what’s that?”

“Amy?”

Amy felt a chill run down her spine and frowned.

“…It’s nothing, let’s go\~.”

Amy patted Ian’s back and resumed walking.

Ian seemed confused as he followed behind.

When Amy was young, she promised only to use \[Hear Color Discernment\]
when necessary.

Because it caused her view of that person to become biased. She didn’t
recall a single time where that ended well.

So Amy decided that she hadn’t seen the color of the Princess’s heart.

She had decided that she was merely the kind-hearted Princess Snow
White.

While walking down the path lit with street lamps, Ian asked Amy in an
anxious voice,

“I’m asking this just in case, but you aren’t interested in Isaac or
anything, right?”

In which Amy responded with blushed cheeks,

“Why, are you jealous?”

\*\*\*

\[Meooow. This is Alice’s message.\]

Alice’s Labyrinth; a space consisting of black and red checkered
patterns.

On top of a staircase was the queen’s extravagant throne, where a plump
purple cat in a suit sat. It was Phantom Cat Cheshire.

Standing on either side of the throne were a black rabbit and a white
rabbit in suits, who were fanning the Phantom Cat with red fans.

The four paladins stood in line before the Phantom Cat to listen to
Alice’s message.

\[A demon from the deep oceans will appear during the joint practical
evaluation. The exact location and time of the appearance are unknown.\]

The suit that Phantom Cat Cheshire was wearing seemed on the verge of
bursting due to the rotundness of its body.

\[The Black Monster will come to eliminate the demon. But before that,
the Black Monster may also participate in the evaluation. He is, after
all, hiding his identity and power for some reason. Anyhow, your
objective is to thwart the Black Monster’s plans! It would be even
better if you guys could reveal the Black Monster’s identity!\]

When the Phantom Cat raised its paws while shouting, the shirt button
near its stomach popped off and exposed its furry stomach.

\[Do your best to help the demons defeat the Child of Light and destroy
this world! Meoow!\]

The male student, Spade, clicked his tongue in disapproval.

The female student, Heart, blushed and smiled.

The male student, Clover, nodded with a fake smile that suited his kind
impression.

The female student, Diamond, remained unresponsive.

\[Ah, right, and one more message from Alice.\]

The Phantom Cat delivered the word calmly, resting its chin on its hand.

\[Do not die. You are all Alice’s valued subordinates, after all\~.\]

Heavy tension fell upon the room. The four Paladins blinked slowly.

Their opponent was a mysterious archwizard they could not defeat, even
with the four of them combined.

They could use 9-star magic, and singlehandedly defeated the Floating
Island.

But each Paladin had their resolve to accomplish the queen’s will, no
matter how powerful the enemy.

They folded their left arm behind their waist, placed their right hand
over their chest, and bowed forward slightly.

Then, they all chanted simultaneously.

***Everything as per the Queen’s will.***

\*\*\*

Soon after.

The joint practical evaluation had begun.

<span id="0142_144_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 144: Joint Practical Evaluation (1)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (1) ༻**

During the joint practical evaluation.

“Aaaaah!”

*Swoosh──!*

A sharp water blade cleaved through the demonic illusion.

It was the moment when Princess Snow White let out a scream upon
witnessing the grotesque form of the demonic illusion that had
unexpectedly burst forth.

The demonic illusion vanished into dust.

Abel Carnedas, a male student with grayish-blue hair and a mischievous
expression, glanced at White with a troubled expression.

“Princess White, are you alright?”

“Princess, the demonic illusion was defeated by Sleazo, so please be
reassured.”

“‘Sleazo’? Choose your words carefully, you’re in front of the
princess…”

In front of Abel and Roanna, a girl with light green hair, White cleared
her throat with a ‘hmm-hmm’ and calmed her startled heart.

“I’ve made a pitiful display…”

White had a defeated smile with tears brimming in her eyes.

Abel, after dispelling the water mana from his sword, sheathed it and
gave Roanna an awkward smile.

Despite her friend’s smile, Roanna showed only a stoic expression in
response. To Abel, she was a friend who was level-headed in every
situation.

“Princess, over here.”

“Ah.”

In the dim corridor, only the lamp held by Roanna cast a soft light
around.

She illuminated the ground with her lamp.

“It seems someone was ambushed here. We should have noticed it sooner. I
was not careful enough. I apologize, Princess.”

On the ground, there was a long red mark that resembled a scratch,
leaving a trace of mana. As explained earlier, it was the ‘Scar of
Elimination’.

In the event a student was eliminated for whatever reason, the exam
proctor marked the spot preceding the location where the element causing
the elimination occurred.

“No, no! I’m the one who’s sorry! Let’s go.”

White and her team members quickly crossed the dark corridor.

*About an hour earlier.*

\[Let’s begin the joint practical evaluation.\]

The huge isolated island was entirely the property of Märchen Academy.

Underneath, there was a vast underground facility.

A maze-like facility that had spread out like the legs of an octopus,
named ‘Octovus Hall’.

It was a former emergency shelter that was designed for training
purposes.

The facility was always filled with the mana of Headmistress Elena
Woodline, so anyone who entered Octovus Hall would have their location
detected.

But today, being the day of the exam, her mana had been withdrawn.

Octovus Hall, Entrance No. 13.

The walls, filled with glowing lamps, brightly illuminated the narrow
corridor.

In the air heavy with moisture and a quietly hovering tension…

…Four students listened to the message delivered by a circular magical
device, fluttering like a hummingbird, the messenger.

Two first-year students from the Magic Department: Princess Snow White
von Kairos Elfieto, and Shera Hectorica.

Two first-year students from the Knight Department: Abel Carnedas, and
Roanna Shelton.

The team was formed by the academy, taking into account both a drawing
lot and academic performance.

“Uh…”

Snow White bit her lip, trying hard to calm her trembling heart.

It was an opportunity to demonstrate the results of her rigorous
training under Isaac since she had enrolled in this academy. She
couldn’t help but feel nervous the more effort she had put in.

White took a deep breath to steady her rampant emotions, reaffirming her
resolve to avoid being in the lowest ranks in this exam.

\[The test format is simple. It ends when you reach the destination.\]

The kind voice of a middle-aged female professor flowed from the
messenger. She was a professor for the second year, Class D, of the
Magic Department.

\[This is our underground base, Octovus Hall. The paths are designed
like a maze, but the compasses we’ve provided will guide you to the
destination. The faster you reach it, the more points you will earn, so
please hurry\~.\]

Abel Carnedas, the boy with grayish-blue hair, looked at the compass in
his hand. The compass pointed in only one direction.

\[And if you are eliminated midway, your score will be based on how
close and how quickly you move towards the destination.\]

In any case, it meant the faster they moved, the better. Anyway…

“Eliminated midway?”

White tilted her head in confusion.

\[Oh, what’s this about being eliminated midway? This place is prepared
with all sorts of demonic illusions and labyrinth traps. If you can’t
overcome them with your knowledge and wisdom, you’ll be eliminated.
Also, all students except for your team are your enemies. If you
incapacitate another student, rendering them unable to fight, that
student is eliminated. You will receive bonus points proportional to
that student’s grade and class. Of course, the most significant and
crucial part of your score is how close you get to the destination, so
please keep that in mind!\]

Of course. Since it was called a ‘joint practical evaluation’, combat
was inevitable.

\[But remember, intentionally blocking one’s path is considered cheating
and will lead to immediate disqualification!\]

It was an obvious rule. If a high-ranking student were to create a
magical barrier to block the path of others, it would leave them with no
recourse.

\[And! As you go along the path, you might see parts where red mana
flows – that’s what we call the ‘Scar of Elimination’. If a student
ahead of you was eliminated for whatever reason, a Scar of Elimination
will be marked at the location before they encountered the eliminating
element. Paying close attention to these can significantly increase your
survival chances.\]

In essence, the faster you move towards the destination, the more points
you can earn, but the risk of elimination increases. Moving slowly
increased one’s chances of survival as one would likely encounter more
‘Scars of Elimination’, but it would be difficult to expect a high
score.

\[And, even if a team member is eliminated, you are allowed to continue.
But unnecessarily sacrificing a team member will greatly reduce or even
nullify your teamwork score, so be cautious. Even if you incapacitate
another student, the loss in points won’t change regardless of your
team’s remaining members, so avoid reckless actions.\]

\[And, please pay close attention to this. Exam proctors will be
stationed in key areas. If a particularly dangerous incident occurs in
the middle of the exam, focus on escaping first and then report the
situation to us via the bracelet. The exam proctors will protect you.\]

The mention of danger likely implied the potential appearance of demons.

Suddenly, White recalled the Märchen Academy’s entrance examination
announcement. It stated that ‘Under the auspices of the Elfieto Royal
Family and the Lord Manhalla, no matter what dangers may arise, we will
ensure the protection of our students and guarantee their educational
opportunities.’

White looked down at her left wrist, where the bracelet for the exam was
fastened.

It was evident that the academy had taken various measures to ensure not
only the educational curriculum of Märchen Academy but also the safety
of its students.

As White gulped nervously, wondering if it was about to begin,

\[Lastly, in this exam, there are ‘Predators’.\]

“Predators?”

The name itself already sounded ominous.

\[The Predators are composed of your seniors, either from class A or
those with equivalent skill. In case you manage to incapacitate a
Predator, you can earn a massive amount of bonus points! Whether you
choose to be prey, flee from them, or become hunters capturing them, is
up to you.\]

The purpose of having Predators in the exam was clear.

The exam had the feel of being modeled after maze exploration.

How they dealt with dangerous elements like the Predators was
undoubtedly a crucial criterion for their grades.

\[Well then.\]

The messenger flew to a corner, clearing the path.

A dark corridor unfolded before White, Shera, Abel, and Roanna.

\[We wish you the best of luck.\]

The messenger’s voice cut off abruptly.

And so, the joint practical evaluation began.

“Well, then…”

“Imma go off by myself\~.”

“…What?”

As Abel Carnedas started to speak, a girl with bright red hair raised
her arm lightly and declared her withdrawal with a smiling face. It was
Shera Hectorica.

Bright red short hair, partially braided towards the back. She wore red
earrings and a gold hairpin, all in the shape of hearts.

She was petite, with red eyes that glinted like a gold-tinted sunset
sky, looking quite young and cute, almost making one doubt if she was
really a classmate.

“You guys seem boring.”

Her manner of speaking was perfectly childish, lacking any decorum.

White, Abel, and Roanna couldn’t hide their astonishment.

“It seems like I’m the most skilled here. It’s obvious that I’d have to
lead you all\~. That’s no fun!”

“Great joke. Except it’s not funny.”

Abel scratched his cheekbone area with an awkward smile.

He hadn’t expected a psycho to show such brazen behavior in front of
Princess Snow White.

“Um, excuse me! You said your name was Shera Hectorica during the
introduction, right? Please reconsider!”

White interjected, sweating nervously.

“We need to get good grades, right…? Uh, it’s dangerous to be alone…?
With Predators roaming around, it’s safest and most logical to move
together…”

“Why don’t I just catch a Predator?”

Shera chuckled, ‘Hehe.’

White, Abel, and Roanna were at a loss for words.

“You guys are nothing more than baggage\~. Take care of yourselves!”

With those words, Shera cheerfully stepped into the corridor ahead of
them.

The remaining three were so dumbfounded that they had to pause for a
moment, wondering what to say next.

<span id="0143_145_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 145: Joint Practical Evaluation (2)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (2) ༻**

Back to the present. Inside of a passage within Octovus Hall.

White, Abel, and Roanna stared at their bracelets. They were only
progressing forward, yet the number on their bracelets was rising
quickly.

It was likely because one of their teammates, Shera Hectorica, had been
eliminating the other students.

“She must be skilled, that Shera girl from the Magic Department.”

“She is strong.”

White knew Shera Hectorica.

“Her mana is Grade S, but apparently, she hadn’t used her full strength
during the exam. That’s why I remember her. She should be at the top of
Class B.”

“Grade S mana in Class B…?”

A light twinkled in Roanna’s eyes, who had been remaining quiet. She
seemed surprised.

“I have heard that the new grade of the Magic Department students are
especially talented this year… but it’s unimaginable that a Grade S mana
student is in Class B.”

Abel let out an empty laugh. This was understandable since those with
Grade S mana at their age were geniuses beyond the typical spectrum.

Especially as an aspiring magic knight, Abel tended to admire those with
large mana capacities.

“Ah, that is true…”

Though the teams were chosen randomly, grades and skills were also taken
into consideration.

For students with high rankings in Class B to be on the same team meant
that White was that much weaker.

“…”

Tears formed in the corners of White’s eyes.

She was under a sense of sorrowful realization about just how weak she
truly was.

“Anyhow, it doesn’t look like anyone is using large-scale spells. I
would have expected the Magic Department to have used tricks like that.”

“Large-scale spells?”

“You know, like using a tsunami to sweep everyone away…”

With a short ‘Ah.’ White nodded her head.

Now that she thought about it, that was a good question. Why wasn’t
anyone using them?

If one used magic rashly, there was a risk of being caught by those with
high mana perception. So, it was right to keep the magic usage to a
minimum.

But on the other hand, that would not be a problem for those who could
pour out field spells countless times.

“Dumb Sleazo.”

“What’s with the sudden insult, Miss Friend…?”

“You should have seen it earlier. There was a Cherry Bus.”

“That pretty-looking bug?”

“…”

“Can you not look at me like that? I feel insulted.”

Roanna narrowed her eyes and glared at Abel with disgust. She seemed to
contemplate what she should do with such an idiot.

There were all sorts of ridiculous creatures within the labyrinth. The
‘Cherry Bus’ was also one of the creatures implemented in the exam.

If one’s mana came into contact with a Cherry Bus, it would track the
flow of the mana and fly towards it.

Then, it would latch onto the mana trail and consume their flesh and
mana.

If it had already entered one’s body, then the only way to live would be
to amputate that body part.

Since such a dangerous creature was only a fake here, it wouldn’t
actually eat flesh or mana, but it was sure that the user would fail the
exam.

Therefore, using field magic was an excellent method for suicide.

“I didn’t know that…”

“Princess White is understandable. I am only disappointed that the guy
who has studied such an absurd amount of magic beast ecology didn’t even
properly know the dangers of this labyrinth.”

“Hey Friend, I can’t help it. That Cherry Bug or something isn’t a magic
beast; it’s a monster. I’m not interested in monsters.”

“Yeah yeah, you zoophile…”

“Shh.”

Just then, Abel suddenly halted and spread his arms to the side to stop
White and Roanna. White jolted in surprise.

“There’s a presence at three o’clock…”

Even before Abel finished his sentence, Roanna quickly drew her bow and
shot an arrow imbued with magic.

Her light green locks fluttered in the wind mana.

*Spewt-!*

\[Skreeeeeek!!\]

The arrow charged with light green wind mana hit its mark on the demonic
illusion hidden in the dark.

The light from the mana lit up the demonic illusion. It was a monster
similar to a bear with its long, sharp claws but a slender body.

It let out a loud cry before dissipating into a cloud of dust scattered
away by the wind.

“That was amazing, Miss Roanna!”

“It’s good to have you here, Friend!”

“Don’t fall in love with me, though.”

To White and Abel’s cheers, Roanna curtly flicked her hair and put away
her bow.

She was a Knight Department student who had exceptional talent with a
bow. She was also an aspiring Magic Knight like Abel.

“I’ll be depending on you, Roanna!”

“I will also be depending on you, Miss Roanna!”

“…I will be protecting Princess White, but Sleazo, you’re going to be my
meat shield.”

“Meat shield, you say? Haha, that’s funny!”

Abel laughed exaggeratedly with cold sweat droplets running down his
face. He felt that if it was Roanna, then she might actually use him as
a meat shield.

And so, they continued to venture through the darkness.

Without Shera Hectorica, they had to be extra careful to survive.

As they moved forward, they continued to fight whilst searching for
demonic illusions, traps, and scars of elimination hidden within the
darkness.

With her eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness, White eventually found a
way to support them with her wind magic.

*One hour and a half later.*

The three people arrived at the front of a particular passageway.

Fancy lamps lined across the walls with a pale blue light emitting from
them. The atmosphere seemed to change, feeling much colder and more
dangerous than they had experienced.

“Eheheh, it looks like we’ll be able to reach the destination safely
through here\~… Hmm?”

White had been following behind with a smile when Abel and Roanna
suddenly halted on the spot.

In front of them was a single path.

And from their compass, it said that this path was the only way to their
destination.

However…

“What is this…?”

As if the ground had been scarred, countless lines of red mana were
scattered through the path. They were ‘scars of elimination’.

But the number of them… was way too many.

The scars of elimination were messily engraved through the entire
passageway. They couldn’t even be counted with just a short glance.

“There’s something up ahead. But this is the only path we can take…”

Looking down at the compass, Abel spoke up nervously.

In the compass, all of the paths nearby were marked.

The paths they had taken until now had all been split.

It had only been possible for them to have taken a path around other
students and attacked them from behind because there had been multiple
paths.

But… this segment was different. Here, the only way forward to their
goal was to pass through the dark passage that stood before them.

Even though it was clear that there was something highly dangerous past
this dark passage.

“D-do you think it’s a Predator…?”

White asked them in a frightened voice.

Abel and Roanna turned to look at White. A Predator. It was definitely a
possibility they had to consider.

The Predator was someone from Class A or of similar strength to a
student from Class A. That would be a reasonable explanation for why
there were so many scars of elimination here.

White thought of Luce Eltania and Priestess Miya. They were both
monsters. Class A only housed monsters such as those two…

“That means… The Predator hadn’t bothered to wander around and stayed in
this one spot?”

They naturally thought the Predator would have been wandering around.

Nobody could have imagined they would take on the role of gatekeeper on
this single path.

“…Huahh.”

Though she was scared, White had no intention to back down.

With both Abel and Roanna, there may be a way to push forward somehow.

White thought of Isaac’s high-five.

*Let’s do well on this exam,* he said.

So she decided to push forward, at least for the sake of Isaac, who had
worked so hard to help her.

“I-it’s alright…!”

But the catch was that White’s voice was not yet settled.

“There isn’t any need to beat the Predator. We could somehow distract
them… Then quickly escape to the next route.”

“I agree!”

Abel raised both his hands next to his face with a carefree smile and
played along to White’s comment.

“We can’t back down here; it’s the only path, after all\~. Roanna, what
do you want to do?”

“Sleazo, you take the lead and be the meat shield.”

“Hahah, you’re such a terrible friend!”

Abel responded cheerfully to Roanna’s callous comment.

Their objective was to obtain a high grade. Even if the Predator was
waiting for them ahead, not a single one of them wanted to stop here.

Not to mention, the points they could obtain decreased as time passed,
and they did not know who their opponent was. They didn’t have the
leisure of formulating a detailed plan.

It was time to push forward.

The three people took a short moment to plan a simple strategy that
utilized their specialties.

Abel grasped the sheath of the sword on his belt.

Roanna took out her bow and readied for battle.

White calculated various formulas in her mind and finished various
preparations for her magic.

“…Let’s go.”

They steeled their resolve and stepped foot into the dark passageway.

Roanna placed a cover over their lamp so that they would merge into the
darkness.

Both Roanna and Abel then felt that deciding to use a surprise attack
had not been a wise strategy.

Not only did they have limited vision here, but their position was also
far from ideal.

If they rashly used long-range attacks and instead were counterattacked
in this narrow passage, then they would be utterly helpless in
protecting themselves.

Abel felt his foot come in contact with something wet on the ground. The
floor had a shallow layer of water that submerged the soles of their
shoes.

They needed to be wary of the sound of their footsteps. The three
students turned to one another and nodded, then slowly and carefully
proceeded one step at a time.

Eventually, light shone upon them once again.

They finally reached the passageway, and their view became clear.

The humid yet cold air stung their skin.

The ground was still covered with a shallow layer of water. Floating on
that water were pieces of thin ice in the shape of ice crystals.

On the high walls, several luxurious lamps scattered a pale blue light
through the clean-kept room.

Sitting in a chair made of ice magic in the middle of the room…

…Was a male student with silver-blue hair with his head down, which
White, Abel, and Roanna then saw.

The magic weapon, Zhonya’s Staff, leaned against the silver-blue-haired
student’s shoulder. The mana stone attached to the weapon reflected pale
blue light from the lamps, glowing like the moon in the night sky.

Abel and Roanna swallowed anxiously. It hadn’t been difficult to
instinctively realize that the man standing before them was a
‘Predator’.

Meanwhile, White’s eyes were shaking visibly. She could not hide her
surprise.

“You’re here.”

A calm voice. The silver-blue-haired man raised his head.

A blue brooch was pinned to his tie. The color that represented the
second year.

On the outside, the round glasses and soft impression he held made him
seem like the typical kind-hearted senior.

But White knew very well what sort of person he was.

Unlike his appearance, he was overly firm.

And an incredibly calculative and cunning man. Which made him an
admirable mentor to her.

“Senior Isaac…?”

“Unfortunately.”

The silver-blue-haired student stood up from his ice chair and held
Zhonya’s Staff upright on the ground.

Then he took off his glasses.

“You shall not pass.”

This was the only path that led to the Eltra Sea.

He could not let a single person pass through this point during this
joint practical evaluation.

Because that was one of the criteria for obtaining the ‘Ring of the
Abyssal Queen’ from the Abyssal Sea Monster while also being the way to
protect everyone from it.

Predator.

Isaac, first in Class B for the second years of the Magic Department.

The frigid chill he emitted spread out around him.

Chapter 146: Joint Practical Evaluation (3)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (3) ༻**

46 times.

That was the number of times my bones had suffered a fracture during the
winter break.

It made me realize the greatness of healing magic once again. It could
mend broken bones perfectly within a day or two.

During the winter break, I often visited Stone Turtle – Gormos. Fighting
against the golem minions he created was very helpful in honing my
practical skills.

I suffered countless defeats at the hands of his minions. I seized
dozens of victories, then faced the next level of minions, only to
confront them over and over.

Before the end of the winter break, I was able to battle with the
compressed golem, which had been my goal.

It was a 2-meter-tall golem. It was smaller compared to the
dinosaur-sized regular golem minions.

Its rock fists were incredibly fast, and each hit felt like my insides
would burst.

It was agile. Its attacks were skillful and the power of its magic was
the strongest I had ever faced, making it quite challenging.

That excited me. I was certain that defeating it would elevate me to a
new level.

So I fought with the thought of wrecking my body.

No matter how many times my bones broke, no matter how much blood and
sweat I shed, I poured out all my strength into defeating Gormos’
minion.

Finally, the day before the end of winter break, I defeated the
compressed golem.

I was so thrilled that I forgot all about the pain, I shouted in
jubilation until my throat was hoarse.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 110

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** (2nd)

**Title:** Skilled Second Year

**Mana:** 30000/30000

– Mana Recovery Speed (A-)

The light from the lamp shined down.

There were three enemies in front of me now. Originally, there were
four, but the paladin Shera, who was part of their group, was acting
independently. I knew this from observing them with \[Clairvoyance\].

The first opponent was Snow White, level 39. Her element was wind. She
was an opponent who required moderate caution.

Next was Abel Carnedes, a first-year from the Knight Department, class
B, rank 1, level 90. His elements were water and fire. A swordsman with
great talent. He prided himself on his agile movements and excellent
reflexes, reminiscent of the top predator of the food chain.

He knew how to harmoniously combine sharp sword strikes with powerful
elemental magic. Indeed, he possessed skills befitting an aspiring magic
knight.

By the way, he played a significant supporting role in the second year
of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Lastly, Roanna Shelton, she was in the upper ranks of class B, level 87.
Her element was wind. Anyone she targets must forget about evading any
of her arrows. Even if you tried to, she’d subtly adjust their
trajectory with her wind to ensure a hit. She even amplified the power
of her arrows with wind magic.

Her vision was naturally excellent befitting her status as an archer,
Her ability to track the flow of mana was also exceptionally
outstanding. Additionally, she was the girl who became Abel’s lover.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there definitely was no such team.

The entrance of the four paladins certainly had a significant impact on
the composition of teams in the joint practical evaluation.

Anyway, my task remained the same.

My objective was to hold my ground and not give way until the Abyssal
Sea Monster appeared.

I had to prevent anyone’s mana from being absorbed into the Ring of the
Abyssal Queen, held by the mid-boss of the Abyssal Sea Monster section.

◈ vs. Race Combat Power – vs. Human Combat Power (D+): 20/100 \[UP\]

I obtained the unique trait \[Rapid growth\] by maxing out the potential
‘Growth Rate’.

The effect was simple. It doubles the stat points gained with each level
increase.

As a result, from level 106, where I had maxed out my growth rate, to
level 110, I gained a total of 16 new stat points.

I invested them all in \[vs. Human Combat Power \].

The effect of ‘Vs. Race Combat Power’ was the same for all. For every 10
stats points invested, one’s level against the selected race would
increase by 5 and amplify the magic you used against it.

And when you hit the MAX of 100 stats, you gain a new unique trait, the
effect of which inflates the increase in level and abilities.

The effect of my unique trait \[Hunter\] doubled the effects of \[vs.
Demon Combat Power\]. The same could be assumed for others.

Currently, my \[vs. Human Combat power\] was 20.

Thus, my level temporarily increased by 10.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** (120)

White might have noticed that my mana had increased, but this level of
increase could reasonably be passed off as a buff from Zhonya’s Staff, a
2nd-tier magic weapon.

I had already laid the groundwork in case of such a situation.

Two weeks ago, I had explained what Zhonya’s Staff was during a
discussion about magic weapons, mentioning that it enhances the power of
my magic and increases the density of my mana.

And there was one more thing I had prepared in advance for today.

The glasses I took off were Ribella’s Glasses’, a magic tool with useful
effects. The longer one wore them, the greater the buff to tracking mana
one received when they took the glasses off. Of course, there are limits
to this effect.

It was similar to the feeling of one’s legs becoming incredibly light as
if they could fly away, after taking off sandbags that one had been
wearing.

I rapidly circulated my mana, exhaling cold air.

I prepared for battle and looked at White and her group with a sneer.

These juniors were the eighth group I was going to take down.

\* \* \*

Isaac’s chill dominated the space.

The surroundings began to freeze over in a fearsome manner, turning
eerily pale.

The shallow seawater pooled on the ground quickly turned into a sheet of
ice.

*Splash—!*

A flash of light poured from Abel’s scabbard, etching his form into the
air.

Drawing his sword, a strike wrapped in water mana plunged into the
ground.

A wall of water rose, momentarily blocking the cold.

“Roanna!”

*Whooooosh──!*

Roanna’s light green wind, as if waiting for the right moment, surged
forth. The mana wind lifted White and her companions.

Lifting bodies with wind magic consumed a significant amount of mana,
causing Roanna to squint one eye, feeling an intense strain, as if her
body was twisting.

Even the water wall raised by Abel froze solidly.

As Isaac’s chill enveloped the area, turning the ground into an ice
sheet, Roanna retracted her wind, allowing everyone to firmly plant
their feet on the ground.

“Ha, we almost got wiped out right from the start…”

Abel let out a chuckle mixed with white breath.

The water pooled on the ground from the beginning must have been
prepared by Isaac, probably using a water element scroll.

The fact that water remained despite many students already being
eliminated by the senior with the ice element allowed Abel and Roanna to
discern Isaac’s strategy.

Simply spreading cold air could quickly freeze their feet. That must
have been his plan to create vulnerabilities.

Abel and Roanna were certain. The moment they showed even a brief gap
against Isaac, their defeat would be sealed.

In a defensive stance, Abel adjusted his posture with his sword, Roanna
drew her bowstring aiming at Isaac, and behind them, White deployed a
light green magic circle.

The fiercely blowing cold wind was bone-chilling.

Coldness numbs the body. Abel ignited fierce flames on his blade,
seeking warmth as if in front of a campfire in the cold.

There was no time for conversation. They needed to quickly gather
information about the enemy.

Abel shouted.

“Princess White, do you know who that senior is?!”

“Yes, he’s my mentor! Senior Isaac…! This is the first time I’ve seen
him handling ice magic…!”

White focused her sight on her mentor beyond the frigid chill.

Isaac. His primary element was ice, and his secondary element was rock,
as she had heard.

“We need information! Anything! About that senior!”

“Information…? Huh…?”

Suddenly, a sense of incongruity struck her.

White realized she had no useful information to aid the battle.

She had never seen Isaac use ice magic before. Hadn’t he only ever used
simple rock magic in her presence?

Why hadn’t she ever questioned this before?

She reflected on their almost daily mentoring sessions.

It seemed as if Isaac had deliberately hidden his power, never once
showing or talking about his full capabilities.

“I’m, I’m sorry! I don’t have anything! Ahh!”

*Whooooooosh───!!*

Isaac’s chill turned into a whitish mist, obscuring their vision and
building up an intensity that made even breathing seem distant.

The cold wind was imbued with the the two-star spell, \[Snow Pellets\].
\[Snow Pellets\] bounced wildly in the space that had turned into an ice
rink, creating a chaotic noise.

Before Isaac disappeared from sight, Roanna shot an arrow imbued with
wind magic,

As if it had been anticipated, an ice wall sprang up at the perfect
moment to intercept the arrow, which bounced off with a thud.

The flames blazing on the blade of Abel’s sword finally succumbed to the
chill. Then, he shouted.

“Roanna! Support!”

“Got it!”

“I’ll join in too!”

*Fwoosh──!*

*Whooosh──!*

Abel unleashed the flames of the sword, cleaving through the chill as he
charged. White augmented the power of the flames by stirring up wind
around Abel.

Roanna drew her bowstring. While Abel cleaved through the white coldness
with his flaming sword, her eyes tracked Isaac, hidden within the cold
wind.

The dense cold air, formed from ice mana, swirled savagely. Even with
her mana perception and ability to track the flow of mana, it was
difficult to locate Isaac.

Tracking by sound? Useless. The noise created by \[Snow Pellets\]
drowned out all other sounds.

Securing visibility in the pale coldness was difficult,

But Roanna only needed to wait for a moment of vulnerability. The moment
Isaac exposed himself to confront Abel was when she planned to release
her arrow.

Or, she had to wait for when Isaac would use magic.

Whether he attacked or defended, as long as he used magic, she could
swiftly identify the source of the magic and aim her arrow in that
direction.

Roanna was confident. The thought of Isaac trying to hide from her
seemed almost laughable.

“Go ahead and use your ice walls or whatever, Senior! Or are you
scared?!”

Abel swung his flaming sword repeatedly, boldly taunting.

He was confident in his mana perception.

No matter how chaotically the ice mana swirled, making it difficult to
track Isaac, he could pinpoint Isaac’s location by sensing the intense
mana when he was about to use magic.

A cold sensation.

Abel felt dense mana behind his head.

“…!”

Abel halted and urgently turned around.

His eyes widened. With a startled expression, he shouted.

“Everyone, dodge!!”

Roanna and White also had their eyes wide open in shock.

Because they felt Isaac’s mana, somehow, from beneath their feet.

Tracking the source of mana was the fundamental basics of battling a
wizard. So, they had arrogantly followed this principle.

But there was no way Isaac wouldn’t have anticipated that.

Time seemed to stop. As a pale blue radiance burst from the ice beneath
their feet, Roanna instinctively raised the wind to push White back.

「Wind Generation (Wind Element, ★1)」

*Whoooosh!*

“Aaah!”

White was pushed away, screaming.

At the same time, Roanna also tried to retreat, but…

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Boom─────!!*

A pale blue mana explosion erupted from the ground.

Shards of ice flew in all directions. Within the mass of ice that
appeared in a flash, half of Roanna’s body was engulfed in it.

Roanna’s body, lifted by the force of the magical explosion, was caught
by the rising mass of ice.

None of White’s group understood what had just happened.

They wouldn’t have known that beneath the ice laid the Sheath of
Disaster, imbued with just enough mana for use in human combat.

Abel bit his lip, regretting that had he been there, he could have
either avoided the \[Frost Explosion\] with Roanna or blocked it with
his fiery sword strike. He was confident he could have countered a
\[Frost Explosion\] of that magnitude.

Suddenly, a question arose.

Why hadn’t Isaac activated that magic tool from the beginning?

It was as if he had been waiting for Abel to be separated from his
group. It was as if he knew the extent of Abel’s skills.

At that moment.

*Whoosh─!*

“…!”

A man with silver-blue hair burst through the pale cold wind.

It was Isaac.

<span id="0145_147_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 147: Joint Practical Evaluation (4)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (4) ༻**

Abel was surprised. He hadn’t expected the enemy wizard to close the
distance first.

Quite obviously, wizards had an advantage in long-range combat. With
their strength concentrated more on magic than physical power, it was
suicide for them to fight close-range with a physical type like Abel.

Moreover, Isaac hadn’t used magic.

If he had created a magic circle to use magic, Abel would have instantly
realized it and made preparations, but perhaps Isaac even expected that.
Unable to sense his mana, Abel had let his guard down.

In Isaac’s right hand was a dagger, and in his left was Zanya’s Staff.
Slicing through the frigid air, his dagger left a silver trail.

*Whoosh—!*

Abel instinctively pulled his head back and avoided the dagger. Several
strands of his blue-gray hair scattered into the cold air.

Abel then used his sword to block Isaac’s consecutive attack.

*Clang—!*

Two pale figures crossed to create sparks. A sharp collision rang
through the cold.

Abel was amazed.

‘Isn’t he from the Magic Department? What’s this agility and strength?’

The physical strength the senior in front of him possessed was at a
level where he had doubts about whether or not he was a student of the
Magic Department. He could very well be in the Knight Department.

There was no time to spare. A pale blue magic circle appeared around
Isaac.

When he felt the man’s mana up close, he was reminded that Isaac was
indeed in the Magic Department. His mana sent a shiver down Abel’s
spine.

“Tch!”

Abel quickly leaped back to retreat and created an orange magic circle.
Flames began to glow.

Simultaneously, White, who had returned to her senses, shot the 3-star
spell \[Wind Sword\] from the passageway. The light green blade stormed
towards Isaac.

However, the one to cast a spell first was Isaac.

「Frostfire (Ice Element, ★4)」

*Fwooooosh——–!*

Abel and White’s magic was swallowed up helplessly by the pale blue ice
flame.

Abel then reflexively slashed his fire-imbued sword to slice
\[Frostfire\].

*Baaaang——!*

“Argh!”

The high-temperature flame and low-temperature cold clashed violently
and caused a steam explosion, throwing Abel back like a ball.

He expected to have escaped from immediate danger in this way, but he
had already fallen into Isaac’s trap the moment he collided blades with
Isaac.

*Tuk—!*

“…?!”

Abel’s body soon came in contact with a cold and hard surface.

The 4-star defense magic, \[Ice Wall\]. The wall of ice had risen behind
him at some point.

When Isaac created a magic circle for \[Frostfire\] and allowed Abel to
track his ice mana.

He had distracted them with \[Frostfire\] and summoned \[Ice Wall\] in
advance.

A flurry of cold wind. Loud du-du-du- sounds as \[Ice Pellets\] was shot
mercilessly at the icy surroundings.

In the middle of that storm, Abel trembled in fear at the powerful enemy
that stood past the hazy frost.

Overwhelming strength.

The only thing he could do in the face of it was cower in fear.

*Vwoosh–!*

*Phuack–!*

“Khuack!”

*Crashhh—-!*

Explosive sounds echoed through the room. Ignoring the sword Abel was
holding, a strong kick shot through the fog and connected with his
stomach. The feeling was similar to a strike received from a metal bat
made of steel plates.

The \[Ice Wall\] crumbled, and Abel’s body flew through the air. His
body tumbled across the ice floor several times before crashing against
the wall near the passageway.

*D-d-d-d-d-dk——!*

At the same time, ice flowing with light brown rock mana, \[Fossilized
Ice\], floated up and encircled his body.

Like a prisoner in a camp who’d been tied up, he was unable to move,
coughing up blood. He was amazed by the opponent’s mastery of mana, as
even the \[Fossilized Ice\] surrounding him was intricately controlled.

“Grrgh… Hahah… So damn strong…”

With a dismal laugh, Abel let out a groan. He assumed that he had broken
a rib.

It hurt terribly, but it had only been one hit. He was still more than
able to move. There was still a chance to strike back. As a student of
Marchen Academy’s Knight Department, and with his friend Roanna out of
commission, he couldn’t lose like this.

He vowed to land an attack on the silver-blue-haired senior somehow.

This was a matter of his pride and self-esteem.

He created an orange magic circle to summon flames. Though weaker in
power than students in the Magic Department of the same grade, he
planned to melt that ice with it.

But a chill, cold enough to freeze his entire body spewed out of
\[Fossilized Ice\]. Abel’s flames lacked both the heat and power to melt
the ice.

“Uugh…”

In a rush, Abel was unable to muster up miraculous strength.

In the end, Abel’s body slowly froze up from the severe cold, and
eventually, his head fell limp. He had lost consciousness.

“S-s-s-senior I-I-I-Isaac…. Kueah!”

Walking through the flurry of cold wind, Isaac slowly approached White.

「Wind Sword (Wind Element, ★3)」

*Whish!*

With a frightened expression, White took several steps back before using
the light green magic circle she had created to shoot out \[Wind
Sword\].

The blade of wind quickly sliced the air. However, Isaac swiftly twisted
his body to the side and dodged \[Wind Sword\].

“Huh?”

White swallowed in shock.

Since Isaac had been wearing Rivela’s Glasses for a while now, he could
track mana flow much easier than usual.

In addition, because of his physical abilities and reflexes, it was
nearly impossible for White to land a hit on him with magic.

“Huaah!”

White fell backward and landed on her bottom. A short cry escaped her
mouth.

At some point, tears had begun to form in her eyes out of fear.

Roanna had fallen unconscious with half of her body trapped in an ice
block.

Abel sank into a deep slumber from the frigid cold of \[Fossilized
Ice\].

Isaac, their silver-blue-haired senior, had complete control over the
battlefield.

It even felt like her heart was freezing up. That was how cold Isaac’s
eyes felt. It was hard to believe he was the same person who had been
mentoring her with such a kind smile.

“White.”

Isaac leaned on Zanya’s staff for support and crouched down to meet
White at eye level. Even his voice was cold like frost.

His hand extended out to reach at White.

“Hic…!”

Surprised, White clenched her eyes shut.

“…?”

But then, after feeling a pat on her head, White slowly reopened her
eyes with uncertainty.

Isaac had been patting her head.

The flurrying ice storm settled. What came into view was similar to that
of a frozen cavern.

The ice and frost instantly disappeared into a pale blue dust.

And Isaac’s usual kind smile, the one which White was familiar with,
returned.

His expression couldn’t seem any more innocent, making it hard to
believe he was the enemy who obliterated her entire team just a moment
ago.

“You’ve certainly improved. It was a good plan, trying to pass through
the cold with your teammates.”

“…?”

Confusion.

White felt a complicated mixture of emotions. Fear that caused her heart
to race and a faint sense of pride swarmed over her at once.

“And you helped raise that friend’s firepower, right? That’s not easy to
do. Good job. It was impressive that you continued resisting until the
end.”

“Senior Isaac…?”

Isaac continued to pat White’s head gently, and as he did so, her tense
mind gradually began to relax.

It was a drastic change of mood. Perhaps it was because of that, but
Isaac’s tender touch and compliments felt incredibly pleasant.

As her tension slowly loosened, White’s eyes began watering, tears
threatening to fall at any moment.

“Senior Isaac… I like it better when you smile…”

White cried out as she spread her arms, asking for a hug.

Isaac grinned at her behavior, responding with a quiet, “Alright.”

“But first, stay still for a moment.”

“Okaaaaay? W-wait, Senior Isaac?!”

Isaac leaned closer towards White, then gently wrapped his hand around
her wrist.

It wasn’t just one wrist. Just a breath away from White, Isaac grabbed
hold of both her wrists.

She felt the warm breath of the same man with an ice storm swirling
around him just minutes ago. Gazing upon Isaac’s jawline and throat,
which could be seen every time he moved his head, White swallowed
nervously from a new strange sensation.

She had also admitted that Isaac was quite handsome, so the current view
was highly provocative for White, who was in puberty.

To her, who was the only member of the imperial family not to hold much
significance over social status, it did not matter that the person in
question was a commoner.

“S-s-s-s-s-senior Isaac…? W-w-w-what is this…? Huahh…”

White shook like a broken machine.

Isaac raised both of White’s wrists above her head. As parts too
embarrassing to mention became more prominently in her view, their
positioning only seemed to become more sensual.

Flustered, White’s entire face turned red.

Up against Senior Isaac, whom she didn’t have the courage to fight
against, and with her mood relaxed, the sudden series of events seemed
to have prevented her from thinking straight.

“White.”

“Y-y-yes…?”

Gazing down on White up close, they seemed to have forgotten how to
breathe entirely.

“You can rest now.”

*Rumble–.*

With a bright smile, he used \[Rock Generation\] and cuffed her wrists
with rock handcuffs.

“…Ah.”

White’s tension loosened once more.

And when he cuffed White’s ankles soon after, she fell into a daze with
her face ashen white.

“You don’t plan on resisting, right?”

“Yes…”

“With this, you’ll be considered as incapacitated… What’s wrong, White?”

“It’s nothing…”

White whipped her watery eyes to the side. A frustrated laugh escaped
her mouth. She felt ashamed that she had just felt such sinful desires
for her admirable senior, even if it had been just for a moment.

Just then, an object precariously dangling from White’s jacket pocket
fell out and dropped on the ground. Both Isaac and White’s eyes turned
to look at it.

“Ah…!”

Her small, platinum pocket watch. Colliding with the ground, its lid
opened to show the beautiful astral clock face and the unmoving hands.

White flinched in surprise, but she could not pick it back up because
her arms and legs were restrained. In a hurry, she asked Isaac for help.

“S-senior Isaac. C-can you put that back in my pocket? It’s something
precious to…”

However, Isaac just continued to stare at the pocket watch without
replying.

And as if he were shocked by something unexpected, his eyes widened
significantly.

“Senior Isaac?”

White realized that Isaac was currently in deep thought.

But because he never revealed his intentions, she did not know what
those thoughts were.

However, the time that he took to think was short. He picked up the
pocket watch and placed it back in White’s jacket pocket.

“Make sure not to lose it if it’s precious to you.”

“Ah… Okay…”

With those final words, Isaac no longer spoke to White.

This current change puzzled White.

A minute later. A female exam proctor arrived.

Seated in his ice chair, Isaac greeted her with a smile.

With an obligatory, “Good work\~.” She carried away White’s group with
her wind magic.

“…”

Isaac rubbed his lower lip with his finger and sank into deep thought.

An impossible speculation was forming inside of his mind.

<span id="0146_148_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 148: Joint Practical Evaluation (5)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (5) ༻**

A flood of pink flames erupted. It was the fire magic from the Heart
Paladin, Shera Hectorica.

Shera easily defeated every student she encountered. There wasn’t a
first-year around who could stand against her flames.

However, what she desired was not to eliminate insignificant first-year
students. There wasn’t any fun to be had in trampling ants after all.

Shera grunted in annoyance.

“Where are the Predators…!”

In this place, as vast and complex as a maze, known as Octovus Hall, the
goal of every Paladin was the same.

Hunting the Predators. They had to focus particularly on the ice
element.

Though it wasn’t something that could be discussed beforehand, the
Paladins understood that they needed to target the Predators upon
hearing the exam rules.

Their objective was to thwart the plan of The Black Monster, The
Nameless Hero, and uncover his identity.

If he participated in this exam, they concluded he must be a Predator.

This was because, during last year’s Märchen Academy Magic Department
first year exams, demons often appeared, and the Black Monster appeared
each time as well.

If the Black Monster was a student, there was a high probability that he
was now a second-year student.

Even if the Black Monster was not here, there was no loss. There were
still opportunities remaining.

“…!”

It was while they were traversing Octovus Hall, that they arrived at a
vast space.

Suddenly, a strong flow of mana swept through like a whirlwind, brushing
against Shera’s skin. The mana was emanating from the corridor on the
opposite side.

Shera widened her eyes in surprise and looked towards the other side.

A female student with rose-gold hair walked towards her, swaying gently.
As she spotted Shera, she stopped, her expression indifferent.

A second-year blue gem brooch was attached to her uniform ribbon. Five
blue magic circles floated above her head.

A smile spread across Shera’s lips.

“Luce Eltania…”

Finally, an opponent who could entertain her had appeared.

When encountering the Predator, one must choose to either fight or flee.

However, Shera knew from her extensive combat experience that she could
never flee from a confrontation with Luce Eltania.

It was what she had hoped for.

Shera deployed her orange magic circle.

There was no need for conversation. As if following an unspoken
agreement, the two poured forth elemental magic at each other.

\* \* \*

White’s pocket watch was different from what I remembered. The reason
for this was still unknown.

The discovery of a new variable stirred a multitude of complex thoughts
in my mind.

However, I had to set those thoughts aside for the moment. It was
gradually becoming time for the Abyssal Sea Monster to emerge. I could
tell from the watch on the exam bracelet.

After dispelling the ice chair with defrost, I moved towards the passage
leading to the Eltra Sea.

While walking, I continually observed the Paladins using my
\[Clairvoyance\].

Presumably, they were out hunting Predators like me.

When the exam began, except for the sociable model student the Clover
Paladin, the rest of the Paladins quickly left their teams and began
eliminating students at a terrifying pace.

They seemed to be operating under the assumption that I had joined this
exam.

‘They must think I’m at least a second-year student.’

Last year, various demons appeared during the Magic Department’s
first-year exams, and each time, the Black Monster also appeared.

Moreover, during the joint practical evaluation, including the Eltra Sea
where the Abyssal Sea Monster appears, all destinations were under
barriers, and access was controlled.

Last year, the Black Monster acted as if he knew the exam schedule. The
Paladins might have thought he would do the same this year.

In other words, there was a sufficient possibility that the Black
Monster was hiding his identity and intervening in various exams to hunt
demons.

However, fortunately, they overlooked one fact.

‘Octovus Hall is much larger than they think.’

This place was a facility created by hollowing out the bottom part of a
vast island.

Usually off-limits, most people were unaware of its internal structure,
including the student council president, Alice Carroll.

Octovus Hall was a vast, maze-like facility, making a compass essential.

Here, the compass was specifically for the exam. It only pointed towards
the destination, and its only other function was to display a map.

Even with a compass, if the Eltra Sea was not set as the destination, it
would be useless to the Paladins except for its map function.

The fact that the Paladins hadn’t yet come my way, even though the
Abyssal Sea Monster was due to appear soon, proved that they were lost
in Octovus Hall.

In that regard, the goddess of fortune was on my side.

Of course, when the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared, anyone would be able
to feel its strong mana and determine the direction of the Eltra Sea.

‘By the time everything plays out, it’ll already be over.’

When the Abyssa Seal Monster appeared, the test bracelets lost their
function and broke down completely, due to its passive skill \[Mana
Drain\].

As a side note, from what I remember in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the
academy found it difficult to track the location of each and every
student, so they primarily focused on monitoring the locations of those
who had been eliminated.

In other words, unless I made myself conspicuous, I was unlikely to
arouse suspicion from the academy’s faculty.

When the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared, it wouldn’t be long before all
the exits of Octovus Hall were automatically sealed.

To prepare for the appearance of demons, Hegel Magic Tower developed a
robust protective magic last year.

It was difficult for anyone in Octovus Hall, including myself, to easily
break through.

“The right timing would be.”

After the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared.

To escape to Eltra Sea before the exits were sealed.

It meant I needed to time my exit well.

The exam proctors who had waited at the Eltra Sea coast were to have
retreated to the gathering point under the condition that no students
were present once the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared. I had already
successfully met that condition.

Returning to the current situation.

The Heart Paladin had encountered Luce Eltania. If there were no
variables, Luce was likely to win.

The other Paladins were wandering in the wrong direction. Diamond
Paladin had defeated a group and had taken their compass.

It was a compass leading to the Eltra Sea. The direction the needle
pointed was where I intended to go, and it was identified as ‘Eltra Sea
Coast’ on the surface of the compass.

Since the Paladins needed to know the direction to the Eltra Sea, it was
apparent that the Diamond Paladin had located the required compass.

As a side note, the naive Shera, excited about catching a Predator
first, seemed to have rashly embarked on solo action.

She left her team as soon as the exam started, not knowing that her
team’s compass was pointing towards the Eltra Sea coast.

“Well, it should be fine.”

Fortunately, the Diamond Paladin was in the wrong place quite a distance
away. she had to go around in circles to find the way.

Indeed, today, the goddess of fortune was on my side. I wouldn’t be
hindered by that girl.

As I thought about this and continued forward.

“…What?”

…I stopped in my tracks without realizing it.

I focused on \[Clairvoyance\].

Suddenly, I caught my breath at the extraordinary actions of a female
student, Alexa, marked with a golden diamond pattern on her forehead.

She was charging rapidly towards my intended path, breaking through
walls.

*BOOM*

*BOOM*

The booming sounds reached here and were getting gradually getting
closer.

The air vibrated noisily as if there was an earthquake. The ground also
rumbled loudly.

Students scattered throughout Octovus Hall were all startled and stopped
in their tracks.

***No way, that’s insane. Who destroys the exam hall while taking an
exam…?!***

I never expected her to rudely carve a path like this. Even the Italian
explorer Columbus would have admired such audacity.

The thick walls were being blasted open. I could break trees or rocks
with my fists, but the Diamond Paladin was on another level.

Cold sweat ran down my cheeks. I regained my composure and quickly
crossed the corridor.

As expected, the exam proctor went to stop the Diamond Paladin, Alexa.

However, she attacked the proctor with rock magic and knocked him out.
It was a merciless strike delivered expressionlessly.

***She’s accumulating quite the stack of penalties…***

‘She’s really going all out.’

Alice probably didn’t enroll her to draw such attention.

I take back saying the goddess of fortune was on my side. She was
capricious.

If I continued this way, our paths would inevitably cross. I was bound
to encounter her on the way to the Eltra Sea.

But rushing to the Eltra Sea first wasn’t a good idea.

My position was still being monitored by the exam bracelet, so clumsy
actions were strictly forbidden.

Moreover, there were exam proctors outside the exit. I couldn’t go out
until the proctors had retreated to the gathering point.

***So… what should I do?***

Firstly, I couldn’t avoid a confrontation with Alexa.

Her path was straightforward.

From that point on, it was logical to recall all the traps and useful
features of the joint practical evaluation to formulate a strategy on
how to ambush her.

“Huh?”

Then, something unexpected happened.

A man, with an arrogant smile, blocked the path of the diamond female
student, Alexa.

“Tristan…?”

It was the vain, blond nobleman, Tristan Humphrey.

\* \* \*

*Bang!*

In a wide space lit by lamps on the walls, at a point where several
paths intersected.

A powerful rock magic broke through the wall, and Alexa, a female
student with a square diamond pattern on her forehead, emerged.

“Ha!”

“…?”

A sudden short chuckle stopped Alexa in her tracks.

Amid the dust raised by the collapsing wall, a blond male student stood
facing Alexa directly.

“I’ve heard there were many insolent juniors…”

The dust quickly settled.

The brooch on the blond student’s tie flashed once with an aquamarine
light.

“But I never thought I’d see someone foolish enough to destroy the very
purpose of the exam.”

He was a Predator. Tristan Humphrey, ranked second in Class B, a
second-year of the Magic Department.

Alexa’s rock magic circles, etched in the air, targeted Tristan.

Tristan swiftly deployed four wind magic circles, all aiming at Alexa.

The clash of mana waves created a fierce gust that swept over them.

“…”

Alexa sensed Tristan’s mana and realized she was stronger. However,
Tristan’s fearless demeanor made her feel a sense of doubt.

Being overwhelmed by fear in the face of a strong opponent meant never
reaching a higher realm. This was a lesson Tristan Humphrey had learned
after being effortlessly swept away by Luce Eltania’s magic in last
year’s end-of-semester evaluation.

Looking back, it was true. Before Luce appeared at the end-of-semester
evaluation, the audacious commoner, Isaac, had faced many foes,
including A-class students and Tristan himself, without hesitation. No
trace of fear was seen in him.

The sheer willpower. The determination as if saying, ‘I will defeat you
all’ shimmered in his eyes, Tristan remembered it well.

Reflecting on this memory during the winter break, Tristan had to admit
that Isaac was inherently superior. It was a realization that came with
gritted teeth.

Thus, he trained relentlessly. He didn’t want to lose to Isaac.
Tristan’s winter break was filled with grueling training.

His will surged fiercely, determined to overcome whoever or whatever
crossed his path.

Tristan could sense how strong his junior, Alexa, was through her mana.
Yet, he smirked as if finding her laughably insignificant, as if unable
to even feel fear.

“I, the superior one, shall personally teach you a lesson!”

Tristan laughed heartily, “Kahaha!”

Soon after, he choked and coughed, seemingly catching his breath.

<span id="0147_149_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_6.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 149: Joint Practical Evaluation (6)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (6) ༻**

***You are special.***

That one sentence…

…It was that one sentence his serious-faced father, who had ignored him
until then, had said to Tristan that drastically changed his crooked
lifestyle.

He shortened the time he slept to study and continued to train his magic
even when blood would spill out of his nose.

Believing that he was improving by the day, his eyes were always looking
forward, toward the man he would become.

Living in such a manner, his strength grew by the day, and he earned the
respect of everyone in the mansion.

Being raised on such a pedestal, he felt that he would become the one
who would need to take responsibility for every single one of them and
that they were his people.

So, he felt obligated to live so their respect would not be in vain.

This was why, as if he were continuing to remind the others about just
how amazing of a person they were serving, Tristan laughed valiantly and
repeated the phrase, ‘I am special and superior!’

He hid the times stained by blood and sweat behind the mask named
arrogance.

Tristan always smiled boldly, to follow his lead.

That was the attitude of one who stood on top. It was the way of life
that Tristan Humphrey had cultivated to be his.

\*\*\*

Alexa, the female student with a golden diamond mark etched on her
forehead, remained expressionless. The right arm she had extended aimed
for Tristan Humphrey.

Tristan’s eyes saw the reality. Elemental advantage and difference in
mana. The female student standing before him was much stronger than
himself.

But hadn’t he seen how those weaker than their opponent had fought
countless times here at the Märchen Academy?

Indeed. That was Isaac’s way of fighting.

Twice, he had fought with that cheeky bastard, and Tristan hadn’t won
satisfyingly once.

But he had to accept what should be accepted. If Isaac had given him a
realization, then he must take it. Because he must become stronger.

That was also why he threw away the stupid idea that the best defense
was offense and concentrated on his defense magic.

Moreover, this damned academy still had many students who were stronger
than him.

That female underclassman had about the same mana as Luce Eltania and
Kaya Astrea.

***But does that mean he will retreat?***

‘Hah! As if.’

He had come to Märchen Academy to become a legendary wizard. Avoiding a
battle was something that he could not allow.

***Everything inside of this damn academy is merely food for his
growth.***

*Whoooooosh—-!*

Tristan’s light green winds blew aggressively.

“Come fight me, brat.”

A confident smile drew across his face.

“…”

Alexa did not respond. Was there any reason to? She merely followed
Alice Carroll’s command and fought for the kingdom.

She could quickly get rid of that arrogant and weak-looking blond in an
instant.

Then, Alexa’s rock magic circle began to glow brightly.

*Rrumbleee–!*

Pillars of rocks shot up from the ground and fiercely cut through the
air toward Tristan.

A 4-star rock spell, \[Rock Avalanche\].

Tristan couldn’t even begin to estimate the density of mana within that
ocher boulder. Most spells wouldn’t even make a dent in that rock.

In the first place, removing one’s fear in front of an overwhelmingly
powerful enemy did not resolve the fundamental problem of the difference
in strength.

But his objective was to fight on par with the opponent no matter how
much stronger they were and, in the end, claim victory.

Tristan found a hint of that goal in Isaac’s combat style.

And the results of countless days of pondering and training were now
inside his body.

His wind was not directed at the enemy but at himself.

*Crashhh—!*

Five rock pillars warded away the spiral of wind and attempted to crush
Tristan, but he disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Alexa was confused.

“Where did he…?”

Alexa’s eyes quickly searched around to track Tristan’s mana.

“…!”

*Whoosh–!*

*Boom—!*

But suddenly, she received a powerful impact to her side and tumbled
across the ground.

An explosion of concentrated wind magic and a flying kick had ambushed
her.

Reflexively, Alexa showered down rock pillars onto what had attacked
her.

But that something dodged Alexa’s magic at a speed difficult to track
with the naked eye and repositioned itself.

*Grumble–!*

Alexa created a boulder using \[Rock Generation\] to support her body
and stop rolling.

Her narrowed eyes turned to the man who had attacked her. His entire
body was enveloped in wind mana. His annoying blond hair and the hems of
his uniform and cape all fluttered gently in the wind.

What wizard in this world would have thought of fighting at close ranges
at the beginning of the fight? Alexa could not understand his unexpected
antics.

Not only that, but the speed he had displayed was remarkable, seemingly
becoming one with the wind.

“Ag, rah… Didn’t that hurt…!”

…However, it was pretty pitiful to see him clutch his shin in pain after
he had been the one to attack.

The method Tristan had developed to face wizards stronger than him.

It was to use his wind magic to accelerate his movement drastically and
use that speed to overwhelm the enemy with physical attacks.

That was similar to how Isaac fought. He, after all, had always
attempted to fight at close quarters even though he was in the Magic
Department.

No matter how cheeky the man was, he had to acknowledge his wit and
skills.

In addition, the way he used the wind mana explosion to increase the
power of his attack had been inspired by how Isaac had used \[Frost
Explosion\] in close combat.

Though his hits only met their target four out of the ten times he used
them due to absurd difficulty in controlling himself at high speeds, he
was luckily able to succeed on his first attempt.

It was an ineffective way of fighting for a wizard. But this could also
be the most effective when specific criteria were met, like his current
situation.

“Ha! Was that all it took to make you fall? You’re a total weakling, I
see!”

And that criterion was that the opponent did not have high physical
abilities, just like his underclassman over there.

To reach this level, he had emptied his stomach many times and had shed
countless droplets of sweat amid severe convulsions and intense
discomfort.

And finally, he could use it in a real battle. Tristan was incredibly
excited.

“…Grgh.”

Alexa clenched her teeth. A vein popped on her forehead. Tristan’s
taunts had been effective.

Shakily standing back up, a hand clasped over the side of her stomach
that Tristan had kicked, she glared at her blond-haired upperclassmen.

If she hadn’t had \[Basic Protection Magic\] cast around her, she would
have coughed up blood. Fury flooded over her like an avalanche.

“So, annoying…!”

Alexa shouted irritatingly. But because of her shy personality, the
amplification of her shout was minimal.

Once again, the magic circles around her spewed out seven more rock
pillars. \[Rock Avalanche\]. The attack crashed towards Tristan at a
frightening speed.

But their difference in speed was clear. Tristan disappeared within a
split second.

At a speed Alexa could not track, he dodged \[Rock Avalanche\] and
pounced on her.

「Rock Wall (Rock Element, ★4)」

*Ruuumble—!*

Alexa pulled up a wall of rock and surrounded herself with it.

Afterward, \[Rock Avalanche\] continued to rain down on him, but Tristan
flew freely through the air and leisurely dodged the rock attacks.

“You’re slower than a snail. I could dodge those in the middle of a
nap!”

Tristan bellowed loudly, taunting the girl, and concentrated his attacks
on one point of the \[Rock Wall\] protecting Alexa.

Wind spells \[Wind Sword\] and \[Gale Fang\]. Punches and kicks imbued
with wind mana. Even as Alexa’s \[Rock Wall\] was restored as soon as it
was damaged, Tristan did not stop his barrage of attacks.

His leg broke. Blood spewed from his mouth. His body’s physical
capabilities were overloaded. However, Tristan did not stop and
continued his fierce battle with Alexa.

Faster, even faster.

Tristan’s attacks progressively increased in speed.

“You little…! You little gnat…!”

Beneath the rock, Alexa grabbed her dark brown hair with one hand and
trembled in severe irritation.

Just then.

*Kraghak—!*

“…What?!”

Part of \[Rock Wall\] collapsed, and a strong gust of wind penetrated
that gap.

Alexa couldn’t believe it. Tristan’s attack speed had surpassed Alexa’s
regeneration speed and pierced through her defenses.

Tristan’s hand shot through the gap in the \[Rock Wall\] and grabbed
onto Alexa’s jacket.

And using the moment when Alexa’s mana was shaken, Tristan used \[Gale
Fang\], a series of wind attacks sharp like a wolf’s fang to shatter
\[Rock Wall\].

*Craaaaash—–!!*

Immediately after, Tristan tried to detonate the concentration of wind
mana he had in his hand.

In Alexa’s eyes came the view of a laughing madman with blood spilling
from his ears and mouth.

An inexplicable sense of disgust swelled inside her. Alexa’s face
crumpled violently.

“Caught yo—!”

*Kbooom—-!*

Alexa’s magic was faster. A \[Rock Avalanche\] she had prepared in
advance surged up and hit Tristan, pushing him up to the ceiling.

With a loud ‘*Bang!*’ it sounded like something had exploded.

*Boom!*

The rock pillar mercilessly collided with the ceiling.

But the cyclone contained by Tristan was still hovering in the air with
incredible speed. It was clear that he had run away before the final
collision.

“Kehahah!! Not bad!!”

***Crazy bastard.***

Those were the only words she could use to describe him.

Even after all his bones had been crushed by \[Rock Avalanche\], he was
spilling a dangerous amount of blood; Tristan continued to laugh
manically, seeming almost hysteric.

***Why was it? The man’s laughter began scaring her.***

Even though it was clear he was weaker than her.

“…Argh!”

*Thump, thump!*

Alexa once again used \[Rock Wall\] to surround herself, then used rock
pillars to block off all entrances.

Then, a light brown rock magic circle appeared on the ceiling. It was a
formidable amount of mana. Tristan felt a chill run through his entire
body.

What was being drawn was the magic circle of the 6-star spell, \[Meteor
Shower\].

“She’s only a first-year, yet she’s using 6-star magic…”

A laugh slipped out of Tristan’s mouth. What he was currently seeing
almost felt ridiculous.

First-years would be praised as geniuses for using 5-star magic.

Using 6-star magic already meant they were on Luce Eltania’s level.

He should have entered a passage and dodged that attack, but Alexa had
already blocked off the passages with her rocks.

Also, Alexa had already gotten rid of the rock pillars below that he
could take cover under. The light brown speckles of mana glittered in
the air as they scattered away.

Tristan took in the majestic view of the 6-star magic circle etched on
the ceiling.

Unfathomable amounts of mana poured out of it.

***You are special.***

That single sentence had changed Tristan Humphrey’s life.

However, he had not once thought of himself as special.

It was because he had been the next head of the Humphrey Family that
Father, who struggled to say even one compliment, said those words to
him out of desperation.

Tristan knew that fact very well. When he thought about it, the meaning
of ‘You are special’ might not have meant a good thing.

But just hearing it was good enough for him. To change Tristan’s life,
just those few words had been enough.

The more he trained within an ideal environment, the more Tristan
realized that he was just a lucky person born into a wealthy and
influential family.

Because of that, he thanked the Humphrey Family and vowed to become a
special person.

It was also why he had always blabbered off about being a superior,
special, and legendary being.

Even if it had all been but a mere mask.

He believed that specialness was something that one made.

That was one reason Isaac especially caught Tristan’s attention in
Märchen Academy.

Grade E mana.

A pitiful grade that showed he hadn’t even tried to use magic since
youth.

A poor commoner. Pitifully low status.

He, who should have ended there, showed no hesitation in battle, poured
his everything into training, and was now highly respected by other
students.

So, he disliked Isaac.

He was the one who had been living Tristan’s beliefs as a reality.

*Whooooooosh—!!!*

Tristan’s wind mana caused another fierce whirlwind.

He casted the 4-star defense magic, \[Wind Wall\], at maximum output.

He was the one who was going to become the most special and greatest
wizard of this academy.

He didn’t want to lose to someone like Isaac. After all, hadn’t he been
born with better conditions?

It was only natural for him to be ahead.

“Ha!”

That underclassman has likely been called a genius by the people around
her.

***Genius? What a ridiculous word.***

***He will crush them.***

“Come at me, brat!”

Soon, the magic circle on the ceiling rained light upon the labyrinth.

And countless meteors shot down like arrows.

<span id="0148_150_Joint_Practical_Evaluation_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 150: Joint Practical Evaluation (7)
===========================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation (7) ༻**

Although golden lines were engraved seamlessly in the air, they could
not dispel the fierce whirlwind.

It was impossible to know what was happening within the torrent of mana.

However….

*Whooosh…*

When the \[Meteor Shower\] stopped, as if it was an inevitable outcome,
a blond man fell emptily from the whirlwind.

*Thud.*

Tristan Humphrey collapsed on the ground, bloodied, like a cold corpse.

His wind ceased. Alexa, who was already sweating coldly, heaved a deep
sigh. She released her \[Rock Wall\], and took in the sight of him
collapsed on the ground.

“…”

He was an annoying and irritating man. Alexa clicked her tongue and
moved on.

As she passed by Tristan,

*Whoooooosh───!!*

“…!!”

Suddenly, as if waiting for that split moment, a fierce light green wind
arose.

*Rumble!!*

“Ugh!”

A series of wind spells struck Alexa.

The moment she felt mana, she instinctively created a wall of rocks
around her body to block the wind, but…

As she heard the laugh, ‘Kahaha!’ Alexa’s complexion turned pale with
fright, and a chilling shiver ran down her spine.

Soon, piercing through the fierce whirlwind, the blond man thrust his
blood-covered face towards Alexa.

“Is that all you’ve got?!!”

“Aaaaaah!!”

Unable to bear that terrifying face, Alexa screamed out loud.

“Kha…!”

However, Tristan’s wind quickly died down, as he could no longer
maintain consciousness.

He collapsed right there with a content smile on his face.

Alexa bit her lip hard, exclaiming, ‘Hmph!’ Her eyes were wide open,
filled with anger.

As if she were about to kill a disgusting cockroach, she raised her arm
high, ready to unleash her rock magic to finish off the unconscious man.

Just then, someone from behind caught Alexa’s raised arm with a left
hand wearing a black glove.

“Alexa.”

“…!”

A black-haired, bespectacled male student.

As his deep voice resonated, Alexa’s eyes wavered.

“What are you doing? Didn’t the Queen specifically tell you to not do
anything conspicuous?”

His voice was as cold as frost and laced with lethal intent.

Alexa lowered her arm without resistance and steadied her emotions with
a deep breath.

“Haa… I’m sorry.”

For Alexa, who had lived as she pleased, common sense was not something
well-established.

Even in an exam hall, it wasn’t strange for her to break through blocked
walls just because she didn’t want to take a detour.

She didn’t properly understand what was sensible and what wasn’t.

Therefore, even though she had been warned against doing certain things
by other paladins and trump soldiers…

In the joint practical evaluation, she had acted recklessly because she
couldn’t do otherwise.

It was only due to the male student’s persuasion, that she realized her
mistake.

Surely she would be scolded. She must have caused trouble for Queen
Alice.

The male student lifted his glasses with his left hand, adorned by a
black glove. It was meant to cover the spade emblem on the back of his
hand.

He was the Spade Paladin, the foremost and the strongest among them.

Alexa’s gaze rested again on the unconscious Tristan, who still had a
faint smile on his face.

…Even though she had won, it didn’t feel like a victory. Despite still
having mana left, she felt utterly drained.

Alexa clutched her side. As the battle ended, a severe pain surged, and
she bit her lip hard.

Soon, several exam proctors flew in from the corridor and surrounded
Alexa.

She secretly handed a compass to the Spade male student, then followed
the proctors without any resistance. The situation resolved more easily
than expected for an emergency, leaving the proctors in a state of
bewilderment.

The Spade male student was thanked for stopping Alexa.

After being declared disqualified, the unconscious Tristan received
emergency treatment with healing magic and was carried away on a
stretcher.

“…”

The Spade male student looked at the compass he had received from Alexa.

It was pointing towards Eltra Coast.

He began walking in the direction indicated by the compass.

At a certain location within Octovus Hall,

Märchen Academy’s first-year top seat in the Magic Department, the girl
with jet black hair, Priestess Miya, was wandering alone in the Octovus
Hall.

She had decided to act independently, after sensing that all her team
members were utterly useless.

Being the top seat, her team members, selected for balance, were all at
the lower levels of Classes C and D.

To Miya, they were nothing but disgusting insects.

\[Even so, it might be better to cooperate… Shouldn’t you consider the
teamwork score?\]

Her Nine-tailed Fox familiar, Mae, hiding in Miya’s index fingernail,
tended to express her opinions timidly despite her imposing tone.

This was because she felt guilty if she misspoke and upset someone.

“This exam is fundamentally flawed.”

*Whoosh!*

Miya crossed the dark corridor, burning the demonic illusions with her
fire magic as she moved from place to place.

The death throes of the demonic illusions were grating to her ears, so
she repeatedly blasted them with her fire magic, turning them into ash.

“I can’t come along with the lowest insects. I need to find a Predator
instead.”

\[A Predator?\]

“My Prince might be a Predator, you know. Ah, how I miss him\~.”

Whenever she uttered, ‘My Prince,’ Miya’s voice was filled with
affection.

The Nine-tailed Fox heaved a deep sigh.

“…Haa. What now?”

Suddenly, Miya’s expression hardened, and her voice grew solemn.

Miya frowned as she detected the demonic illusion hiding in the midst of
darkness, waiting for a surprise attack.

She conjured a red flame in her right hand, preparing to attack.

It was then.

“…!!”

A tremendous amount of mana brushed past her skin like the wind.

Miya, with a startled face, turned her head towards the direction from
where she felt the mana.

***Could it be my Prince, the power of the Nameless Hero?***

…No. It was a creepy and chilling mana she had never felt before in her
life.

Miya quickly guessed its identity and smiled broadly, as if her lips
would tear.

Finally, what she had been waiting for had appeared.

“It’s a demon.”

Last year, demons frequently appeared at Märchen Academy.

Whenever demons appeared, The Nameless Hero would appear and without
fail defeat them.

That meant,

“This is when my Prince appears…!”

Miya’s eyes sparkled. She had no interest in who died or how many
perished due to the demons.

Her only desire was to court the strong figure she had affection for,
the Nameless Hero. That was her biggest reason for enrolling in Märchen
Academy.

She had already sworn her heart to him. Miya was utterly fascinated by
the tales of his heroism and strength she heard in Horan. Such a man
would be impossible to find anywhere else.

It was a joyful day. Miya waved cheerfully at the demonic illusion and
moved forward with bouncy steps like a rabbit, humming a work song from
the Land of the Fire Blossoms.

The momentarily stunned demonic illusion soon roared and lunged at her,
only to be effortlessly consumed by Miya’s flames, tinged with her
laughter.

Meanwhile,

In Octovus Hall, everyone except those with extremely low mana
perception felt it.

Everyone felt the damp and immense mana pouring in from the outside.

The narrow-eyed girl with pink hair, Saintess Bianca Anturaze, also
stopped in her tracks as she felt the immense mana while walking through
the Octovus Hall.

Even in her academy uniform, she wore a white veil on her head,
symbolizing her status as a Saintess.

Bianca’s gaze turned towards the source of the mana. Nothing was visible
due to the wall, but she knew where that direction led.

“Hehe, hehehe…”

Bianca began to giggle, her shoulders trembling.

“Have you come, evil demon?”

Saintess Bianca Anturaze.

Born with the power of the element of light, but unlike Ian Fairytale,
she was a girl who couldn’t grow her power.

Being a pure human, she had limitations in handling the power of the
element of light. However, no one in the Helize Church knew this fact.

The power of the element of light was meant to destroy demons. That was
why Bianca had a wish.

She was a Saintess born with the element of light, a gift of grace from
The Lord Manhalla. She too hoped that one day she would be able to slay
evil demons.

That was why she enrolled in Märchen Academy.

Here, demons often appeared for unknown reasons. She could encounter
them.

With her own hands, with her own weapon, she could be able to defeat the
demons!

Bianca couldn’t calm her expression. Her usually narrow eyes were wide
open, revealing pretty eyes sparkling with anticipation.

Blushing, she extended her right arm to the side. Divine power emitted a
rainbow light, and a steel mace adorned with a beautiful mana stone
materialized in her hand.

Unable to contain her excitement, she uttered, ‘Haa, haa.’

“Quickly… with this mace of justice, to pass judgment…!”

Bianca, holding the mace close, moved excitedly towards Eltra Coast.

\* \* \*

“Well done, Tristan.”

Such words came out involuntarily.

Crossing through Octovus Hall, I watched Tristan and Alexa’s fight with
\[Clairvoyance\]. Tristan, with his strong desire to win and improve,
had provided a great distraction.

He even fought better than expected against a Paladin stronger than
himself. Although I couldn’t give him a gift because he disliked me, I’d
express my gratitude in my heart.

***Thank you!***

Before I knew it, the exam bracelet had ceased to function, emitting a
‘pop’ sound.

Now, only one task remained.

\[A demon has been detected nearby.\]

With a light gesture, I dismissed the system window floating in the air.

I took a deep breath.

After steadying my emotions, I started running towards Eltra Coast.

<span id="0149_151_Abyssal_Sea_Monster_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 151: Abyssal Sea Monster (1)
====================================

**༺ Abyssal Sea Monster (1) ༻**

“What… is that…?”

One of the destinations of the joint practical evaluation, Eltra Coast

In the middle of the Eltra Sea, beneath the storm clouds and surrounded
by gloomy fog. The calm ripples flowing in from the distance suddenly
surged into violent waves.

A wicked, dark mana surged to the surface, then ascended to the sky in
spirals.

Then, the sea itself lifted upwards in the shape of a mountain.

Salty water spewed down upon the sea like a waterfall.

An unidentified figure slowly rose, revealing its massive silhouette.

Evil mana spread through the air, following the currents of the gusty
coastal winds.

The proctor broke into a cold sweat. It didn’t take long for them to
realize that what they were looking at was a demon.

They hurriedly held up their bracelet to contact the academy, but their
bracelet did not activate, perhaps due to the demon’s unique power.

The proctor could not use their mana as well. Though they could use
mana, it felt unusual at the moment.

It was clear that the demon was disturbing the mana in the area.

“Damn it…!”

They cursed to themselves with fear flooding over them. The terrors of
Elt Island and the Floating Island were resurfacing in their minds.

But they remembered their duty.

Soon, the entrances of Octovus Hall, where the joint practical
evaluation had been held, would automatically close and be sealed with a
strong barrier.

This had been done to send the students who had arrived at the
destination back into Octovus Hall in order to protect them in the case
of an emergency, such as the appearance of a demon.

At the same time, it would also prevent the students unaware of the
situation outside Octovus Hall from leaving the vicinity.

The proctor quickly scanned their surroundings.

Nobody was nearby. Thankfully, there hadn’t been any students who
arrived yet.

A gathering place was determined in advance. The proctor turned and
began running towards the gathering place.

A high tsunami wave approached them. When it came close enough, the
countless magic tools positioned on the outer perimeter of the island
were triggered simultaneously.

A transparent barrier with deep pink rose petal patterns was activated.
It was large enough to surround the entire perimeter of the island.
Created from Headmistress Elena Woodline’s mana, the barrier would last
for 20 minutes.

However, the demon’s power, \[Mana Drain\], caused the rose petal-shaped
mana to crack. It would be unable to accomplish its role as a shield.

However, the barrier managed to accomplish its role as a breakwater. The
tsunami did not pass over the barrier and sweep the academy.

After the Floating Island incident, Märchen Academy worked tirelessly to
make various preparations against the demons. They could not, after all,
depend on the Nameless Hero forever.

*Pop.*

Above the sea. The terrifyingly massive creature’s gills were flubbing
in and out next to its cheeks and neck.

Its round mouth, which covered half its face, repeatedly opened and
closed.

It was a deep blue color, with a slender body that looked similar to a
stretched human. The creature brought more terror because it resembled a
human figure.

——-\[Grwoaaaahhhhh——.\]

Its cry was similar to that of a ship’s horn.

As if calling to something, their cry stretched out.

Hearing that signal, its minions floated up to the surface with a
splash.

All sorts of bizarre marine specimens emerged to the surface. They were
all large enough to be differentiated, even at a distance.

One fish had its brain exposed for all of the world to see.

Another had its organs wrapped around its body like a spiral.

And another fish was holding a slimy net covered with eyeballs in its
mouth.

Leaving those aside, they all looked sickeningly disgusting.

The army of fish surrounded the island.

All imbued with a shadowy, vapor-like dark mana, the creatures either
began to swim or fly with wings shaped like human hands to approach
Märchen Academy.

Their thick-lipped mouths opened wide, letting out screeching laughs.

With them, the massive demon also began moving.

On the northern side of the island, at a hilltop.

Merlin Astrea, the female knight with a light-green ponytail, stood with
the other Imperial Knights as she gazed at the northern seas.

She and the imperial knights she led needed to protect this position.

The rest of the Imperial Knights and Märchen Academy’s combat line,
battle wizards from the Hegel Magic Tower in cooperation with the
academy, and the select few student volunteers with high skill all took
their positions in separate directions.

***‘Look at that vast sea. Many lives must be conceived in its depths.
Wouldn’t there be demons over there? Yes, Of course!’***

Suddenly, she remembered what Princess White had nervously chattered
about in the carriage on their way to the entrance exam.

***How coincidental.***

“You have extraordinary intuition, Princess White.”

Merlin smirked playfully. But soon after, she settled her expression and
turned her golden eyes back to the army of demons above the sea,
attempting to invade Märchen Academy.

Daughter of a Swordmaster. Vice-Commander of the 1st Zelver Imperial
Knight Division, the Fenrir Knights. Merlin Astrea.

There wasn’t any particular reason for the Imperial Knights, including
herself, to have come to Märchen Academy.

It was so that no matter what dangers came upon them.

***They will protect the Princess.***

***They will protect the people.***

***They will protect the empire.***

Investigating the identity of the Nameless Hero and volunteering to
become an academy proctor were all, in the end, to protect someone.

That duty itself was what made the Imperial Knights themselves.

Taking in a deep breath, Merlin shouted aloud.

“Listen closely! We are a fort! The enemy is the demons! We will protect
the northern region of this island!”

The magic knights and archers attacked the enemy with ranged attacks.

The rest of the knights then took down the remaining enemies.

That was their basic strategy when defending against invaders.

“Let us fight, Knights of Zelver!”

Merlin shouted to the troops in a determined voice.

She unsheathed her sword from its place on her belt.

Following her lead, the knights positioned behind her took out their
weapons.

They charged towards the enemy.

Meanwhile. On the roof of a building facing the Arkins Sea.

One female student sat on the ledge, watching the army of fish demons
charge towards Märchen Academy.

She pushed the witch hat on her head down so it wouldn’t fly off in the
coastal breeze.

She swung her dangling legs leisurely as if she felt no danger.

“This is reeeeeally boring\~.”

There were beings within this world who were considered otherworldly.

Just like the lavender-haired student on the rooftop.

Dorothy Heartnova. She heaved herself onto the railing.

Due to the frequent demon appearances last year, Märchen Academy had set
detailed procedures to follow in the case of an emergency.

Anti-Demon Defense System, she believed it was called.

It just so happened that Dorothy volunteered to help protect the
Academy.

And in the case of a mass-demon appearance like the Floating Island, she
had been positioned on the first line of defense for the western side of
the academy.

That was due to Isaac’s request.

It was difficult to estimate just how many people Dorothy alone could
replace.

In other words, Isaac had asked Dorothy to cooperate with the academy’s
faculty and help protect the academy so it would become even safer.

Many enemies were likely approaching this western region by now, but it
didn’t matter to Dorothy how many came.

Because she was confident that she could take them all.

“Well…”

Dorothy opened her right hand. A flurry of colorful stars shimmered in
and out of view.

Starlight mana. It was a unique element of mana that only those chosen
by the fairy Stella could use.

“Let’s end this quickly.”

Dorothy murmured to herself quietly.

The students who had arrived at each destination during the joint
practical evaluation followed the proctors at their location back to the
underground evacuation facility Octovus Hall.

When they had finished returning to Octovus Hall, all entrances were
closed, and a powerful barrier invented at the Hegel Magic Tower was
activated.

The academy’s faculty led the students on the surface to the underground
evacuation facility as taught in advance.

Several other faculty members also scoured the campus in case any
students were left outside.

Meanwhile, inside of Octovus Hall.

The joint practical evaluation had been stopped, but because of the
demon that had emerged from the sea, the bracelets used for the test
were now useless, making communication difficult.

So, the proctors who arrived at the gathering area followed Philip
Meltron’s directions.

Some were sent to find and evacuate the students traversing Octovus
Hall.

The others were to protect the students who had gathered in the safest
area.

Since all the entrances of Octovus Hall were sealed, not a single
student should have left its perimeters unless they bothered to break
the barrier.

Moreover, the barrier’s exceptional durability made it difficult for
most students to break it open.

However, Märchen Academy could not predict every single situation.

“Is this the place?”

The Spade Paladin, a black-haired male student with glasses, arrived at
the entrance to the Eltra Sea with the compass he had followed.

Only the luminescent lamps nearby lit up the surrounding area. At the
top was the tightly shut entrance. All he had to do now was climb the
ladder.

However, there was a barrier set at the entrance. Its durability was
remarkable.

The Spade Paladin scowled, then concentrated ice mana into his right
hand.

Then he set off his spell at the entrance.

「Frost Explosion (Ice Element, ★5)」

*Baaaang——!!!*

The glacial explosion broke the barrier with a single blow.

The ability of the demon that appeared on the Eltra Sea, \[Mana Drain\],
did disrupt his mana, but his mana mastery was enough to break the
barrier and pop off the entrance door.

And so, the Spade Paladin climbed up the ladder and slipped out.

Just when he arrived at the oceanic breeze.

“…!!”

Everyone in Märchen Academy felt an immense presence.

Priestess Miya and Saintess Bianca, who had been wandering through
Octovus Hall, felt it.

The Spade Paladin, who had just come to the surface, felt it.

Dorothy, the Imperial Knights, and the other members out to fight also
felt it.

Their bodies were overwhelmed by immeasurable fear that cried from
within. The density of the mana they felt was beyond what one could
comprehend.

They only sensed the mana, but it was enough to make them feel like they
were about to be swallowed by an unidentifiable monster.

*Stch-ch-ch-ch-chk—-!!!!*

At the same time, the eastern side of the Eltra Sea, starting from the
Eltra Coast, began to freeze at an alarming rate.

The 6-star ice spell, \[Frost Wave\].

The vicious waves froze mid-motion, and the Eltra Sea froze over into a
single large field of ice.

The fish demons swimming towards the island had been frozen to the core,
seemingly stopped in time.

The large demon with a human figure staggered, unable to move freely.

The flying demons coughed noisily in pain, with their movements slowed
by the fierce cold.

Then, ice mana began forming in the middle of the air and took the form
of a massive dragon.

——-\[Graaaaahhhh—-!!!\]

A white dragon spread its lustrous wings, releasing a powerful gust of
ice magic.

The magic beast soared into the sky and boasted its might to the world,
then roared ferociously at the hideous demon standing out at sea.

A man stood on the back of the white dragon. He had a chilly, pale blue
aura emanating from his body.

A muscular man over 2 meters tall. His deep blue wizard robe could
barely contain the muscles underneath, almost at the brink of bursting.
Under the hood that covered his head was a face darker than the night
and two red glowing eyes.

Many people on the surface witnessed that scene.

Most people were left in a daze, mesmerized by his unimaginable mana.

***Who wouldn’t know who that man is?***

***The man who single-handedly defeated the Floating Island.***

***The mysterious archwizard whose reputation had spread throughout the
entire world.***

The Nameless Hero. ***He*** had come.

The Spade Paladin narrowed his eyes and fixed his glasses.

He had just exited the entrance and was still crouched on the ground.

He quietly glared at the white dragon flying towards the massive demon
and the Nameless Hero standing on its back.

“…”

Only after he had felt the man’s mana himself did he realize.

Why the Queen hadn’t been able to act all this time.

Why, even if all four Paladins fought together, they could not defeat
him.

No matter what he had initially imagined, that man’s mana had exceeded
his expectations.

He seemed like a transcendent being on a different level, making him
question whether they were the same species.

The Spade Paladin stood up and watched that grandeur.

That man was the archwizard they had to take down.

“Black Monster…”

Inside of Octovus Hall, Priestess Miya and Saintess Bianca were still
finding their way out to the Eltra Coast.

On top of the eastern seas, The Nameless Hero and the army of demons
charged at one another.

Chapter 152: Abyssal Sea Monster (2)
====================================

**༺ Abyssal Sea Monster (2) ༻**

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 7, Chapter 3, The Abyssal Sea Monster」.

In the joint practical evaluation, if the player survived for a certain
amount of time, a demon sleeping in the deep sea in the form of dark
mana awakened, which was the beginning of Act 7, Chapter 3.

Ian Fairytale, who was a Predator in the exam, headed to Eltra Sea where
the Abyssal Sea Monster had appeared. As a bearer of the light element,
he felt it was his personal mission to defeat the demon. A sense of
justice to protect people also played a role.

However, in this world, Ian couldn’t become a Predator like in the
original scenario because I took first place in Class B, pushing him
out.

Anyway, since the Abyssal Sea Monster could be confronted without the
power of the light element, it didn’t matter whether Ian was here or
not.

The powerful mana of the Abyssal Sea Monster swallowed the surrounding
mana, causing chaos like a TV with signal interference and noise.

It was the effect of the passive skill \[Mana Drain\], a skill that
could only absorb mana weaker than its own. For reference, Ian, with the
light element, was immune to such a power.

Anyway, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, once Ian reached the Eltra coast,

The Abyssal Sea Monster’s minion and mid-boss, the Abyssal Queen, flew
in like a bullet and activated the effect of the ‘Ring of the Abyssal
Queen’.

A more powerful skill than \[Mana Drain\], the Abyssal Sea Monster’s
passive skill, was \[Mana Leech\].

It was an ability to suck the mana and life force of a desired target,
and it could only be used against those weaker than the ring wearer.

The range of effect was much more limited compared to \[Mana Drain\], so
only those on the Eltra coast suffered its effects.

As a result, the exam proctors and first-year students who reached Eltra
coast had their mana and stamina sucked away in an instant.

The ring’s power activated in proportion to how much it devoured. Even
in that instance, Ian, being of light element, was immune to \[Mana
Leech\].

The mission of the abyssal sea demons was to defeat Ian Fairytale.

To fulfill that mission, the Abyssal Queen absorbed the activated ring
into her body, gaining even greater power.

Originally, the scenario was that Ian, angered by the sight of the
exhausted first-year students, would fight against the Abyssal Queen.

‘And the hidden condition.’

If all first-year students heading to Eltra Coast in the joint practical
evaluation were successfully stopped, a new event cutscene occurred.

When the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared and the proctors confirmed that no
one had come to Eltra Coast, they immediately retreated to the gathering
place, missing Ian.

In the final scene of the cutscene, Ian began his confrontation with the
Abyssal Sea Monster and the Abyssal Queen alone. He defended against the
enemies like in a defense game, while also delivering long-range attacks
using his light element.

‘It was a reckless act.’

However, it was also a brave act.

At that time, there was no one at Eltra Coast for the Abyssal Queen to
absorb mana from with her ring.

Therefore, if the player defeated the Abyssal Queen before
reinforcements arrived, they could obtain the Ring of the Abyssal Queen,
which still hadn’t been absorbed by the demon, as loot.

Before the exit leading to Eltra Coast was sealed, I used
\[Clairvoyance\] to confirm that the proctors were leaving for the
gathering place and then slipped out of Octovus Hall.

Paladins, the Saintess, the Priestess, and the like were also rushing
towards Eltra Coast, but now it didn’t matter.

I flew over the vast ice on the mythical creature, Frost Dragon Hilde.
Eltra Sea had been frozen wide, creating a landscape as if a new island
made of ice had appeared.

And the giant demon hesitated because of the sea I had frozen.

\[Igpus the Enlightened\] **Lv:** 175

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Water

**Danger:** Supreme

**Psychology:** \[Sees you as a threat.\]

The Leviathan of demons, Igpus the Enlightened, glared at me with wide
eyes. It was as tall as the Devil Pillar, but that was no surprise to
me.

Having defeated even The Floating Island, sizes like that now seem
merely quaint to me.

Fish demons with wings shaped like human hands fluttered to block my
path in defense of their Lord.

They launched joint spells, combining dark and water mana, however…

*Whoooosh─────!!*

4-star ice magic \[Frostfire\].

A frigid flame, formed from ice mana, enveloped the area and froze the
dark water magic. The fish demons, frozen to their very bones, plummeted
helplessly.

As a Demon-Limited Hunter, it was simply a matter of using brute force
to suppress them. Even contemplating how to deal with them was a luxury.

Suddenly, the chest of the Abyssal Sea Monster demon Igpus turned slimy
and viscous. A female demon then burst through his sticky chest.

It was the mid-boss and Abyssal Queen, ‘Mezilla the Deluge’

\[Mezilla the Deluge\] **Lv:** 140

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Water

**Danger:** High

**Psychology:** \[Wants to dissolve you.\]

Each strand of hair resembled the leg of an octopus, wriggling
unpleasantly as if they were worms. It was like an octopus version of
Medusa from Greek mythology, who originally had snakes for her hair.

Thick lips covered half of her face. Her completely round mouth opened
wide, revealing sharply packed teeth to my sight.

The appearance was disgustingly abhorrent, almost making me feel sorry
for the Medusa comparison.

────────\[Gwaaaaaaah─────!!!\]

Wearing a Magic Cloak of Disguise – Berserker, a roar automatically
bursted out of my mouth.

Even though I wasn’t actually yelling, my emotional state revealed the
threatening demeanor of a berserker warrior.

As if reacting to mine, Mezilla let out a bizarre, twisted scream that
crumpled her face which also extended her tentacle hair.

At incredible speeds, the tentacles slicing through the air were each
engulfed in a grand swirl of mana, where dark and water mana merged into
dark blue waves

If touched, it would dissolve my body as if hit by hydrochloric acid.

I condensed ice mana in my hand and swung my arm roughly, detonating the
mana.

*Kwaaaaaaaah─────!!*

5-star ice magic \[Frost Explosion\]. With a loud boom, a shockwave of
ice magic spread out in an instant.

Due to the impact, the tentacles extending from Mezilla exploded, and
even the demon’s body was shattered by the shock. It was because
everything had rapidly frozen.

Following that, an ice boulder spread instantly along the remaining
tentacles, encasing both the chest of Igpus the Enlightened and Mezilla
in ice.

────────\[Groooaaaa────.\]

Igpus the Enlightened let out a ghastly scream in cold agony.

Upon releasing the ice boulder, the disintegrating body of Mezilla,
amidst the scattering pale blue dust, caught my eye. Her body parts
forlornly fell onto the ice.

I kicked off Hilde, leaping towards Mezilla, and grabbed onto the gills
in the chest of Igpus the Enlightened.

Mezilla, drooping lifelessly, then turned into grey dust and vanished
into nothing.

As something small and sparkling was about to fall from the spot, I
quickly snatched it.

A resplendent black ring adorned with a dark blue mana stone.

It was the ‘Ring of the Abyssal Queen’.

\[Congratulations! You’ve defeated the demon \[Mezilla the Deluge (Lv
140)\] and gained EXP!\] \[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 111!\]
\[You have gained 4 stat points due to the effects of the unique trait
\[Rapid Growth\]!\] \[You have obtained the loot \[Ring of the Abyssal
Queen\[!\]

‘One task completed.’

Now, only the giant abyssal sea monster demon, Igpus the Enlightened,
remained.

It twisted its head unnaturally to look down at me. Its enormous head
casted a wide shadow.

The heavy and damp dark mana settled down. It opened its round mouth and
deployed several black wave magic circles, each 20 meters in diameter.

It spat out goo-like purple saliva.

While holding onto its chest gills and looking at the scene, I condensed
ice mana in my right hand.

The formula for the 5-star magic \[Frost Explosion\] floated above.

‘Hilde.’

When I conveyed my thoughts to my familiar, Hilde,

She roared threateningly and deployed a pale blue magic circle towards
Igpus.

───────\[\[Gwoooooo─────.\]

───────\[Gwaaaaaah!!\]

Now, at that moment, Igpus’s and my Berserker roars collided.

\* \* \*

To the South. Kaya Astrea, the second-year second seat of the Magic
Department, was assigned the role of a Predator during the joint
practical evaluation.

As soon as she sensed the Abyssal Sea Monster’s mana, she exited Octovus
Hall and flew towards the south of the island.

While fighting the incoming army of fish demons, she simultaneously
healed the combat troops using plant magic.

It was exactly as pre-arranged with Isaac. Anticipating the defense
system of Märchen Academy against the demons, he instructed Kaya to go
south and defend the academy in case of a demon appearance.

The combat troops fighting the demon forces admired Kaya.

Surrounded by wind and plant mana, her appearance with her light green
twin tails and fluttering uniform and cape resembled a holy fairy.

The reason she was called the Wizard of the Emerald Fairy was
self-explanatory.

To the West. In the direction of the Arkins Sea, a massacre was
happening with the sound of clear ringing.

Waves of starlight covered the sea, and brilliant beams of starlight
ruthlessly pierced the sky and the sea.

Tremendous mana created a swarm of rainbow-colored stars, mercilessly
annihilating the fish demons.

At its center…

A third-year female student of the Magic Department, Dorothy Heartnova,
with lavender hair and a witch’s hat, floated among the numerous stars.

She had a carefree expression.

To the North. Dazzling sword energy and various elemental magics were
rampant.

To demons, even an inch of approach wasn’t allowed. The Imperial Knights
skillfully countered the demons’ magic, securely defending the north.

And to the East, towards the Eltra Sea.

“Sigh…”

The top seat of the first-years of the Magic Department, a girl with
jet-black hair, Priestess Miya, exited through Octovus Hall leading to
Eltra Coast.

Since the exit was somehow shattered, it was very easy to get out.

“This is…”

Miya couldn’t help but laugh upon seeing remnants of ice mana on the
broken door lying about.

*Kaboom───!!*

The sound of magic clashing. The roar of monsters.

Looking up, she saw a giant figure confronting a massive demon on Eltra
Sea, now turned into an ice sheet, alongside a mysterious white dragon.

At that moment, Miya’s eyes sparkled like shooting stars, and her face
filled with excitement. Her heart raced uncontrollably.

“It must be…!!!”

Miya ran towards the sandy beach.

A cold wind blew. Miya conjured a light flame under her feet to prevent
herself from falling on the frozen sandy beach.

In front of the icy sea, Miya gazed at the man she had been searching
for and exclaimed in a moved voice.

She was certain.

The person who broke the entrance of Octovus Hall. The one who froze the
sea. The one confronting that bizarre demon.

Immense mana that felt like it could crush you even from afar!

He was the protagonist of the heroic tale that captivated Miya. He was
undoubtedly the Nameless Hero.

“My Prince…!”

The sight of the Nameless Hero fighting pounded Miya’s heart like a
drum.

Her mouth gaped open in awe.

Near the Eltra Coast sandy beach, behind a black rock, the Spade Paladin
secretly observed the situation.

Soon, Saintess Bianca also emerged from the exit. She caught her breath
upon witnessing the Nameless Hero fighting in the Eltra Sea.

His roar and coldness spread fiercely in all directions.

The giant humanoid demon poured dark and water spells towards the
Nameless Hero, but…

…The Hero, along with the white dragon presumed to be his familiar,
unleashed vast ice spells, neutralizing everything, freezing, and
shattering the enemy repeatedly.

Each time the Hero swung his fist, the air vibrated, and a fierce wind
pressure surged.

It was a one-sided slaughter.

The massive, powerful demon was helpless against the overwhelming force.

Eventually, the Nameless Hero ruthlessly shattered and tore apart the
demon frozen by the cold.

*Graaaaaaaaah───────!!!*

\[Frost Explosion\]. The demon’s massive body shattered, and frozen
chunks of dark blue flesh scattered in pieces.

The Nameless Hero roared with a sound like a monster’s cry.

Priestess Miya clutched her chest and after she witnessed the brutal
fighting style, she sighed deeply,

“Haaa…”

His appearance was indeed the perfect ideal she had always dreamt of.

She had never felt her heart tremble so much in her life.

Her mind was becoming all fuzzy.

It felt as if she was born to meet him.

This emotion must be love. Surely, it was love.

On the other hand, Saintess Bianca was expressionless. Even the area
around her eyes seemed shadowed. No one could know what she was
thinking.

Soon, the shattered body of the demon turned into grey dust and
scattered in the snowstorm.

As if waiting for that moment, the white dragon raised a silver wind
containing frost, \[Frostwind\].

“…!”

\[Frostwind\] spread out fiercely, covering the Eltra Coast. Miya
protected herself with a shield of flickering red flames, and Saintess
Bianca covered her face with her arms.

It was mana as cold as the chill of midwinter. It didn’t seem to be
conjured to harm anyone; more likely, it was simply a smokescreen of
sorts.

And so.

In the swirling whirl of frost, the Nameless Hero, diminishing even his
mighty mana, faded away.

“Haa. To finally meet you, I’m so moved… My Prince…”

Inside the flame shield, Miya clasped her hands over her heart as if
praying, then closed her eyes, immersed in the aftermath.

She wanted to etch the image of the Nameless Hero fighting more vividly
into her memory.

“…”

Bianca silently sheathed her mace, turned her back, and walked away.

“Haa…”

The Spade Paladin furrowed his brows and let out a light sigh.

“To eliminate… someone like him…”

***Enemy. The Nameless Hero.***

Alice called him a ‘disruptor’, but to call him just that… he was
unbelievably strong.

The people of Märchen Academy who had witnessed the Nameless Hero’s
fight were left in awe. It was as if silence had fallen over the entire
island.

Most people had only ever heard stories about the Nameless Hero using
world-ending magic, or single-handedly defeating The Floating Island.

There were even those who proposed conspiracy theories that he was a
fictional character.

But today, people truly realized…

…The Nameless Hero was real, and his strength had reached an
unprecedented level.

And the fact that Märchen Academy was being protected by such a
formidable archwizard…

…Was clearly understood today.

\* \* \*

“Enough. Let’s escape, Hilde!”

\[I shall show you the escaping skills we have practiced. It is a race,
Master!\]

***She too must’ve adapted. It’s reassuring.***

The ice underfoot was solid. Very good.

The reason for making this was not for anything else but to escape.

\[Frostwind\] was strongly blown just before \[Hunter\] was deactivated,
so its duration should be comfortably long.

There was no need to worry about finding the way. I had
\[Clairvoyance\]. Just in case, I also had a compass taken from a
first-year student during the joint practical evaluation in my pocket.

The distance to Märchen Academy was quite far, but my stamina was
enough, so there was nothing to worry about.

I still had some leftover mana, so I could maintain the summoned state
of the baby dragon form of Hilde for quite a while. She was there to
raise \[Frostwind\] at any time in case of emergency.

\[Frostwind\], being treated as my magic, didn’t particularly feel
bothersome. I was probably the most free in this wind.

Hilde and I cut through the raging cold and ran at full speed.

It was the same ending as always.

Chapter 153: Joint Practical Evaluation — Interlude (1)
=======================================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation – Interlude (1) ༻**

“…Heeya!”

The female student with short red hair and heart-shaped hair accessory,
Shera Hectorica, woke up with a strange cry.

An unfamiliar ceiling. Was she lying in a bed?

She scanned her surroundings. Other students were lying in a bed similar
to hers.

This place seemed to be a temporary medical facility within Octovus
Hall.

Shera grabbed the blanket and pulled herself up to sit. The last memory
she had was of a strong blow to her solar plexus, causing her to lose
consciousness. She rubbed the area between her chest and abdomen.

There was a bit of soreness, but it didn’t hurt that much. It looked
like the academy’s medical staff healed her while she was knocked out.

“Luce Eltania…”

She remembered a female student with rose-gold hair and a
morpho-butterfly hair accessory.

Luce Eltania, the second-year top seat of the Magic Department. The
woman whom the legendary magic beast, Thunderbird Galia, treated as its
master. Shera had lost in the battle with that woman.

Putting aside the fact that she had a disadvantage in element, she had
heard that Luce was strong, but her power was far beyond what was
expected of a student.

Of course, she likely wasn’t similar to Dorothy Heartnova, one of the
strongest individuals in the entire world. However, it was clear that
she was born with unfathomable talent.

“What about the demon?”

“They said that the Nameless Hero appeared and dealt with it. What we
felt back there must have been his mana.”

“Damn, we missed that…”

Shera’s eyes widened in shock at the students’ conversation.

A demon had appeared while she was unconscious, and the Black Monster
had defeated it…?

Humiliation washed over Shera.

“Huahh…”

Shera buried her face into the blanket. Her shoulders trembled.

Not only had she failed to carry out her mission, but she also lost to a
mere student and was knocked out.

Though she was the weakest of the four Paladins, it was an utterly
pathetic showing.

Her head remained buried in blankets for some time out of shame and
guilt.

Meanwhile. On the rooftop of Märchen Academy’s evacuation facility.

\[Meow.\]

Phantom Cat Cheshire, a purple cat magic beast with a small fedora, was
seated on the rooftop railing, feeling the wind.

The Phantom Cat grinned as it gazed at the cold silver winds blowing
above the Eltra Sea.

The Black Monster. Its strength was unparalleled.

He didn’t dare get close enough to observe it up close. It would be a
miracle for him to make it out alive instead of getting caught up in its
magic and dying. Now, the snowy storm made it hard to see what was
happening.

To begin with, it was an archwizard. It would be able to sense unused
mana as well. He would have certainly been caught if he got close. That
was also why Alice had said not to approach it hastily.

It would be, after all, a bad idea to let the enemy, who they had no
information on, know that they were watching them. It was impossible to
know what kind of harm that would lead him to face.

Facing such a superior foe, their only choice was to move carefully in
the shadows.

But that didn’t mean he had any ill feelings towards their foe. In
actuality, the Phantom Cat liked the Black Monster.

He was Alice’s familiar. The Black Monster was a disruption to her plans
and needed to be rid of. That relationship brought entertainment for the
Phantom Cat to enjoy.

\[What are you going to do, Alice? How will you achieve your goals with
that thing in your way?\]

The Phantom Cat’s mouth curled up high enough to reach his ears,
revealing his sharp, white teeth.

The Phantom Cat’s voice traveled to his owner, Alice Carroll, who was in
her office chair in the central area of the evacuation facility,
watching over the Eltra Sea.

Alice did not respond. She merely gazed out the window towards the
frozen sea and snow flurry, lost in thought.

\*\*\*

Once the Abyssal Sea Monster Demon, Igpus the Enlightened, was defeated,
the army of fish demons immediately dissipated.

It would have been shocking for those unaware of the situation to
witness the minions, who were not created from mana but were independent
beings, follow their master to death.

Demons were still a hot research topic. The researchers would likely be
excited over this new pattern of behavior.

It wasn’t that important of a problem. The fish demons had merely been
living with support from the dark mana that Igpus had shared with them.
It was something I’d read from a guidebook before.

Anyhow, the Eltra Sea demon infiltration incident ended with the help of
the Nameless Hero.

After Igpus the Enlightened had been defeated.

The barriers blocking the several dozen entrances of Octovus Hall were
automatically opened after it had been judged that the emergency was
over.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Ian returned to Octovus Hall with the
proctors who had come to help him after defeating the Abyssal Sea
Monster. Remembering that scene, I expected the barriers to be opened.

Thanks to that, I could enter a vacant entrance and pretend to have been
wandering around Octovus Hall. Then, at a reasonable time, I met with a
proctor and was led to the gathering area.

Because of \[Clairvoyance\], it was easy for me to check the routes of
the proctors and create a natural situation to run into them.

I removed the ice covering the Eltra Sea with Defrost, and \[Frostwind\]
died down on its own over time.

Due to the fact that it was an emergency evacuation facility, Octovus
Hall had a temporary medical facility. I passed through the hallway in
front of the temporary hospital room with the proctors when I heard a
familiar laugh behind me.

“Ha!”

I turned my head to look at the owner of that laugh.

“Tristan?”

His uniform was covered in blood, and bandages were wrapped around his
entire body. His leg must still be healing as he leaned on a wooden
stick. It was my golden-haired classmate, Tristan Humphrey.

My eyes boldly met Tristan’s. He had his nose high up in the air with an
arrogant smile, just like usual.

“Have you just been wandering around Octovus Hall while the demon had
been defeated?”

“Well… yeah.”

“Seeing that you are unhurt, you must have chosen only the easy fights!
What a shame! You have lost the chance to experience growth, unlike me!”

*‘Keheheh!’*

He cackled brazenly.

“Today, this body has reached a new plane! The moment is rapidly
approaching…!”

Märchen Academy had many people who were comprised entirely of the
enthusiasm to improve.

Just like the guy in front of me right now.

“…The moment I surpass you draws near, Isaac!”

With that final confident declaration, Tristan laughed like a third-rate
villain and turned around. His laughter ended with a series of coughs.

Just like that, he limped through the hallway using the wooden stick to
support himself.

At first, it was Grade E Commoner, then it was simply Commoner. Now, it
was just Isaac.

After I had become the top student in Class B, Tristan began to call me
by my name. It was his way of acknowledging that I was ahead of him.

“…I wish you all the best.”

I turned my head back and resumed walking with the proctors.

And so, as the distance between me and Tristan widened, I checked on him
with \[Clairvoyance\].

Tristan’s grinning face slowly hardened.

Then, biting down on his bottom lip, the hand holding the wooden stick
trembled.

He fought the tears threatening to slide down his bandaged cheeks and,
with his head tilted down, attempted to settle his unsteady breath.

Thanks to \[Psychological Insight\], it wasn’t hard to understand his
current state.

After seeing me, his goal, the fact that he lost to Alexa became even
more apparent in his mind.

And because of that, Tristan was currently incredibly frustrated.

“…”

I stopped using \[Clairvoyance\].

I was Tristan’s goal. So, right now, I should not watch him any longer.

Only looking at the arrogant face that laughed in front of me like a
third-rate villain was how I would show respect to him as his target for
growth.

\*\*\*

The academy’s faculty thoroughly investigated whether any students were
hurt and how much damage had been done to the academy.

Thanks to the combat troops, composed of adults, who protected the
academy, the students were fine, except those injured during the joint
practical evaluation.

As a result, there were zero casualties. There weren’t any significant
damages to the academy’s property either.

However, how much the academy’s faculty would suffer to deal with the
aftermath of this Abyssal Sea Monster incident… I gave them my deepest
condolences.

The Paladins failed to stop me. Luce had dealt with the Heart Paladin,
and Tristan stopped the Diamond Paladin. Thankfully, I hadn’t crossed
paths with the Spade or Clover Paladin.

Though I already knew it, I was reminded once again that my plans were
always prone to change.

I could not prepare counteractions because it hadn’t been in my
calculations for the Diamond Paladin, Alexa, to charge through the
walls. I had to give my thanks to Tristan for that. It would become
highly necessary to make more detailed plans going forward.

And unsurprisingly, Alexa was referred to the disciplinary committee.

She would likely be questioned about the reason for breaking the walls
of the exam site and assaulting a proctor. But that wouldn’t go far
enough to reveal that ‘Alice Carroll was the informant’.

Considering Alexa’s nature, I believe she would remain silent and be
given a harsher punishment for her lack of reflection on her actions.
Ah, maybe the fact that this was her first offense would be considered.
And Alice might step in… It’d become clear with time.

Dorothy and Kaya received certificates of commendation for their
contribution to protecting the academy.

Dorothy bragged to me that her demerit points had been reduced…
Unfortunately, that didn’t change the fact that she still had a
significant number of demerit points under her belt.

Happy that she was given a certificate, Kaya kept a broad smile on her
face for a few days. It was absolutely adorable.

Eventually, several students decided to drop out of the academy after
the demon’s appearance.

Most students decided to stay after seeing the academy’s procedure in
response to the incident and the Nameless Hero’s actions to protect the
academy.

The main reason was that they could not give up the graduation
certificate of the famous Märchen Academy.

There were other reasons aside from that, such as admiration for the
Nameless Hero. Still, for now, the certainty about their safety when a
demon made their appearance was a significant reason.

For reference, Märchen Academy was also discussing moving the location
of the academy itself due to the frequent appearance of the demons.

However, because creating a facility like this academy in a short amount
of time was no easy feat, it was doubtful that the academy would move
locations, at least until the Evil God made her appearance.

Evening. In a corner of the Butterfly Garden.

I didn’t understand how a narrow, deserted path could lead to such a
vast and open view or why they designed it this way.

I sat down on top of the grass field. I had come here to sort my
thoughts.

Once the sun set, a group of fireflies slowly floated to the surface.

The cool breeze blew towards me and lightly caressed my skin before
passing by.

Now then.

‘Let’s sort this out.’

Through this joint practical evaluation and the Abyssal Sea Monster
incident, I gained a lot of EXP and the Ring of the Abyssal Queen.

My level increased by a total of 3. Due to the effects of \[Rapid
Growth\], I was able to receive a total of 12 stat points. And, by
clearing the achievement \[Abyssal King\], I received an additional 30
points of \[Water Resistance\].

I put in all 12 stat points into Vs. Human Combat Power.

◈ vs. Race Combat Power – vs. Human Combat Power (C+): 32/100 \[UP\] ◈
Elemental Resistance –Water Resistance (B+): 51/100 \[UP\]

For reference, my \[Water Resistance\] had already been a bit higher
than normal because of how much I was exposed to Luce’s water magic.

If I added the Elemental Bracelet onto this, then it would become a
pretty substantial stat. Since the Clover Paladin specialized in the
water element, I wouldn’t be out of commission over a couple of hits
anymore.

‘And then…’

Raising my head, I saw the starry night sky.

What came into my mind was White’s astral-themed pocket watch face. The
hands had been frozen.

‘It was broken.’

White’s pocket watch was a gift from her mother.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there were only minor foreshadowings about
its identity. One example was when Amy Holloway used \[Heart Color
Discernment\] and was frightened after witnessing something she mistook
as White’s heart color.

For reference, White’s heart color was mainly a comforting feeling. That
was also the reason why I could treat her kindly without hesitation.

Anyway, the watch suddenly broke after arriving in Year 2 Semester 2,
and its identity was revealed in the Year 3 Semester 1.

Once the watch’s identity was revealed, a shocking story about her
mother’s actions toward her daughter commenced. When I played ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱ for the first time, I couldn’t help but both curse
and be impressed by her insanity.

‘I’m glad I already knew about it.’

I didn’t know why the pocket watch had already stopped.

But one certain thing was that there was a possibility that the pocket
watch’s identity might be revealed earlier than in the game. After the
pocket watch was broken and a specific criterion was met, a terrible
disaster came upon the academy again.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, one needed enough power to alter even
god’s will. Like the ‘Luminous Sword’, the ultimate light element
weapon.

However, that weapon could only be obtained after Year 2 Semester 2.

The only thing I could do right now was to continue monitoring whether
that ‘specific criterion’ to bring upon the pocket watch’s terror was
met and to prepare accordingly.

For reference, destroying or throwing the pocket watch into the ocean
would bring the worst results. It would be best for White to hold onto
the pocket watch like usual.

‘And next…’

I raised my head and lifted up the Ring of the Abyssal Queen to reflect
the moonlight.

It was a ring with a navy blue magic stone embedded into it.

***That’s one nice-looking ring.***

Not only would this ring amplify the power of Luce’s water and lightning
mana, but the element’s colors would also deepen. Additionally, she
could use skills like \[Mana Leech\]. She would rule the battlefield
like an invincible empress.

Just like the cringe-worthy nickname Luce would later obtain, the
Empress of the Midnight Sea.

Anyhow, I needed to give this ring to Luce and somehow persuade her to
wear it on her left ring finger.

First of all, I prepared a lie about where I obtained this magic weapon.

During winter break, I pretended to leave the academy for a few days to
spar nonstop with Gormos’ golems.

I could tell her that I found it when I was outside.

If she asked how I knew the effects of the ring, then I could mention
the appraiser, Grandpa Harrison.

“Hmm.”

***Or should I give it to her playfully?***

No, that wouldn’t work. It still didn’t answer why I brought a magic
weapon ring that she needed to wear on her left ring finger.

What if I tell her, ‘I don’t know. That’s just what I was told.’ No…
that doesn’t sound right either. It was too open-ended.

***How did I give this ring to Luce in my previous life?***

Though I didn’t know if I even obtained the ring at that time, I
probably did.

Anyway, it was still a mystery how I managed to give this ring to Luce
while avoiding the Extra Bad Ending 「Bird Cage」 up to the battle with
the Evil God.

Just then, I heard footsteps behind me.

“…!”

I clutched the ring in my palm and balled it into a fist to hide it. I
didn’t want to be caught with it, just in case.

The footsteps began to come closer, and a familiar voice called out.

“Isaac, what are you doing?”

I turned my head.

A morpho butterfly hair accessory, dressed in the academy’s uniform with
rose-gold hair braided down on the side. I held my breath at her beauty.

She had her head tilted a bit to the side, a questioning expression on
her face. It was the second-year top seat of the Magic Department, Luce
Eltania.

“Luce…”

I didn’t know why she suddenly appeared, but it was nothing strange
since it happened often. Most of the time, it was because she wanted to
see me.

I had already planned on meeting her anyway.

***This is alright; it saved time.***

I should have successfully handed the ring to Luce in the past. Which
meant I might be able to find the answer in our conversation.

“What is it, Luce? Did you come to see me?”

I fixed my expression and stood up. I nudged up Ribella’s Glasses, then
smiled as casually as possible.

…But this girl’s expression looks meaningful somehow.

“Isaac.”

Luce asked me in a serious voice.

“That ring just now, what is that?”

“…”

***Right…***

***This girl had crazy eyesight.***

<span id="0152_154_Joint_Practical_Evaluation__2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 154: Joint Practical Evaluation — (2)
=============================================

**༺ Joint Practical Evaluation – (2) ༻**

Under the dim evening sky.

Luce and I sat side by side in the yard, watching the fireflies swim
through the garden under the cover of night.

It was quite a sentimental atmosphere…

“The ring, are you planning to give it to someone? Who?”

…If only it weren’t for Luce’s cold gaze and subdued voice.

I understood her cynical reaction. Luce wasn’t really sure of her own
feelings.

She often acted like a lover while calling me a friend.

But it seemed too simplistic to dismiss it as, ‘Luce not knowing how to
gauge psychological distance.’ Especially considering how far we had
already come.

She had most likely come to like me as ‘Isaac’.

And secretly thought of me as the Nameless Hero.

‘It’s just that she is too cautious to be certain.’

Because there was no confirmation.

“…Is it that one senior?”

Luce turned her head straight ahead, looking at the swarm of fireflies.

The ‘Senior’ Luce was referring to could only be Dorothy.

“Dorothy doesn’t need this.”

“She doesn’t need it?”

“It doesn’t match her own element. This is a magic weapon.”

I showed Luce the ring of the Abyssal Queen.

With the misunderstanding cleared, the ominous aura faded, and Luce’s
expression softened.

‘Ah.’ She nodded.

“It was a magic weapon…”

“Did you imagine something strange? Like an engagement ring?”

“…”

Luce pressed her lips to her knees, which she was embracing, and
remained silent.

I deliberately squinted my eyes and glared at Luce suspiciously.

“Luce…”

“No…! It’s just because we’re friends, I was just concerned as a friend.
For me… I only have you.”

Embarrassed by her own words, Luce blushed. As usual, her melodious
voice echoed sweetly.

***‘I only have you.’* *Huh…?***

It went without saying. Luce suffered from social phobia, and I was the
only exception to how she typically felt around others. I was the only
person she could open her heart to.

Luce’s braided rose-gold hair cascaded over her uniform, shimmering. It
reminded me of a few weeks ago when we playfully fiddled with each
other’s hair and giggled together.

Beyond that, a memory was reflected as if it were in a mirror, displayed
in the same composition.

The scene of Luce, dripping with blood and sitting on the ground, as we
dearly embraced each other in front of the Evil God’s army.

But in reality, she met a solitary and lonely end.

Recalling this, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.

My mouth opened slightly, and suddenly, a possibility came to mind.

“Perhaps.”

I might not have realized how simple it could be to avoid what I had
feared.

After hearing what Luce said during the Sandstone Trial, I realized why
there was no need to worry about the Extra Bad Ending 「Bird Cage」 in
the battle against the Evil God.

Luce dreamed of building a normal life with me by her side. She even
envisioned the specifics of our life together like a picture.

Living together in the same house, achieving goals together, and
eventually getting married and having children.

She wanted to build a future with me as her dear lover.

That desire must have been the restraint that stopped Luce’s impulses.
To make the future she imagined possible, she couldn’t afford to
interfere with our future through means such as confinement.

***Then, what is the catalyst that made Luce dream of such a future?***

‘How would I know that.’

***Of course, I don’t know.***

But still, thanks to that, my thoughts became clear.

I couldn’t be certain of anything, however, I knew I had to give this
ring to Luce, whom I endlessly adored.

***Then I guess I’ll have to face it.***

The shrill sound of insects in the grass.

Eventually, I broke the heavy silence that was hanging in the air.

“Luce.”

“Hmm?”

“It’s out of the blue, but you dream of being an Exalted Tower Master,
right? You’ll be incredibly busy then… Will you be by my side even
then?”

Luce looked at me with a suspecting expression, as if asking why I would
ask such a thing.

“…Of course? Even if you don’t want me to, I’ll be by your side.”

“Then lend me your left hand.”

“Huh?”

When I extended my hand, Luce showed a bewildered reaction.

She stared at my face with a puzzled expression on her face, and
eventually placed her left hand on the hand I held out to her.

It was a slender and delicate hand.

I gently held Luce’s fingers.

And slipped the Ring of the Abyssal Queen onto her left ring finger.

As if the ring existed just for Luce, it fitted perfectly on her finger.

***It suits her quite well.***

“Isaac…?”

Luce’s eyes widened in surprise.

As if her mind had gone blank, she alternated between looking at her
hand and my face, as if unable to process a rational thought.

I looked at Luce, revealing my teeth through a broad grin.

“It’s a magic weapon that will enhance your water and lightning spells,
you know? Just what you need, right? It’s said to be effective only when
worn on this finger.”

“…?”

Luce was dazed for quite a bit before she finally managed to speak.

“Did you prepare this… for me?”

Her voice trembled slightly. If someone who always had a poker face was
this shocked, it must have been quite a surprise.

“I went out last vacation, remember? I found this treasure in an antique
shop by chance. I got it cheap, so feel free to use it without worry.”

“…”

Normally, Luce would have sharply pointed out, ‘Who would fail to
recognize such a thing and sell it in an antique shop?’

Fortunately, Luce was so stunned that she seemed to have stopped
thinking and couldn’t say anything, she just stared blankly at my face.

Of course, it wouldn’t have mattered even if she had argued in a logical
manner. I was ready to skillfully change the topic with my BS Anti-Luce
speaking skills.

“It’s not just a gift. When you become an Exalted Tower Master and I
become a good wizard, and we both meet our goals… It’s a symbol of our
commitment to help each other even then.”

“…Okay.”

“So, it’s a bit cheesy but…”

I smiled slightly and extended my hand for a handshake.

“Thank you for being my friend, Luce.”

“…!”

As if she heard something completely unexpected.

Luce’s eyes widened once again.

Luce stared at my extended hand for a while, almost embarrassingly.

There was no need to read her psychology. For that brief moment, it
seemed like she was drifting through many memories.

Her face revealed a mix of complex emotions, and the expression she
finally formed was…

“…Heh.”

…A smile.

“Me too. Thank you, Isaac.”

Luce grasped my hand and met my eyes with her jewel-like eyes. She
smiled more brightly than ever before, shyly.

She blinked her eyes gently. The soft green light emitted by the
moonlight and fireflies was clearly reflected in her eyes.

Eventually, Luce stretched out her left arm towards the sky and gently
looked at her open left hand.

The ring on her left ring finger reflected the moonlight, displaying a
radiant black pearl-like color.

Luce’s subtly flushed cheeks and her profound expression came into view.

Luce’s smile, filled with pure joy, shone endlessly in the moonlight,
never fading.

‘She’s lovely.’

***I wish for Luce’s happiness.***

***And I love her happiness.***

***So, seeing her this happy naturally fills me with pride.***

We looked at each other and smiled broadly, continuing our usual trivial
chit-chat in soft voices for a while.

It was a tranquil night.

\* \* \*

\[The valiant killer whale, Bello, could not dare to interfere today…!
Well done, Isaac…!\]

\[…\]

In a corner of the Butterfly Garden.

The small killer whale familiar, Bello, and Thunderbird Galia, summoned
in a small form, were secretly watching Isaac and Luce from behind a
tree.

Isaac had slipped a ring onto Luce’s left ring finger.

As familiars, they could feel that their master, Luce’s heart, was
filled with more joy than ever before.

The Thunderbird looked at Luce with a distant gaze, his beak firmly
closed.

She had lived with shackles ever since she lost the Candy House Witch.
To make matters worse, he had succumbed to madness due to the curse of
the Evil Dragon.

Because of this, the Thunderbird often felt deep guilt.

He had stood by Luce when she crumbled, yet he couldn’t provide her with
the support she needed.

Galia resented his past powerless self, which had only caused her
sadness.

But now, Luce was smiling so brightly that it made the past seem
insignificant.

Happily, without any envy.

\[Hey, Galia. What do those tears mean?\]

\[…It’s nothing.\]

Galia was very happy with just that fact alone.

Grateful to Isaac, Galia wiped away his ears with his black wings and
held a faint smile.

Chapter 155: Ring (1)
=====================

**༺ Ring (1) ༻**

Märchen Academy did not close for even a single day.

It was unlike last year when there had been frequent shutdowns due to
countless incomprehensibly massive incidents. This year, they
established a secure and detailed system in preparation for
national-level crises.

The students who had been at Märchen Academy last year were quite
shocked at this drastic change.

Eltra Sea was temporarily prohibited from being entered.

This was because the academy’s faculty and Imperial Knights were
investigating the cause of the Abyssal Sea Monster’s appearance, even
utilizing the resources of the Magic Tower.

There were plenty of discussions among the students about the cause of
the demons’ appearances and the identity of the Nameless Hero.

In particular…

…There was a claim that the academy would gather the students of the ice
element and somehow reveal the hero’s identity.

The opposing side made the rebuttal that the Nameless Hero must have a
reason to hide their identity and that they must not bother the
archwizard who was protecting them.

The students exchanged many different thoughts about the Nameless Hero.

Some praised the Nameless Hero and admired his strength, and some were
still suspicious of this mysterious figure who may or may not be their
ally. As such, the students’ opinions began to divide in several
different directions.

The Nameless Hero quickly became the hottest issue within Märchen
Academy.

\*\*\*

Boasted to be the best academy on the entire continent, the authority of
the Headmistress matched the academy’s fame.

Headmistress Elena Woodline, a beautiful woman with her rose-red hair
put up in a bun.

Though she was in her 70s, thanks to her skill \[Immortality\], she
could maintain the appearance of her prime 20s.

Within the space called Märchen Academy, absolutely no one held more
authority than her. She was the collective owner of what one might
consider everything, whether that be beauty or power…

***…On the outside at least.***

“H-hello! Sir Magrio! Ahahah! W-what nice weather we’re having!”

In reality, she was always struggling under the name of money and power.

Bartos Hall, the focal point of the academy’s administration. In the
drawing room.

The doors opened, and a woman with a white coat draped over her
shoulders entered. It was Elena Woodline, the Headmistress of Märchen
Academy.

She brightly greeted Magrio, the Vice-Commander of the Fenrir Knights,
the 4th Order of Knights of the Empire.

Her bright voice was habitual. It creaked like a robot from her anxiety.
‘Miss Headmistress…’ Elena’s female secretary quietly muttered to
herself.

The middle-aged Vice-Commander, Magrio, lightly lifted his hand to
acknowledge Elena. Behind him were three knights standing guard, swords
sheathed at their sides.

Elena sat down across from Magrio.

“G’day, Lady Elena.”

“Would you like a drink?!”

“Herb tea.”

“Alright! Hey! Get us two cups of herbal tea!”

Headmistress Elena frantically ordered her female secretary to retrieve
the drinks. She was expressing the fact that she was anxious through her
body language and actions.

‘Please try to remain civil, Miss Headmistress…’

A quiet sigh left the female secretary’s mouth as she massaged her
temples and turned to fetch the tea. Just looking at the Headmistress’s
state gave her a headache.

“Uh, Sir Magrio? May I know the reason for this discussion…?”

“We are both short on time with the Eltra Sea incident and all, so let’s
cut to the chase.”

“O-of course!”

Elena struggled to maintain a leisurely smile but could not stop the
cold sweat from running down her forehead.

The air sank. However, she had gotten used to this environment.

Dozens of times, she had persuaded and pleaded for investors to stay for
the sake of the academy’s finances. She has worn down her knees to the
bone to establish Märchen Academy’s current defense system.

Someone had once said to smile through the pain. As a person that had
always smiled through the shittiest of realities, that was no surprising
feat for Elena.

“I wonder what it is that Sir Magrio has come all this way to personally
ask me…”

“…Why are you unable to identify the Nameless Hero?”

Elena’s head shook faintly.

“As you know, we cannot interfere with the administrative systems of
this academy according to the agreement. Also, we can only receive up to
Grade 3 confidential files of the academy. So our investigation
regarding the identity of the hero is exceedingly limited.”

Emperor Carlos Von Kairos Elfieto had given two major orders to the
Imperial Knights when they had been dispatched.

Firstly, support Märchen Academy.

Secondly, investigate the reason for the frequent appearances of the
demons.

They were warned to maintain a positive relationship with the academy
and to not pressure them.

After all, the academy was where students received academic education,
and places of education were considered sacred.

In the agreement they had first made with the academy, it was stated
that the confidential files shared with the Imperial Knights would be
limited to Grade 3.

There was the danger of leakage if more information was shared, which
would add more pressure to the academy.

Moreover, it had been confirmed that there was an ‘informant’ among
those involved with the academy’s administrations.

The academy had no choice but to be conservative in the information they
revealed in case it was leaked or any other incident happened.

“But the hero is currently assumed to be a student of Märchen Academy.
Is the academy not proficient in the discernment of its own students?”

After being dispatched, the Imperial Knights witnessed the academy’s
struggles up close and understood their situation.

However, it was difficult for them to understand how they could not find
a single lead regarding the Nameless Hero, even after investing so much
time in that endeavor.

“T-that is true… Uhm, Sir Magrio? I understand that you are also curious
about the Nameless Hero’s identity. O-of course, they must be deeply
associated with your objectives.”

Just then, the female secretary came back with the herb tea and handed
it to Elena and Magrio.

Elena’s hand trembled as it held onto the cup. She sipped the tea,
unable to sense the searing heat burning her tongue.

Elena then continued with her seared tongue.

“However, investigating the hero is part of our duty. I do not believe
that it is a matter you should be—”

“Lady Elena.”

“Y-yes…?”

“I have heard about your insight and reputation. You have worked
tirelessly to cultivate the talents who will one day lead the Empire. I
respect that deeply.”

“Ahh, yes, thank you…?”

“Which is why… no matter how much I think about it, I find it hard to
believe someone as capable as you is vacantly spending this time. So I
apologize if this comes off as rude, but I have to ask…”

Magrio’s eyes narrowed as he asked in a sharp voice.

“…Are you unable to identify them, on purpose, perhaps?”

“Ahahahahah!! How funny you are! Of course not!”

Elena laughed aloud with a flustered expression.

Magrio blinked slowly.

“It isn’t like I am unaware of your situation. The Nameless Hero is a
powerful wizard who is capable of destroying the world. They are not a
being we can easily do something to. It is understandable that you wish
to stall the search with such a person protecting the academy.”

“Wahahah! You’d make a great comedian!”

“Well, according to the contract, we cannot interfere regarding the
students.”

Magrio stroked his chin. His short, stubble beard stood out.

“Lady Elena. The reason we are here is to find the reason why demons are
appearing only in this area. It is the Emperor’s order.”

“Indeed…”

“As the Empire’s greatest academy, shouldn’t the guarantee of the
student’s safety and chance to education be fortified? If we fail, then
this academy will never be able to return to its original state. That…
is not ideal for the students, the teachers, or the Empire. The Nameless
Hero. He may be the lead to resolving this incident, perhaps the cause,
or be the key to leading us to the answer.”

Being much lighter than a sword, the teacup was held in his hand
steadily. Magrio quietly peered down at the still surface of the herb
tea.

Until now, several demons considered natural disasters appeared at
Märchen Academy.

On the surface, this might make it seem like there was a dire problem
with the academy’s defense systems that did not make it activate
properly, but from what the Imperial Knights had investigated, that
hadn’t been the problem.

Märchen Academy had a detection system that reached up high into the
skies, which utilized the mana of Aria Lilias, the Tower Master of the
Hegel Magic Tower, and Headmistress Elena. It was made in the form of a
transparent membrane invisible to the naked eye.

Thanks to it, the academy could know immediately whenever there was an
intruder.

However, most of the demons that had appeared so far hadn’t been
detected by Headmistress Elena’s detection system.

The Headmistress’s detection system was a transcendent level of magic
that had been established on its own and could not be controlled by her.

Only a periodic charge of mana was needed to sustain the detection
system, and there was no reason for the system to deactivate even when
Elena was away.

“This academy is housing a dangerous secret. Think about it. Setting
aside the massive demon that emerged from the sea, how will you explain
the demon appearances of last year? The only times the defenses were
lowered were during vacation and when supplies were imported, and do you
think the demons could have infiltrated then? They wouldn’t have just
walked in with their two feet, and baggage should have been checked
thoroughly.”

Magrio continued to speak as he stared down at the herb tea.

“Or perhaps this ‘informant’ had bribed the guards? Impossible. The
baggage was checked twice, no, thrice, and we are also aware of how many
guards there were. There were even guards using magic tools to enhance
their vision and had messengers who delivered information to them.
Bribing such a number of people is not only unreasonably costly but also
physically difficult.”

Every time a sentence left Magrio’s mouth, another droplet of cold sweat
trickled down Headmistress Elena’s face.

“Then did they infiltrate by hiding inside a magic pouch the informant
carried in? That is also quite difficult. You cannot, after all, store
living beings in items imbued with storage magic. The mana field
interferes with the storage magic. The remaining possibility would be
that these demons had been here since the beginning… However, it is
still a mystery how they managed to remain undetected up to this point.
Even if we say these demons are hidden deep within this island where we
cannot find them, there is still the question of why they have only
started to cause these incidents ‘now’.”

Without taking a single sip of his herb tea, Magrio set the cup down on
the table.

“And the Nameless Hero… They may be able to give us the answers to all
these questions.”

The Nameless Hero.

Whenever demons arrived, they also appeared right behind them, as if
they had been waiting.

As if they knew the future. As if they knew where and when these demons
would appear.

As if… They knew the truth about everything.

“I will say this once more, but isn’t the Nameless Hero suspected to be
a student of Märchen Academy? From our perspective, we cannot remove the
suspicion that the academy is purposefully refraining from finding this
person.”

“T-that is…! Something we cannot rashly decide on, nor can we
interrogate the students with brute force…!”

“I believe.”

Magrio set his elbows on his legs and rested his chin on his hands as he
glared at Elena.

The experience of fighting on countless battlefields of blood was
contained in his eyes.

“That the academy, who should maintain the most neutral position on this
situation, is favoring the Nameless Hero…”

“That’s…”

“Useless fuckin’ conversation.”

Just as Elena was hesitating to answer, a calm voice could be heard from
an unexpected location. Everyone’s gazes turned towards the windowsill,
where the voice came from.

A dense mana encompassed the parlor.

Then, a frail-looking woman hidden by a wizard’s robe stepped on the
windowsill and entered the room.

An old-fashioned cone hat was on her head, and her mahogany hair
fluttered in the wind.

It was Aria Lilias, Tower Master of the Hegel Magic Tower.

“Lady Aria…?”

Magrio’s eyes widened slightly.

“Fucked over my apprentice, then came out to take a walk but heard
something shitty.”

“Is it your hobby to eavesdrop on people…?!”

After getting down from the windowsill, Aria Lilias ignored Headmistress
Elena’s criticism and walked casually towards the sofa.

Then, as if it was completely natural to do so, she sat down next to
Elena.

“Then…”

Crossing her legs, Aria stared at Magrio with the same expressionless
face as before.

“Go ahead and yap your shit one more time. What about the Nameless
Hero?”

<span id="0154_156_Ring_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 156: Ring (2)
=====================

**༺ Ring (2) ༻**

“Kyaaaaa…! Hey, what kind of nonsense is that in front of the Imperial
Knights?”

“Elena should shut her damn mouth.”

Aria Lilias ignored the frightened Elena and stared straight at Magrio.

To others, the Headmistress of Märchen Academy and the Master of Hegel
Magic Tower seemed to have a cooperative yet close relationship.

Magrio thought it was rather good. As the Tower Master, Aria, had a
close relationship with Headmistress Elena, so she must know all the
details about the Nameless Hero.

“Indeed. It seems that the academy is deliberately not investigating the
Nameless Hero…”

“I don’t want to hear a damn thing.”

“…?”

***Who asked me to speak in the first place?***

“Listen here. The Nameless Hero is an entity that must not be fucked
with.”

“…Why is that?”

“Even if you’re backed by the Emperor’s power, it doesn’t mean fucking
squat before his overwhelming might. He is a being who can effortlessly
bring about the downfall of even this empire.”

Aria’s expression was as cold as frost.

“The Nameless Hero is protecting us. There must be a reason he hides his
identity while hunting demons. We mustn’t dare meddle with him, and
there sure as hell isn’t a justification to do so.”

“Revealing the identity of the Nameless Hero is for the sake of the
empire and for our sake as well.”

“This too is for the empire and for us. Remember that areas beyond the
control of a country revert to the logic of power… Think about who is
fucking with whom, and whether you are being arrogant.”

Aria and Magrio glared at each other.

Headmistress Elena was internally screaming, ‘Eeek…!’

Elena’s face was then covered in cold sweat.

‘What do I do about this atmosphere…’ Elena was deep in thought, looking
back and forth between Aria and Magrio. Elena’s hands wandered through
the air.

Finally, Magrio closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and stood up.

“…Further discussion seems pointless. It’s clear that we have
irreconcilable differences.”

“Agreed.”

“Aria… why are you talking as if you’re the representative of the
academy…!”

“Please continue to cooperate in the investigation of the Eltra Sea
incident. I shall take my leave now.”

“Good luck.”

“Aaagh…!”

The Imperial Knights behind Magrio clicked their tongues at Aria’s rude
manner of speaking, but Magrio paid no mind.

Soon after, the Imperial Knights left the reception room.

“Ariaaaa…”

Headmistress Elena slumped powerlessly on the sofa, her mouth agape as
if she had spaced out.

Tower Master Aria nonchalantly picked up Elena’s cup of herbal tea and
took a sip.

“Oh my…”

The female secretary, watching the scene, rested her chin on her hand
with a look of bewilderment.

Descending the stairs of Bartos Hall, one of the subordinate knights
irritably questioned Vice Commander Magrio.

“That woman, what was that all about? Her manner of speaking to you,
Vice Commander…! We are the Imperial Knights. There’s no reason for us
to be treated like that. Aren’t you being too lenient, Vice Commander?”

“It’s an Imperial Order. We must maintain a friendly relationship with
Märchen Academy. Even if it wasn’t an Imperial Order, I won’t tolerate
overt aggression in a place of learning. This also applies to Hegel
Magic Tower, with whom the academy has a close cooperative
relationship.”

“Even so, that Tower Master has lost even basic courtesy!”

“Don’t worry about her; she’s always been like that. More importantly,
those two women…”

Magrio recalled his conversation with Elena and Aria.

“They must know who the Nameless Hero is. Maybe… it wasn’t that they
were lax in their investigation, but rather there was no need to delve
deeper.”

Headmistress Elena Woodline and Tower Master Aria Lilias likely realized
who the Nameless Hero was a long time ago.

Upon further thought, it made no sense that these two still didn’t know
the identity of the Nameless Hero. They might already have figured out
the identity of the hero.

If that speculation was correct, what could be their reason for
concealing the hero’s identity?

As these questions arose, suddenly a new possibility occurred to Magrio.

“…No, it might be the opposite.”

Magrio stroked his chin.

Perhaps, on the contrary.

Headmistress Elena of the Academy and Hegel Tower Master Aria might have
been ‘concealing’ information about the Nameless Hero.

What could be the reason?

There was no need to ponder deeply.

─’Think about who is fucking with whom, and whether you are being
arrogant.’

***Fucking with the Nameless Hero is like an ant trying to take on an
elephant.***

Such a strong figure, concealing their identity while protecting the
academy, must have a significant reason for doing so.

So, rather than troubling such a being,

It would have made more sense for their goal to be strengthening the
academy’s defense system while riding on the flow of the hero protecting
the academy.

‘But…’

Elena, the Headmistress, and Aria, the Tower Master, were considered to
have foresight. Would it make sense for them to have had such an obvious
objective?

There might have been additional reasons behind their actions.

However, even if there were such reasons, Magrio had no way of knowing
what they were, and there was no confirmation to support his line of
thought.

After all, he, a mere knight, couldn’t possibly keep up with their way
of thinking.

Magrio blinked firmly and headed to the Eltra coast to join the
investigation of the Eltra Sea incident.

\*\*\*

The gaze of Luce Eltania, the top seat of the second year of the Magic
Department, remained fixed on one place.

Whether in the dorm or walking between the living quarters and
classrooms.

Even during classes, she would often look down at her hands, which were
placed on her lap.

Watching her spaced out and occasionally grinning faintly, the students
of Class A, except for Kaya in the front row, felt a chill.

“…?”

In the Class A lecture hall, during a lesson on magic beast ecology.

Seated in the back, Ciel Carnedas, a second-year student in the Magic
Department with short blue hair, through her ability to detect gossip,
guessed that Isaac must have been up to something.

Anyway, Ciel had no interest in the magic beast ecology class and wasn’t
paying any attention to the lesson.

No professor complained about it. Ciel was known for her lackadaisical
attitude, often falling asleep in class, so they were just relieved she
wasn’t asleep.

Despite this, however, her test scores were good.

Seeing her skillfully apply what she had learned and how she grew
rapidly, the professors couldn’t entirely dislike her.

But today, Ciel’s eyes were particularly bright and alert.

She couldn’t fall asleep using the magic beast ecology class as a
lullaby and cuddling her ‘everyone falls asleep pillow’ because she was
too preoccupied with Luce’s unusual behavior, which was different from
usual.

Ciel glanced at Luce, observing where she fixed her gaze.

‘A ring…?’

Finally, she saw the black ring on Luce’s left ring finger and her mouth
fell open in surprise.

Even though it was her first time seeing it, she was certain that it was
a magic weapon. But aside from that.

‘Why on the left ring finger, of all places?’

Ciel knew there must have been a significant reason for Luce wearing a
ring on her left ring finger.

This meant that the person who gave her the ring was likely Isaac.

Had he given in to his desires and gone too far?

‘No…’

Ciel shook her head.

Isaac seemed intent on making three women his own, a promising rascal
without a doubt.

If he committed so decisively to one, it would surely lead to war. All
three women who liked Isaac were powerful beings.

Of course, Isaac, regardless of status, could practically establish his
own harem kingdom without it being out of context.

He single-handedly defeated the Floating Island and last time, easily
vanquished a giant demon called the Abyssal Sea Monster and was the
youngest archwizard in history. An absolute monster without precedent.

‘But we’re students, and for some reason, he’s hiding his identity…’

Ciel, hugging her pillow tightly, pondered deeply.

‘One thing is certain. If it wasn’t a ring given by Isaac, the top seat
wouldn’t be wearing it on her left ring finger…!’

What kind of dynamics would that ring ensue among the three women? A
tremendous sense of anticipation swelled within Ciel.

Ciel turned her gaze towards the front row.

As usual, Kaya Astrea, the second seat of the Magic Department, with her
pale green twin-tailed hair, was intently focused on the professor’s
explanation.

‘Don’t lose, second seat…!’

Ciel clenched her fist and silently cheered for Kaya.

\* \* \*

“If you add the Saman stroke here, the elemental magic will spread out.
This stroke varies for each type of magic, so you need to memorize them
all. Do you understand this part?”

“…Yes.”

“No, look at the magic circle, not at me.”

“Yes…”

“…”

As usual, I was teaching Snow White at the corner of Hydrangea Garden.

In one corner, the escort knight, Merlin Astrea, had been looking over
here with crossed arms and a burdensome stare.

‘She can’t seem to concentrate.’

Lately, Snow White had been giving me meaningful glances whenever she
got the chance. Using \[Psychological Insight\], it seemed she couldn’t
forget the battle we had during the joint practical evaluation.

Well, this was an improvement. Not long after the joint practical
evaluation, she seemed frightened due to the incident where the demon
appeared.

But now, she didn’t seem to be afraid of that issue anymore.

Thanks to the academy and the Nameless Hero holding back the powerful
demon like a solid wall, she seemed to have grown to trust this place
after some contemplation.

Anyway.

‘This won’t do.’

I rolled up the parchment with the magic circle drawn on it, startling
White.

“Senior Isaac?”

“Do you have any concerns?”

“Yes?”

“If you can’t concentrate like this, there’s no reason for me to keep
you here.”

Holding the rolled-up parchment, I tapped her shoulder as I spoke.

Not overly authoritative, but with enough firmness and decisiveness in
my voice.

“If you have concerns, let’s resolve them right here and now.”

“Ah, oh… s-sorry…”

White made a troubled face, going, ‘Uh, uh…’

After being immersed in thought for a while, she finally decided to
share her concerns.

“…Senior Isaac.”

“Yeah.”

“Can I do well?”

As expected.

It was the concern I had anticipated after reading White’s psychology.

“This place is filled with monsters like Senior Isaac… Honestly, after
going through this exam, my confidence has plummeted… I just can’t feel
confident about doing well at all.”

Loss of motivation.

Well, the way to encourage someone in such a situation was simple.

After giving White some time to think, I pushed up my glasses.

I closed my eyes and let out a low sigh.

Then, opening my eyes again, I began to speak.

“I may not be that great to be called a monster, but personally, I think
you have talent.”

“Talent?”

“Do you remember what I said during the joint practical evaluation?”

White couldn’t have forgotten. The feedback I had given, along with her
feelings of fear and relief, must have been deeply embedded in her mind.

“Around this time last year, I wasn’t as good as you. That’s why I said
you were excellent.”

“Really…?”

“But I’ve come this far.”

When I was preparing for my exams, my biggest anxiety was not being sure
if I was doing well or not.

Even after going through thick textbooks several times, I wasn’t
confident about doing well in the exam until the day of the bar exam.

But, if someone had instilled in me the confidence that ‘I was doing
well,’ there could have been no greater encouragement.

‘Self-confidence.’

The confidence that one was doing well was important.

And I had the influence to instill such confidence into White.

“Even if you don’t get it yet, you’re doing well. That much I can assure
you.”

As I said this with a gentle smile, a glimmer appeared in White’s eyes.

Suddenly, I noticed Merlin, leaning against a tree, smiling subtly.

The reason for her behavior was obvious. Hearing the words of
encouragement I was offering to White, she was probably feeling proud,
thinking, ‘Ah, youth.’

“…Ehehe.”

Blushing, White smiled awkwardly and gently scratched her cheek. Her
embarrassment was blatantly visible.

“I-is that so…? Hearing you say that, I feel somewhat…”

White swayed her body gently.

She seemed quite happy.

That should do it.

“Now, let’s focus.”

“Y-yes, yes…!”

After that, White listened to my explanations without distractions and
devoted herself to training.

Pleased with her progress, I rewarded her with a mana pudding bar.

When Merlin came and took half of it, White whimpered in protest.

\*\*\*

“Nihihi, the President has arrived!”

“Ah, Senior.”

At a corner in the butterfly garden. After parting with White, I stopped
there to continue my training.

A female student with light purple hair looked up from her book and
greeted me. The cluster of starlights floating beside her was
particularly striking.

The purple brooch on her uniform ribbon indicated that she was a
third-year student.

As usual, she sat leaning against a tree. She was my favorite character,
Dorothy Heartnova.

Even the dimness of the evening sky couldn’t hide Dorothy’s loveliness.

Under her witch’s hat, her goddess-like beauty shone. It was like seeing
a halo around a beautiful or handsome celebrity.

“As the training junkie you are, you came to train right after dinner,
huh!? Aren’t you going to get a stomachache?”

“I’ll be careful. Did you have dinner, Senior?”

I asked with a smile, placing my bag next to Dorothy.

“Of course. I had chicken\~.”

“As expected of Senior, she has a love for chicken.”

“Nihihi.”

Dorothy’s favorite food was chicken. So much so that 70% of her weekly
diet consisted of chicken.

As Dorothy’s attention returned to her book, I turned my shoulder,
warming up my body, and prepared to move towards the center of the
grassy field.

“President, I saw something interesting today, you know?”

Then, Dorothy’s voice…

“Something interesting?”

“Yeah, your stalker friend had a ring on her left ring finger.”

“…”

…Preceded a heavy silence.

I abruptly stopped in my tracks.

A chilling sensation crawled up my spine. I turned my head back to look
at Dorothy again.

She was looking at me with a smile.

“Do you know who gave it to her? A student giving another student a
ring, it feels so romantic to me\~ I’m quite curious.”

The brim of her witch’s hat was tilted to one side, partially obscuring
one of her eyes.

Even though she was smiling, it didn’t feel like she was actually happy.

“You’re her friend, so you might know, who gave it to her…”

***…Intimidation.***

Somehow, I felt a stronger psychological pressure than when I was facing
the Floating Island.

<span id="0155_157_Ring_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 157: Ring (3)
=====================

**༺ Ring (3) ༻**

“So let me get this straight. The magic weapon you gained from defeating
the demon was compatible with that stalker friend, so you gave it to
her?”

“Correct.”

“And it’s only effective when worn on the left ring finger?”

“That’s also correct.”

Practicing what I had learned about elemental magic today during class,
I told Dorothy the whole story. After all, I didn’t have anything to
hide from her.

It was also easier to explain it to Dorothy as she knew the most about
my secret.

In the first place, it was impossible to lie to her when she had the
ability to read emotions.

“Luce will be helpful during the battle against the Evil God. Increasing
her strength is extremely important.”

“I know. You told me before. Well… It wasn’t that interesting of a story
then.”

Dorothy responded with indifference.

I slowly turned my eyes to the side and glimpsed at her, leaning against
the tree.

Her eyes were trained on the book opened in her lap. Starlight mana
floating around her like lights lit up her bored expression.

“…”

I didn’t really have anything more to say.

Usually, Dorothy would bring up a different topic and continue the
conversation, but there seemed to be an awkward air between us today.

That feeling when the atmosphere fell heavily. It was uncomfortable.
There hadn’t been a case before where the atmosphere was this heavy
while I was with Dorothy.

Then, Dorothy closed her book. I sensed it from the quiet ‘tuk’ sound
that came from the action.

‘What’s happening.’

I turned my head to Dorothy.

She stood up from her seat, brushed where her dress had been in contact
with the tree, and gazed at me with a playful smile.

“Hey, President, I’m going to be heading out now, bye\~.”

***Already?***

“Ah… Alright. Have a safe walk back.”

“Keep up the hard work!”

Walking away, Dorothy waved lightly to me.

“…”

It felt uncanny.

Cold sweat that I hadn’t even noticed slid down my cheek.

I stared dazedly at Dorothy’s figure fading into the distance between
the trees.

In my memory, there hadn’t been a day where Dorothy was this under the
weather.

\* \* \*

“Neugahhh…”

In Charles Hall, the dorm for top-ranked students.

With only the light from the moon shining through the window to brighten
the room, Dorothy collapsed onto her bed without changing. A strange
groan came out of her mouth.

Ella, her white cat familiar sitting on top of the shelf, smirked and
flicked her tail from side to side.

\[I’ll predict Dorothy’s current thoughts, ‘I wasn’t the only one that
President had. I let my guard down with him saying he’s my fan and
all.’\]

“Be quiet, you cat.”

\[‘Luce, she should only wear that magic weapon when necessary. Why is
she showing it off like that? And she’s staring at it all the time like
it’s going to disappear at any moment, knowing very well with her
exceptional memory that it won’t.’\]

“Guhhh…”

Dorothy couldn’t make a single retort.

“Hey, Ella.”

Dorothy turned her head to the side and peered at Ella. Her cheek was
squished onto the bed like a steamed bun.

Whenever she thought about Luce and what she saw today, her heart felt
tight. She felt horrible.

“I can understand with my head what the President said, you know? But I
feel frustrated for some reason. This is the first time I’ve felt like
this. The chicken doesn’t feel like it’s being digested either, and I
just feel irritated…”

\[Why don’t you cut down on the chicken then?\]

Ella scolded Dorothy, then barely managed to keep down her twitching
mouth.

Finally, a conflict that could excite Dorothy’s dull love life had come.

Luce Eltania. The second-year top seat of the Magic Department. She had
established a relationship with Isaac since the first year and was
undoubtedly an elegant beauty.

Now, every time Dorothy saw the ring on her left ring finger, she would
feel her stomach flip.

Thanks to that, Dorothy was now aware of her love rival, Luce, and had
gone on high alert.

Then, today, she even had a realization.

Thinking about it, Luce and Isaac tended to be bold with physical
contact. Whether that was placing their chin on each other’s shoulder
and forehead or wrapping their arms around one another…

Moreover, they sometimes acted as lovers would.

The way they treated one another as friends and peers felt quite close.

On the other hand, how did Dorothy and Isaac treat each other?

Because she was his senior, Isaac still spoke politely to Dorothy. It
meant that no matter how close they were, it wasn’t as close as he was
with Luce.

It was that sort of realization.

\[You envy Luce Eltania, don’t you?\]

“…No comment.”

Ella leaped down from the shelf and landed on the bed.

Then Ella sat in front of Dorothy’s face, looking down at her.

\[Dorothy. All Isaac did was give a magic weapon to Luce. Of course,
that would have definitely given an enormous boost of progress to their
relationship.\]

“…What’s your point?”

\[Are you just going to stay put like this?\]

“…”

Dorothy raised herself and sat with her legs crossed, then, in turn,
looked down at Ella.

“What would you do?”

\[I would make progress. You have to make Isaac look at you.\]

Ella responded coyly.

***‘Progress’, you say.***

With a short ‘hm’, Dorothy fell into deep thought.

Though she had no such thing as relationship experience, she mustered up
the courage to do some stuff to Isaac.

Recalling those memories, Dorothy straightened her back and placed her
hand on her chest. It was her confident pose, one that she always
maintained.

“I don’t think you’re aware, but I’ve done everything I can with the
President. We held hands and even kissed. We’ve already made all the
progress we can.”

\[You two kissed when Isaac was unconscious. He doesn’t even know it
happened… I didn’t know about you two holding hands, but you would have
obviously made up an excuse to do it.\]

“W-well, that is true…”

\[Not only that, but you usually don’t even go near Isaac. You have to
be bolder sometimes. Do something foxy, Dorothy.\]

“Foxy? How?”

\[For example, try putting your hand on his leg like this.\]

Ella placed her front paw on Dorothy’s thigh.

\[And you can try putting your chin on Isaac’s shoulder like Luce
Eltania.\]

Ella jumped onto Dorothy’s back and stuck her face out next to her
shoulder.

\[Then like this.\]

“Huah…!”

Ella nibbled on Dorothy’s ear with her moist lips, which reflexively
caused her to flinch and moan.

It was an electrifying sensation.

When Dorothy hurriedly turned her head away and covered her ear
protectively, Ella hopped down from her and landed back on the bed.

At some point, Dorothy’s face had turned a bright red.

\[Try acting a little ‘playful’.\]

“You…”

\[You know, just pressing those big lumps of fat against him will make
Isaac go mad.\]

“Lumps of fat?”

Ella thrust her chin towards Dorothy’s thoracic region.

Dorothy glared back at Ella with horror.

\[Let’s do this, Dorothy. Claim Isaac as yours. I like him. I wouldn’t
mind giving away Dorothy if it’s to him.\]

“I don’t know who’s supposed to be the familiar anymore…”

Ella’s bright smile was quite annoying.

But eventually, Dorothy held her chin with the tips of her fingers and
contemplated deeply.

Following Ella’s advice and using this chance to make some progress with
Isaac and make him fall for her… Didn’t sound like too bad of an idea.

\* \* \*

Daytime. In the corner of the Butterfly Garden.

Even though today was supposed to be a rest day, I planned to spend the
entire day training.

Due to the elemental magic that I had been using, a thick layer of frost
covered the grass. I didn’t need to worry about the grass since recovery
magic was casted on top of it, causing it to be fully regrown unless it
was uprooted.

I left the area I was using to train and looked into the book under the
tree’s shade.

My current goal was written in that book.

‘\[Frost Wave\] and \[Frost Glitter\].’

I planned to master both of these 6-star spells.

However, the difficulty of learning leveled spells increased
exponentially starting from 6-stars.

Of course, compared to the spike in difficulty, my learning rate had
become much faster.

At least, it was much easier than when I practiced \[Frost Explosion\],
which gave me countless bloody noses.

When \[Hunter\] was activated, my skill tree expanded instantaneously.
For reference, the skills I obtained from Frostscythe and the Obsidian
Blade were separate and unrelated to that expansion.

Anyway, the skill tree was designed with a UI of a tree with extending
roots.

Numbers unrelated to the skills were embedded inside a square block on
the right side of the screen.

When the skill tree expanded because of \[vs. Race Combat Power\], that
number was used as the reference.

Out of those, 7-star spells and 9-star spells had a difference of 10.

Since that number increased by 10 when \[Hunter\] was activated, I could
use 9-star ice spells against demons once I could use 7-star magic.

Which meant.

‘I’ll be able to use \[Cocytus\].’

\[Cocytus\] was a 9-star ice spell that transformed the surrounding area
into a frozen, desolate land of death.

Because it was world-ending magic, it wasn’t appropriate to use in the
academy.

But there would be enemies in the future who would be able to create
their own domains, like Leafa the Illusive, who used \[Fictional Hell\].
Such a spell could be a hard counter to that.

Anyhow, in the end, my objective was to roughly learn at least one
7-star spell like \[Icebolt\] or \[Eternal Snow\] during Year 2 Semester
1.

And because 6-star spells were closely and integrally associated with
7-star spells, I was first trying to master 6-star spells.

‘Anyway…’

While I was reading the book, a thought that had been worrying me
swelled up in the corner of my mind.

It was Dorothy. She seemed down yesterday.

Usually, I would have immediately ran to her side and tried to make her
smile again, but since I could roughly assume the reason for what
happened yesterday, I couldn’t bring myself to do so.

‘But I’m not sure if it’s jealousy.’

Unlike in the past, I often felt that Dorothy was now treating me like a
man.

She would show slight signs of blushing, so I couldn’t guarantee that
she had no feelings for me.

Then, was Dorothy jealous that I gave Luce a ring to wear on her left
ring finger?

I gave her an honest explanation as to why I did that.

I didn’t have anything more I could say to Dorothy. In the end, it was
how she interpreted it that was important.

‘Though, that was supposed to be the case…’

However.

I couldn’t help but feel worried because I felt that Dorothy had been
hurt.

“Haa. Dorothy…”

A sigh escaped my mouth.

Just then.

A lively voice popped up from behind my shoulder as if she had been
waiting.

“Boo!”

“Hu…!”

My shout stopped after the first breath. That was because I had
forgotten how to breathe.

My favorite character with light purple hair had stooped down next to me
and positioned her face right next to my shoulder. Even under the tree’s
shade, her beauty shone brightly.

It looked like she had been hiding behind the tree, waiting for the
right time, then popped out.

***That surprised the hell out of me…***

“Nihihi, President. Don’t forget to breathe.”

Only after Dorothy slapped my shoulder did I remember how to breathe.

“Senior…”

“I didn’t think you would think about me while alone\~ You must really
need me after all, don’t you?”

Raising both of her hands to point at me, Dorothy teased me playfully.

I only responded with narrowed eyes, complaining silently to her for
surprising me.

“What’s this book? Oh, 6-star spells! Ah, the memories!”

Dorothy sat beside me, then leaned closer towards me to read the book.

***But isn’t she a little too close?***

The alluring scent coming from Dorothy’s hair and nape tickled my nose.

“You know, I learned 6-star spells back when I was 12. Isn’t that
amazing? You can call me a genius, alright!”

“Ah, yes… That is amazing. You’re a genius, Senior.”

“Nihihi.”

Though she did seem like her usual self, like how she was boasting about
herself confidently…

‘Why is it…’

For some reason, she felt different today.

First of all, Dorothy had placed her hand on top of my thigh.

And how she set her chin on my shoulder was another thing. This was the
first time I had been this close to her after the day I defeated the
Floating Island.

It wasn’t common for her to act like this.

“If you find something hard to understand, ask me. Though I don’t have
the ice element, I’ve seen plenty enough to help!”

“Thank you. I’ll do that.”

…However, different questions came to mind after I was finally able to
concentrate on the contents of the book.

‘How can I concentrate when you’re doing this to me…?’

But I couldn’t say anything when I thought about what happened
yesterday. I guess I just had to endure it for now.

I could vaguely see Dorothy’s face at the edge of my vision. Even that
was enough to acknowledge her beauty.

…Well, because \[Learning Efficiency\] was maxed, it unexpectedly didn’t
affect my ability to read the book much. It felt like the words were
effortlessly entering my brain.

Suddenly…

“…Hup.”

Dorothy’s unexpected action caused even my maxed \[Learning Efficiency\]
to crumble.

“Euht…!”

A gentle and moist feeling suddenly slipped onto the tip of my ear.

My eyes shot open. An ecstatic pleasure raced through me like a bolt of
lightning, making my body flinch.

I swung my head to the side to stare at Dorothy, in which she then
hurriedly removed her lips from my ear and leaned away from me.

“Haa…”

A small sigh left Dorothy’s mouth.

Had she become flustered after realizing what she had done? Her face had
become a deep red.

She let out an awkward cough.

“Uh, Senior? What did you just…?”

“My teasing’s gone a little too far, didn’t it? Sorry, President…”

Avoiding my eyes, Dorothy slowly scooted away from me.

I touched the ear that she had nibbled on with her lips. A small amount
of saliva was left on my fingers.

When I looked back at Dorothy, her face was turned away from me,
attempting to hide its scarlet blush.

An uncomfortable silence existed between us.

“…”

***Really.***

***What is the matter with her today…?***

<span id="0156_158_Ring_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 158: Ring (4)
=====================

**༺ Ring (4) ༻**

Dorothy’s psychology was still unreadable.

No matter how I thought about it, guessing why she was acting like this
today was mere speculation.

First of all, I wanted to resolve the awkward atmosphere.

“Senior.”

“Hmm…”

As expected. She didn’t turn her head towards me.

Dorothy knew how to wear a smiling face like a mask, but it seemed she
was no match for shame.

I thought that telling a funny story wouldn’t get her attention and
would only serve to increase the awkwardness of this atmosphere…

‘Then.’

Assuming Dorothy liked me, there was a way to ease the mood.

***It’s bold but equally as effective.***

I put down the book beside me and approached Dorothy.

“Huh? President…? Huh?!”

I silently bit Dorothy’s earlobe with my lips.

Dorothy’s body shivered slightly.

That trembling sensation was transmitted to my lips.

When I suckled on her earlobe as if I was kissing it, a sticky sound
echoed along with a wet, ‘smack’.

For the first time, I heard Dorothy’s mouth open and close with a gasp.

Upon noticing her reaction, I detached my lips from her ear.

Dorothy quickly turned her head toward me, covering her bitten ear. Her
eyes were wide with surprise.

‘Finally, our eyes meet.’

Her face turned even brighter.

Thus, we ended up staring at each other, while she covered her ear.

I felt embarrassed as my face grew increasingly hotter. I understood
Dorothy’s reaction.

“Now, we’re even.”

I said with a chuckle to conclude this interaction.

Dorothy seemed to ponder what to say, then soon burst into a giggle.

“Nihi, President. Is this what you call, ‘revenge’?”

Finally, the atmosphere softened.

“It’s unfair if only I suffer. It feels weird, you know.”

“Yeah, indeed. It felt quite strange…”

…But somehow, it seemed the mood shifted in a slightly different way.

To be entirely honest, as a man, I liked such an atmosphere. The feeling
of being tickled inside. Simply put, I was excited.

I wanted to keep looking intently at my favorite character’s face like
this, but since it seemed like I wouldn’t be able to study at all if I
did, I decided to restrain myself.

Since I couldn’t really afford to leisurely indulge in this healing
time…

“Senior, I’m going to study, so don’t disturb me too much.”

“Okay… I won’t.”

“…”

If it were before, she might have responded with, ‘I’m going to disturb
you\~? Try to stop me if you can! Nyahaha!’

***For Dorothy, this is an unusually obedient attitude, which feels…
strangely awkward.***

It wasn’t bad. I preferred no disturbance.

Dorothy pulled out a small book from her witch hat and placed it on her
lap. It appeared to be a novel.

“…”

*Silence.*

While reading, I sneakily glanced at Dorothy.

The plan was to take one more look at Dorothy’s face and then *really*
focus on my book.

***But…***

She seemed to have been glancing at me too, as our eyes met while her
head remained fixed on her book.

She wore a sly smile.

“Not focusing, President? Do you want to see this Big Sis that much\~?”

“…I was just distracted by something.”

Satisfied, I turned my attention back to the book.

\* \* \*

“Senior Isaac and Senior Luce will probably date later, won’t they?”

At a corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

Even on a holiday, Snow White was training.

After hearing that Isaac didn’t take a single day off training unless he
fainted, she too resolved not to rest on holidays.

She called it the “Imitating Isaac Method”.

Of course, she couldn’t match the time he devoted to training. White
didn’t have the physical stamina for that.

During a break. White was sitting on a flat rock.

Suddenly, White asked Merlin, who was standing beside her, a question
about Isaac.

Something about romance. Merlin’s head snapped up and she leaned in
close.

Graceful movement. Merlin’s eyes sparkled with intense interest.

“In my opinion, it’s a definite yes.”

“Huh…?!”

Merlin answered without a moment’s hesitation. There wasn’t even a
question of why such a thing was being asked. It was because it was a
topic she liked.

White was taken aback by such an enthusiastic response.

“Hmm, seems like you like such things. Relationships. It somehow doesn’t
match your usual image…”

“It’s refreshing. Love at Princess White’s age has the power to make one
happy just by observing it. Especially between Sir Isaac and Lady Luce
Eltania, there’s a flow of feelings that I like. The thrilling sensation
just before dating…!”

“I’ve never seen Merlin this excited…”

White let out a hollow laugh.

“I wonder when Kaya will experience such a romance…”

“Oh, you mean your younger sibling? Senior Kaya Astrea.”

“Yes. I intended to greet her whenever we crossed paths, but somehow
it’s been difficult to encounter her. I can’t even enter the classroom
building.”

“Why don’t you just invite Senior Kaya over to our side? I’m fine with
it.”

“No. Like Sir Isaac, she’s very ambitious, typically focusing on
training. Since I’m also on a mission to escort Princess White, calling
her over would just be a nuisance to both of us.”

“I see… Well, can’t be helped then. I’d like to meet her sometime too if
I get the chance. She’s the Wizard of the Emerald Fairy, after all.”

Märchen Academy’s Magic Department, second-year second seat, Kaya
Astrea.

She was the youngest daughter of the Astrea Duchy, a holder of the plant
element, and known as the Wizard of the Emerald Fairy.

“Senior Kaya is known for her upright character and is praised by the
professors as having the best class attitude among the second-year Class
A students. She has the most credits too! And on top of that, she’s the
second seat…! How wonderful must she be? With an excellent character,
upright and sharp… She must be exactly like the ideal image I dream of.”

“It may not be exactly so, but it’s an honor for me that you think so
highly of my sister.”

“Ehehe.”

The two exchanged smiles pleasantly.

“With a senior like Kaya, there’s no need to worry. She will surely meet
someone cool and great in the future. Just like Senior Isaac .”

“She should…”

“…Yes?”

Merlin turned her head towards the lake, gripping the scabbard at her
waist.

“If Kaya were to meet some ruffian who flirts with every woman he
happened to come across…”

Merlin’s eyes transformed, becoming like those of a wild beast.

As a chilling aura emanated from her, White involuntarily shuddered.

“That man won’t be able to escape my sword.”

Daughter of the Sword Saint. A swordsmanship prodigy. Merlin Astrea.

How many in this world could face her sword and remain unscathed?

White swallowed hard. Instinctively feeling terror, a cold sweat ran
down her cheek.

“…Anyway.”

Soon, Merlin slowly blinked and composed her expression.

The cool and heavy atmosphere dissipated.

“Kaya can be a bit naive, so I worry. I hope she doesn’t develop
feelings for the wrong guy.”

“Ehe, he… M-Merlin, you are a wonderful sister…! It’s, uh, very nice to
worry about your sibling!”

“Ah, thank you.”

Only then could White wipe away her cold sweat.

It was uncertain what kind of man Kaya Astrea would meet but would he
really be able to meet the standards of the Sword Saint and Merlin?

‘No, first of all…’

It was worrisome whether he could even stay alive.

\*\*\*

“Isaac, I’m here.”

“Ah, Luce. Welcome.”

When the sky was tinged with the colors of the sunset.

At a corner of the Butterfly Garden. I was deeply engaged in training,
constructing a spell based on what I read in the book, and manipulating
mana.

I could already use 6-star magic, but it wasn’t yet at the level where I
could utilize it in combat.

On the frost-filled grass. A female student with rose-gold hair appeared
with a smile, holding a basket in both hands. It was Luce Eltania.

I gathered the magic circle and turned towards Luce.

“Hello\~!”

“…”

Luce ignored Dorothy’s lively greeting as if it were nothing. Pretending
not to hear, she looked only at me.

Luce approached me, giggling.

“I brought some bread in case you’re hungry. How’s the 6-star magic
going?”

“Still a long way to go. But I think I’ll reach my target in about two
weeks.”

“Hehe. That’s impressive, Isaac. Two weeks for that is incredibly fast.”

Ever since Luce became my friend, she gradually became brighter.

After I gave her the ring, her expression became as bright as any other
cheerful female student, a level incomparable to before.

In romance comics, characters were often depicted with flowers
blossoming around them; Luce now had that same aura. A radiant smile.

Of course, I was still the only one who could receive that smile.

“Isaac, it seems your talent is growing. I feel like you’re being
rewarded for your efforts, which makes me even happi- Hmm?”

“Hmm?”

It seemed like she was about to say something heartwarming, so I was
about to respond with a smile.

However, Luce suddenly placed her hand on my shoulder, went on her
tiptoes, and leaned her head close to my left ear.

It was a swift movement.

*-Sniff, sniff*

Luce was smelling my ear.

“What are you doing, Lu-.”

“Isaac.”

Luce’s eyes turned towards me.

Her expression was full of questions.

“What’s this smell?”

“…What smell?”

***Surely not.***

It couldn’t possibly be that she smelled the saliva Dorothy left on my
ear. That was utterly absurd.

Hours had passed since then… But, before considering time, how could she
even distinguish that?

Just then, Dorothy approached to check the basket.

“Nyahaha! Of course, I’ve brought my own too, right…? Huh?”

Luce quickly approached Dorothy, and placed her hand on the back of her
head…

…And sniffed around Dorothy’s left and right ears.

Then Luce’s head stopped in front of Dorothy’s right ear.

“Hey, Junior? What are you doing all of a sudden…?”

Dorothy looked flustered.

“Why…”

Suddenly, a grim aura emanated from Luce.

Even from a distance, I involuntarily shuddered.

Luce glared at Dorothy from a distance close enough for their breaths to
mingle.

Under her rose-gold bangs, shadows fell. Her aquamarine eyes appeared
dull like ashy gray. There was not a hint of liveliness in those cold
eyes.

Her expression was frozen, cold, and blank.

She was cynical, like a doll devoid of emotions.

Yet, her voice, laced with murderous intent, weighed heavily on the
scene.

“…Does your ear smell of Isaac’s saliva…?”

<span id="0157_159_Ring_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 159: Ring (5)
=====================

**༺ Ring (5) ༻**

“As for Isaac, he seems handsome.”

\[Hmm.\]

Luce wasn’t the type of person to care about the appearance of others.

This stemmed from her aversion to people, regardless of their
appearance.

Conversely, she only felt a sense of closeness with Isaac, but that
didn’t mean she paid much attention to his appearance.

Therefore, when Luce made such a comment, it felt completely unfamiliar
to Thunderbird Galia

“Yeah, he’s handsome.”

\[Hmm…\]

On a night when the sky was dark, Luce while reading a book in the
top-ranked dorm, Charles Hall, muttered to herself.

As she stroked her ring, she constantly thought of Isaac and giggled to
herself.

“I think Isaac is the most handsome one here.”

\[Hmm…\]

During the day, when the sky had scattered a clear light, Luce walked
along the outdoor corridor of the academy building and looked around at
the students. She made a remark, to which Galia nodded in agreement.

“I was friends with a really handsome guy…”

\[Hmm…\]

Even during training, she blurted it out as if she had just realized
Isaac’s handsome appearance.

“Isaac was handsome today too…!”

\[Hmm…\]

There wasn’t a day when the words, ‘Isaac is handsome’ didn’t spring
from Luce’s lips.

The most memorable day among these was when…

One day, as Luce was sitting on a bench reading a book, she looked down
at her ring and muttered…

The sunset light dyed her rose-gold hair and added color to her flushed
cheeks. The corners of her mouth danced freely.

Then, Luce monologued,

“Fine, Isaac…”

\[…\]

***One woman.***

It seemed as if she smelled of flowers.

Galia was involved in each of Luce’s services.

Therefore, he could understand the heart of his master, Luce, better
than anyone else.

More than ever, she was intoxicated with sweet emotions. Her heart
swelled, and the words that finally burst forth were…

Luce was happy.

The memories given by Isaac were perfect. The more she savored them, the
sweeter Luce felt.

On the ring finger of her left hand was a magic weapon in the form of a
ring.

However, it was said that only when worn on this finger would this magic
weapon take effect.

This ring already had an immeasurably precious meaning to Luce.

It had become yet another treasure for Luce.

To Luce, Isaac was an existence as precious as life itself.

She had to protect him, and she had to cherish him.

The memory of weeping while holding the dying body of the Candy House
Witch in her arms was also a deep-rooted and intense obsession etched
into the very depths of Luce’s being.

She didn’t want to regret anything anymore. Therefore, she tried to
remember everything about Isaac, understand everything about him,
cherishing him above all else.

She knew what Isaac’s fingerprints looked like. She memorized their
intricate patterns.

She knew what Isaac’s irises looked like. She memorized even the tiniest
of wrinkles.

She gauged Isaac’s hair length, nail length, stride, footsteps, and
frequently used hand gestures… all of it almost daily.

Yet, if she tried to pry into Isaac’s private life or kept him in her
arms as she pleased, he would leave.

During last semester’s social gathering, after committing a misdeed to
Isaac and apologizing, Luce reflected. Certainly, as a friend, she
shouldn’t try to manipulate the free will of another.

“But…”

At least, she wanted to imagine what kind of daily life Isaac had led,
even if only in a rough sense. It was her own compromise.

What came to mind was a scent. The smell of skin.

It enabled her to deduce what Isaac did throughout the day.

Luce practiced body buffing magic to enhance her sense of smell and
memorized all of Isaac’s scents.

Last semester, sometimes she would hug him or rest her chin on his
shoulder.

She closed the distance with Isaac through natural physical contact.

She remembered the scents emanating from various parts of his body,
categorized by different situations.

─‘Isaac, open your mouth right now.’

─‘Don’t people usually say, ‘Say ah,’ in this situation?’

A while ago, Luce fed Isaac with a spoon.

At first, she just wanted to feed him thinking he might be hungry. Being
with Isaac was enough to make her happy, so she had no other thoughts.

However, that day, as she smelled the fork that had been in Isaac’s
mouth, she decided to memorize the scent of his saliva.

On the way back, she focused on the smell of the fork and carefully
memorized the scent of his saliva.

She had memorized all the scents coming from his exterior…

…But she still didn’t know what scents came from inside his body.

At that time, in a corner of the Butterfly Garden.

Upon seeing Isaac, Luce immediately approached him and secretly checked
his scent.

There was a slightly different smell. From around his ear, there was an
unfamiliar scent.

Luce’s mind raced through numerous scenarios, quickly searching for the
source of the scent.

She approached Dorothy and sniffed her, just in case.

The scent of Isaac’s saliva was on Dorothy’s right ear. It had faded
over time, but the scent was still faintly there.

“What did you two… do?”

There was a hint of murderous intent in Luce’s voice.

She disliked Dorothy Heartnova because she took away most of the time
she could be alone with Isaac.

However, Dorothy was an important person to Isaac and someone he liked a
lot.

Therefore, Luce decided to stop at just not caring about Dorothy. Even
if Dorothy and Isaac were together, she would feel uncomfortable but
decided to respect it.

But, given the situation, it was clear that Isaac and Dorothy had bitten
and sucked on each other’s ears.

The thought of that scene made her feel like her stomach was turning.
She wanted to resolve the discomfort quickly.

So, hoping she was wrong, Luce had asked to confirm the truth.

“Luce, why are you acting like this all of a sudden?”

Isaac, using \[Psychological Insight\], understood Luce’s state of mind
and, after organizing his thoughts, approached her.

At that moment, Dorothy casually laughed and knocked Luce’s hand away
from her own head.

Isaac, taken aback, stopped in his tracks.

“Junior.”

Dorothy’s expression was subdued.

A faint smile was on her lips, however, it was merely a fake smile she
had learned to restrain herself from getting angry impulsively.

Her mood was disturbed by Luce’s aggressive attitude.

“Who are you threatening? So presumptuous.”

“…”

Dorothy’s voice, in contrast to her smile, was extremely cynical.

To that warning-like question, Luce gave no answer.

She just emotionlessly met Dorothy’s eyes.

Like a bomb about to explode, the hostility between the two women, like
boiling oil meeting water, collided, spreading an aura of danger in
their vicinity.

In the midst of this,

The slightly taller Dorothy looked down at Luce more closely and
murmured.

“What does it matter to you what Isaac and I do?”

“…”

“Since Isaac thinks highly of you, I’ve been trying my best to think
well of you too. But… what’s the point of my effort if you act so
rudely, Junior?”

Dorothy’s voice seemed to flow through memories of the past.

When she returned from her adventures in the Land of Oz, Dorothy had
nothing left.

The desolate landscape of her homeland still firmly occupied her
memories.

All she could see was the stigma of a curse that said if she bowed her
head, she would die within a few years.

Despite this, she gritted her teeth and lived on, using her talent in
magic to work as an adventurer, continuing a poor and miserable life.

Dorothy was young back then.

A young girl without connections was an object of contempt and disdain.

Her prodigious talent was an object of jealousy and persecution.

But to survive, she kept wearing a smiling mask, swallowing injustice
and frustration and struggled on for the sake of survival.

No matter how much Luce disregarded her, Dorothy’s playful and smiling
responses were nothing but a skilled coping mechanism born from such
experiences.

Dorothy wasn’t inherently good-natured. She was just enduring.

“Know your place, Luce Eltania. Big Sis here… doesn’t have much
patience.”

Luce frowned.

Just as she was about to say something, Isaac suddenly grabbed her
wrist.

And Luce’s mouth stopped forming words.

Luce and Dorothy’s gaze turned to Isaac.

“Luce, that’s enough.”

Isaac looked at Luce. Unlike his usual gentle eyes, his gaze was sharp
and serious.

Isaac liked both of them.

If he had lived in a monogamous society like Korea, he would have
naturally loved only one woman and wouldn’t have even glanced at
another.

But since he had come to a world where monogamy wasn’t the norm and met
people he liked.

Whether he left this place or stayed, he was brimming with a desire to
generously give his affection to those he liked.

He acknowledged that the deeper the emotional involvement, the more he
felt like trash. But what could he do when he liked them so much?

If his actions caused conflict between them.

He would consider that problem entirely his own and intended to take
responsibility.

Even if it led to them disliking him for it.

He couldn’t give up his affection for them, so he would humbly accept
it.

“Senior Dorothy too. Don’t fight.”

Isaac’s firm voice.

The heavy air.

Luce alternated her gaze between Isaac and Dorothy.

Luce already knew that Isaac and Dorothy had special feelings for each
other.

When she first saw Isaac examining the magic weapon ring, she naturally
thought of Dorothy first for that reason.

Isaac most likely loved Dorothy in a romantic way.

She didn’t want to admit it, but when she saw Isaac treasuring her, she
couldn’t help but notice.

But for Luce… there was only Isaac.

Luce couldn’t give up on him.

She looked down at the ring.

A magic weapon ring. It was a mysterious item that even the Eltania
family couldn’t easily obtain.

***“Bought it from an antique shop”? What a laughable excuse.***

However.

“Grrr…”

The Nameless Hero.

If Isaac were assumed to be a mysterious archwizard transcending common
sense, then it wouldn’t be strange no matter how extraordinary the magic
weapon he brought might be.

That was why Luce didn’t make any remarks when she received the ring.

She just spent a long time imagining a future together with Isaac.

“But President, you saw it too. She suddenly…”

“Haa.”

Luce’s sigh cut off Dorothy’s words.

After apologizing to Isaac during the social gathering, Luce resolved
not to repeat the same mistake.

When Isaac gave her the ring and painted a future together with her,
Luce’s resolve became even firmer.

It was for that reason she let go of her desire to monopolize the time
spent with him.

Accepting the fact that Isaac also had people he liked, she decided not
to manipulate him according to her will, but to respect and cherish him,
in order to stay by his side.

Of course, her heart didn’t always follow her intentions.

Luce was diligently working towards her resolution.

Luce, while calming her complex thoughts and painfully suppressing her
emotions, closed her eyes tightly and took a step back from Dorothy.

“…I’m sorry.”

Soon, Luce apologized.

Hearing that, Isaac was taken aback, and Dorothy had a bewildered
expression.

Luce didn’t want to be stubbornly naive and dogmatic as she was during
the social gathering when she attacked Kaya.

Trying to take Isaac by force would only lead to trouble.

It would only distance her from the future she envisioned with him.

Academy life.

As semesters passed and grades progressed, students rubbed shoulders,
experienced many things, grew, and underwent changes in thought.

Luce, now in her second year, had also grown.

Luce bowed her head to Dorothy.

“I’m sorry for getting angry.”

Luce stopped, her head still bowed.

When Dorothy didn’t respond, Luce continued to apologize.

“Oh, uh, uh, uh?!”

Her determination not to raise her head until the apology was accepted
was evident. Cold sweat ran down Dorothy’s cheeks.

Dorothy was flustered by the unexpected apology, never having
anticipated that Luce would apologize so readily.

“Ah, that, what! I’m sorry too for being so irritable…”

Dorothy’s right hand awkwardly hovered in the air, even her apology was
clumsy.

Dorothy looked at Isaac with an unnatural smile.

He nodded his head.

“Oh…”

Eventually, Dorothy contemplated and collected her expression.

Her thoughts were organized. Gradually, a gentle smile tugged at the
corners of her mouth.

“President, Big Sis just remembered something urgent. She thought of
something she needs to study!”

As a senior and an elder, Dorothy understood Luce’s sincerity and
decided to leave this place.

It was to give Isaac and her time to talk.

However, Dorothy mentioned studying was quite an unbelievable excuse.

“Ah, yes…”

“I’m going to head out for today! Good luck\~.”

“Take care on your way, Senior. Thank you.”

Isaac, noticing Dorothy’s intention, smiled.

Dorothy smiled broadly, waved at him, turned her back, and left.

The sun had set, and a deep blue pall of darkness hung over the sky.

Finally, as Dorothy’s figure disappeared, Luce raised her head.

Luce, standing demurely, gazed in the direction where Dorothy had left.

Her eyes were exceedingly cold.

Her face intermittently contorted as if writhing, repeatedly furrowing
and smoothing out, as she tried hard to conceal her emotions.

“…?”

Suddenly, Isaac realized.

The reason Luce hadn’t raised her head until Dorothy left was because
she was suppressing her emotions.

“Isaac, you.”

“Huh?”

Luce’s expressionless eyes turned towards Isaac.

“You like that senior, don’t you? In a romantic way.”

<span id="0158_160_Ring__Interlude.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 160: Ring — Interlude
=============================

**༺ Ring – Interlude ༻**

***The mood… isn’t very good.***

I didn’t expect to be asked so blatantly if I liked Dorothy. It hit me
hard.

She seemed to have already noticed, there was no point in hiding it.

“What do you want to say?”

“…”

Luce lowered her head and, without flinching, grabbed my sleeve with her
fingers and slightly pulled it. The Ring of the Abyssal Queen on her
ring finger gleamed with a black pearl hue.

I was reminded of the time I survived the Thunderbird Subjugation and
met Luce again. It felt like a reenactment of that time.

The words that Luce then uttered were,

“Please like me, Isaac.”

Her intimate tone tickled the air.

“Please like me more than that senior.”

Luce lifted her head while looking at me with a tender gaze.

“That might… be enough.”

She was revealing herself as she was, without trying to hide anything
from me.

For a while, I couldn’t utter a single word.

Silently, I pretended to ponder the meaning of Luce’s words,
deliberately pausing.

Eventually, Luce’s face gradually reddened.

She tried to maintain a calm expression, but the wandering of her eyes
suggested she realized the gravity of what she had said.

It was similar to the reaction she had when she asked me, ‘Do you want
to touch my breasts?’

It was immediately apparent that she had blurted out something
embarrassing to me because her emotions got the best of her.

“This is, well…”

Luce tried to stammer something out.

***Shall I take a guess?***

“Was that a confession just now?”

“An appeal for affection… We’re friends, after all.”

Luce smiled awkwardly.

***Well… with such a reaction, it’s best to respond lightly and end
it.***

She probably wouldn’t want to express her feelings to me, especially
after a tense situation with Dorothy and the mood turning sour.

I gently tapped Luce’s shoulder and smiled.

“Silly, friends don’t say things like that.”

“…Right?”

“Let’s have dinner. What did you bring?”

“Oh, meat and sandwiches. I only packed things that Isaac likes.”

I casually cheered her up and expressed my gratitude.

Luce took out a mat from the basket she brought and we sat down to have
dinner together.

All the while, Luce sneakily glanced at me. The atmosphere was awkward
throughout.

To break the uncomfortable silence, I teased Luce, and she gradually
teased me back, bringing back the old vibe.

I was about to leave.

“But Luce…”

There was one thing I was curious about. I really had to ask.

Luce, munching on her sandwich, looked at me.

“…How did you know the smell of my saliva?”

“…”

Luce’s mouth abruptly stopped.

…The atmosphere turned awkward again.

\*\*\*

Morning. In the Magic Department, Orphin Hall.

I was settling into a tiered lecture hall, getting ready for class. It
was the classroom for the second-year B class.

Around me, I could see guys like Ian Fairytale, Mateo Jordana, and
Tristan Humphrey.

Normally, Luce, the top seat of class A, would naturally come sit beside
me and display all sorts of affectionate actions.

But she was nowhere to be seen today. It seemed she decided not to come.

‘Is it because of that incident?’

Luce had asked me to like her more than Dorothy.

Even I would have felt embarrassed. It was understandable.

Each time Luce came to the class B classroom, she exuded an incredible
presence. Then I had to endure the burdensome stares of the students.

Certainly, being alone felt more liberating.

***Of course, it’s not that I don’t want to see Luce. How can I dislike
having such a pretty and lovely person cherish me so much that she
always wants to be by my side?***

***I’ve even gotten used to the burdensome stares of the other
students.***

For some reason, I felt a bit of emptiness.

“Professor Daisy arrives.”

Then the female professor of the second-year B class of the Magic
Department kicked the door open and entered. Several students were
visibly startled.

It was Professor Daisy, known for her ‘Middle school syndrome’. Her
first words during orientation were ‘In my eyes, a classroom is like a
crime scene just waiting to happen.’ Which solidified her eccentric
image. Anyway, her skills were outstanding, so I liked her.

Professor Daisy entered the classroom with books tucked under her arm
and stood in front of the lectern. The students hurried to their seats.

“Before we begin the class, there is an announcement,”

Said Professor Daisy in a solemn tone.

It was that time of the year.

“Soon, there will be a duel evaluation. Like last year, it will involve
using one or two duel request tickets to challenge an opponent of your
choice.”

Duel evaluations were held once every semester.

Each student receives two duel request tickets.

With one ticket, they could challenge anyone within their year.

The challenged could refuse, but if both tickets were used, they must
accept the duel.

So, the rules were similar to last year’s, with one exception.

“However, there is a change. This year, first-year students from the
Magic Department are also included as potential duel opponents. Please
keep this in mind.”

The students were visibly surprised, exclaiming, “Huh?”

The reason Märchen Academy included first-year students as potential
duel opponents was clear.

My juniors, the first-year students of the Magic Department at the time,
were known as the Golden Generation due to their strength.

It was probably to balance things out, by diverting the attention of the
strong first-year students towards their seniors. It helped maintain an
overall balance.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, second-year Ian Fairytale received a duel
request from the first-year, Priestess Miya.

This was because Ian was a ‘Light Element’ hero who had been slaying
demons.

It was a sub-event that offered a lot of experience points.

Having confirmed that defeating Verga and completing the sub-event
yielded a substantial amount of EXP, I expected this event would be no
different.

Of course, in this context, the demon slayer was The Nameless hero. That
was probably why Miya showed no particular interest in Ian.

***So, does this mean the sub-event is out of reach?***

It wasn’t feasible to challenge Miya either. Even if I did, there was no
guarantee that it would trigger the sub-event, and it seemed difficult
to defeat her right away. It was simply an unnecessary risk.

It would be fortunate if I didn’t get severely beaten while aiming for
the sub-event.

‘Anyway, who will I face?’

It was clear that dueling with others would help me grow. It never hurt
anybody to have more combat experience.

With my skills at the time, I could even consider challenging someone
from class A, maybe someone like Keridna Whiteclark.

Mateo also seemed like a suitable opponent.

Tristan, brimming with enthusiasm, was sure to challenge me.

***Well, there’s still plenty of time. I’ll think it over slowly.***

\*\*\*

“Hello, Senior. Would you like to duel?”

“…”

Even with \[Clairvoyance\] and \[Psychological Insight\], sometimes I
was startled by a person’s unexpected actions.

***Could now be one of those moments?***

While I strolling through the outdoor corridor of Orphin Hall, I
encountered a female first-year with jet-black hair. She blocked my path
and challenged me to a duel.

***Yep, it definitely was.***

“What if I refuse?”

“I’ll use both tickets. Then you have to accept, right?”

The junior waving two duel request tickets, with a folded black fan
against her lips, was Priestess Miya.

\[Miya\] **Lv:** 156

**Race:** Human

**Elements:** Fire

**Danger:** X

**Psychology:** \[Wants to defeat you to gain the attention of Luce
Eltania.\]

Students passing by all turned their attention towards me and Miya.

“Looks like the Priestess has already chosen her duel opponent?”

“What’s that? Is she using both her request tickets?”

“Who is that senior?”

“It’s Senior Isaac, the top student of Class B of the second year.”

“Why would the first-year top seat challenge Isaac…?”

The students who walked in the outdoor corridor murmured.

Miya, accustomed to always being the center of attention, seemed unfazed
by the whispers of the students.

“Why do you want to duel with me?”

“I’ve become curious about you, Senior. That’s all. I wish to duel with
you, so let’s duel Senior.”

A gentle early summer breeze caressed the skin as it passed.

Miya tilted her head with a lovely smile. Thanks to \[Psychological
Insight\], her intention to crush me mercilessly was clearly evident.

“Why aren’t you saying anything? Don’t tell me you’re frightened?”

“…”

It seemed Miya…

…Was intent on seriously provoking me, Luce’s weak spot.

In an official event like a duel, no matter how badly I could be
defeated by Miya, it would be difficult for Luce to intervene.

I was not sure what her intention was, but it was unlikely she harbored
any good intentions towards me.

***Anyway, it seems I might be able to capitalize on this sub-event…***

‘This is…’

***Too… unexpected, isn’t it?***

\* \* \*

“The movements of the Ice Kingdom, Düpfendorf, are unusual.”

In the northern part of the Zelver Empire, in the Whiteclark Duchy, it
snowed every day.

The Whiteclark Ducal Family. Their symbol was the white dragon that the
ancient Ice Sovereign summoned as his familiar, and a secret capable of
turning the world upside down was hidden in the basement of their grand
mansion.

The Whiteclark Mansion, in the underground Round Table meeting room.

Luxurious and opulent in appearance. However, the meeting room was dark,
illuminated only by the faint light of glowing lamps.

Around the round table, figures made of elements sat in each high seat.

A figure of fierce flames. The Fire Sovereign.

A figure of crackling lightning. The Lightning Sovereign.

A figure of clear water. The Water Sovereign.

A figure of billowing wind. The Wind Sovereign.

The moderator and the next Northern Grand Duchess with pink hair, Aichel
Whiteclark, held a power that could shake the world…

She stood in a respectful posture in front of these powerful figures.

The Council of Kings.

Regular meetings occurred once every three years, and emergency meetings
could be convened upon the proposal of one or more members when
global-scale issues arose.

Aichel Whiteclark of the Whiteclark Ducal Family was chosen as the
moderator of the Council of Kings meeting.

Typically, not all Kings would attend these emergency meetings.

This was because they had a mutual agreement not to interfere in each
other’s territories unless their own nation was at risk.

Most often, they showed no interest in matters unless they were
intriguing; they hardly felt a sense of crisis unless it involved a
potential world-ending scenario.

However, the subject of this emergency meeting was so beyond imagination
that, unusually, all four current Kings attended.

“It seems that you have realized the emergence of the next Ice
Sovereign.”

\[Düpfendorf… indeed, it would be strange if you were not aware. Ha
ha…\]

The voice of the aged Fire Sovereign, an elderly man, echoed in the
round table meeting room.

The Fire Sovereign, emitted a scoffing laugh as if in disbelief, and
lightly stroked his long, flowing beard. As he did, the flames
flickered.

The Ice Kingdom, Düpfendorf.

A nation comprised of mighty ice magic beasts and the powerful human
descendants of the Frost Race.

Ice magic beasts who had reached the celestial and earthly realms, like
the Glacial Bear, Frost Spirit, and the Icebound Crocodile, also
considered Düpfendorf their homeland.

For over a thousand years since the passing of the original Ice
Sovereign, the throne had remained vacant.

The people of Düpfendorf had long awaited the emergence of a new Ice
Sovereign.

Aichel Whiteclark, a lover of peace, had been closely monitoring
Düpfendorf’s activities. Recently, she had noticed unusual movements in
the country.

“The one served by the White Dragon and the Primordial Beast of Ice, the
next Ice Sovereign, ‘The Nameless Hero’.”

Aichel lowered her eyes.

“It’s impossible that Düpfendorf didn’t feel the mana of the Ice
Sovereign that spread every time demons have appeared at Märchen Academy
since last year. An especially crucial moment was when the power of the
Primordial Beast of Ice spread briefly.”

A monster among monsters, presumed to have even surpassed the Primordial
Elemental Kings.

The next Ice Sovereign, a formidable force that even the Elemental Kings
who were present dared not provoke.

Each country ruled by the Elemental Kings had a treaty with the Zelver
Empire to generally not interfere with each other.

Whether The Floating Island had appeared in the Zelver Empire or not, as
long as the damage did not affect their own nation, there was no reason
to intervene.

The next Ice Sovereign was at Märchen Academy, belonging to the Zelver
Empire.

This fact was certain, yet none of the Elemental Kings had visited the
academy.

This was due to the treaty issue and also out of respect for the next
Ice Sovereign.

\[I’d like to see him once. Hopefully, a frail-looking boy. Then, I’d
sincerely cherish him…\]

The Elemental King of water, the Water Sovereign stroking her cheek, had
the form and voice of a mature woman.

\[Water Sovereign, the next Ice Sovereign is not a pushover for you to
impose your perverted desires upon.\]

\[Please don’t misunderstand, Mr. Jaul. I just want to make a good
impression on the new Ice Sovereign.\]

To the critique from Jaul, the Lightning Sovereign, the Water Sovereign
replied with a voice tinged with laughter.

\[Because… the next Ice Sovereign seems to be quite dangerous.\]

The Water Sovereign added in a soft voice.

\[…Probably quite soon.\]

“Yes. It won’t be long before Düpfendorf welcomes its new King,”

Aichel responded to the Fire Sovereign.

The air grew tense. Aichel hid her surprise at the fact that even the
strongest beings in this world could feel tension.

Isaac, a second-year student at Märchen Academy.

The people of the Ice Kingdom, Düpfendorf, along with a massive army and
catastrophic ice magic beasts, would unanimously serve him as their
King.

No one could predict how powerful an Elemental King he would become,
being accompanied by the White Dragon and the Primordial Beast of Ice.

The balance of power that constituted the world was on the verge of
entering a new phase.

Perhaps soon…

…The most dangerous Elemental King in the world might emerge.

Chapter 161: Bet (1)
====================

**༺ Bet (1) ༻**

Black and red.

A mysterious space decorated in a checkered pattern. Red furniture was
scattered throughout the room with tilted clocks filling the walls.

This was Alice’s Labyrinth.

Within the dreary atmosphere, three students in their uniforms were
seated on pieces of furniture, quietly waiting for the Spade Paladin.

“…How does it feel to be suspended.”

The red-haired female student with a heart-shaped accessory, Shera
Hectorica, broke the silence.

The question was directed at the brown-haired female student leaning
against the wall, Alexa.

Alexa narrowed her eyes and glared at Shera.

“Phwah! What’s that look supposed to mean? I was just trying to lighten
the mood.”

“Shut up.”

Alexa shot back coldly.

But Shera continued to smile cheerfully.

The four Paladins had failed to stop the Nameless Hero during the
first-year students’ joint practical evaluation.

Moreover, they hadn’t been able to find even a slight hint of who they
could be, making it their complete defeat.

The only information they gained was the Nameless Hero’s strength, which
the Spade Paladin witnessed with his own eyes.

The Hero had been far stronger than what any of them had imagined. It
was to the point where they questioned whether they would actually be
able to defeat them.

Alice did not criticize the Paladins, but that instead made the Paladins
feel even guiltier.

***They will not fail next time.***

They must find clues to discern the identity of the Black Monster.

After the Abyssal Sea Monster incident, each of the Paladins vowed as
such.

Just then, footsteps rang out through the room.

A male student appeared from the darkness that replaced one side of the
wall.

Black hair with a faint blue hue. It was the Spade Paladin.

“Captain!”

“You’re here.”

“…”

Shera addressed him cheerfully, the Clover Paladin greeted him kindly,
and Alexa remained silent.

The Spade Paladin sat down on a fancy chair with his legs crossed.

His posture reflected his desire to seem intelligent, with his back
straight and body positioned with elegance.

“Why did you say to gather, Captain?”

Shera asked the Spade Paladin, dashing up to the chair he was sitting on
and plopping down on the armrest.

He fixed his glasses before speaking.

“The duel evaluation will begin soon. They say that we will be able to
select second-year students as opponents as well. In other words, that
means we will be able to watch the duels of both first and second
years.”

The Spade Paladin continued with a serious expression.

“Diamond’s suspension should end by the time the duel evaluation begins.
Four locations will be used for the duel arenas. Students will be
divided into four groups and assigned to an arena. The Queen has said
she will assign each of us to a different group, so…”

“Keep watch of every ice element user?”

Shera continued the sentence with a grin.

The Spade Paladin responded with silence.

“With your skills, you should be able to recognize any suspicious
behavior. Keep a careful watch on anyone with the ice element. They work
under disguise using a high-quality camouflage disguise, so it is
unclear whether they are a male or female. It seems that the demon who
had been cooperating with the Queen last year had been watching the duel
evaluation in secret and foolishly planned to cause a massacre that
failed.”

Because of the demon who had been working with Alice last year, Leafa
the Illusive, the fact that the demons had an informant within the
academy had been revealed.

That caused the academy to add extra caution when revealing information
to the administrative students.

This meant that the information provided to Alice had also become
limited.

“However, since we are students, there shouldn’t be any problems. Of
course… As long as we refrain from doing something foolish to attract
attention.”

The Spade Paladin glared at Alexa. She was the biggest problem out of
the Paladins, after all.

Alexa shook her head.

“…I’ll keep quiet.”

Feeling pressured, Alexa answered as such.

“And I will remind you. Suspect and keep watch of not only the students
but also the staff and the others.”

Their main goal was discovering the identity of the Black Monster, after
all.

Shera responded with an enthusiastic, “Yeah!” the Clover Paladin nodded
his head, and Alexa showed no reaction.

“Ah, right. Captain. Can I ask you one thing?”

“What is it, Shera?”

“The person that the Queen is suspicious of, Isaac, was it? Can I
challenge him to a duel?”

A second-year student of the Magic Department, Isaac.

Alice suspected him to be the one disrupting her plans, and she said
that she would be personally investigating whether he was the disrupter
or not.

However, because it was a mere suspicion, they could not concentrate
their resources on just Isaac, so the four Paladins acted while leaving
Isaac in their line of suspects.

“It doesn’t matter if you have a valid reason, but I would not recommend
it.”

“Why?”

“The Priestess has already challenged him to a duel. Why she has done
that is a question for later. Do not forget that we are also often
mentioned among the students because of our mana grade. The more Isaac
becomes known, the bigger the nuisance it would become for the Queen.”

“Hmm…”

Shera was disappointed.

She liked to attract attention to herself, but she wanted to refrain
from doing something that would anger Alice.

“Shera, remember that our task for the duel evaluation is to ‘observe’.
Don’t go around having the foolish idea of getting revenge on Luce
Eltania, either. Our plans will go awry if you do so.”

“Ergh! Fine, I won’t, I won’t! I hate you, Captain!”

“What…? Why so suddenly?”

Shera complained, expressing discontent, and walked away from the Spade
Paladin.

He had hurt her pride by mentioning her defeat against Luce Eltania.

“Captain, you can’t talk about losing and whatnot in front of Shera.”

The Clover Paladin addressed the problem with a small smile.

“Yeah, that’s really mean!”

And Shera hid behind the Clover Paladin’s back, sticking out her tongue.

“…”

The Spade Paladin let out a deep sigh as if he was utterly fed up.

\* \* \*

“S-s-s-senior Isaac…? You’re dueling with whom…?”

“Miya.”

The Magic Department classroom building, Orphin Hall. Inside of an empty
research room.

I had all sorts of books and parchments laid out as I calculated the
magic formulas within them, which helped me use the 6-star ice magic
\[Frost Glitter\] with greater efficiency.

Thanks to my \[Learning Efficiency\] being maxed, it was easy to think.
It felt like I could calculate any algorithm or formula in my head no
matter what someone threw my way.

I already had all of the forms of magic circles I needed to use for each
magic memorized. But it still took some time because using the magic
circles with swift accuracy was a different story.

Still, I judged it wouldn’t be long until Isaac, with \[Hunter\]
deactivated, could use 6-star magic in battle.

At the latest, I should be able to learn it before my duel with Miya.

I felt that I had arrived at a new level of magical talent.

The sun had begun to set at some point.

Snow White had come to visit me while I had been taking a short break,
so I was chatting with her.

Today was one of the days I asked White to take a break from mentoring.

However, it wasn’t a mystery why she had come to see me regardless. We
always had our schedules shared.

White stood before the window, and I sat in a chair, leaning on the
backrest.

White’s pure white hair became dyed with the colors of the sunset.
Following her nickname as the Snow White Princess, her outer appearance
often absorbed the colors of her surroundings.

I was shocked by her beauty, even though she was only in her academy
uniform. Her shocked expression also reflected her wide variety of
expressions.

“I know Senior Isaac is strong, but the Priestess is too strong…!”

“I couldn’t really help it. She used both of her duel requests on me.”

“Why is she going so far to duel with you? I haven’t seen the Priestess
together with Senior Isaac once… Has anything happened between the two
of you that I don’t know? Like you’ve run into her in the hallways or…”

“I’m not sure either.”

It was probably because of Luce, but telling White that wouldn’t change
anything, so I kept the reason to myself.

“Well, it’s not like it’s anything new for the Priestess to try fighting
someone random for a weird reason. She is quite the oddball, after all.”

“She does seem a little strange.”

“…”

“What is it, White?”

“Oh, no. It’s nothing…”

With a listless smile, White turned her head and avoided my gaze. Tears
seemed to be forming in her eyes.

It looked like she thought about how she had to become friends with the
Priestess and was reminded of her personality.

“A-anyway!”

White stole away her tears and turned back to me with clenched fists.

“Was that why you were practicing this magic? So you can fight against
the Priestess?”

“It isn’t necessarily because of the duel, but the timings do happen to
overlap. It’s merely a lucky coincidence.”

I extended my finger and channeled a frigid chill through them. Cold air
and ice crystals floated above my finger.

I then spread my other fingers and repeated that process. It was a
habitual magic mastery training I did.

“S-senior Isaac… Aren’t you scared? If it were me, I would be scared…”

“Not really, no.”

Then, curling my fingers back in, I withdrew the ice.

“My goal is Luce, after all.”

“What…?”

“Well, the Priestess is weaker than Luce. I don’t have much to be scared
about, right?”

“W-wait. Senior Luce…?!”

White’s jaw dropped once more in shock.

“Your goal is to surpass Senior Luce?!”

“Why are you so surprised…?”

“Of course I am…! Senior Luce is one of the most talented students in
this academy! She’s really strong and elegant…”

“I’ll definitely beat her during the duel evaluation next semester.”

***Grades. It was an impartial indicator of how much stronger I’ve
gotten.***

I at least wanted to be the top student in my grade before facing the
Evil God during my third year.

“But why Senior Luce…?”

“I want to win, it’s as simple as that.”

Of course, there was some personal ambition included in that goal.

One could call it a primal instinct of wanting to be rewarded for their
efforts.

For some reason, White was gazing at me with an awestruck expression. It
even looked like her eyes were sparkling.

I read her psychology. She seemed inspired by what I said since she
hadn’t even considered fighting against the Priestess, much less beating
her.

‘It was the same for me too.’

I had set the goal to take the title of top seat from the beginning, but
I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed once I saw Luce in person.

It was impossible to imagine a future where I could win against her.

Repeating countless duels and defeats against her, I even felt a wall
standing between us.

But now, I had entered the realm of geniuses and, even now, was
improving at a frightening speed.

So, saying that I would defeat Luce wasn’t completely unrealistic.

***Not to mention, small goals like these will help motivate me.***

***Yeah.***

By Semester 2 Year 2, I should become strong enough to fight against
Luce, with her wearing the Ring of the Abyssal Queen. That was my goal.

***…Of course, surviving until then will come first.***

“Anyhow, that’s my plan. My break time’s over, so see you next time,
White.”

“Ah. A-alright…!”

White scanned her surroundings awkwardly.

“Anyway, 6-star magic really seems to be on a different level. The magic
I’ve been practicing until now seems like child’s play… Saying you’ll
beat Senior Luce and such, you’re amazing, Senior Isaac. Eheheh.”

“Really?”

***That’s sweet of her.***

White and I looked at one another and grinned.

“See you tomorrow, Senior!”

“Be safe. And don’t forget to train.”

“Yessir!”

White left the research room.

After using \[Clairvoyance\] to check that she met with Merlin, who was
waiting in front of Orphin Hall, I resumed my training.

\*\*\*

The next day, daytime.

After class, I was about to leave the second-year B Class classroom
within Orphin Hall. However, since the next class was canceled, I
planned to use that time to practice my 6-star magic.

Just then. A commotion suddenly arose in the hallway for second years,
and a female student began walking my way with everyone’s gazes
concentrated on her.

That orderly appearance. She was a member of the Student Council, Head
Hall Monitor Erin.

“You’re Isaac, right?”

***Why’s she here?***

I stood straight, facing her.

“The Student Council President is calling for you. Follow me.”

“…?”

***…Huh?***

<span id="0160_162_Bet_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 162: Bet (2)
====================

**༺ Bet (2) ༻**

Only a few people used the outdoor training grounds at Märchen Academy.

The biggest reasons were that it was far from the dorms, and the
facility was poorly established compared to the other training grounds.

And on those very grounds stood one man, immersed in his training under
the intense rays of sunlight.

Shirtless, he was repeatedly squatting with his arms above his head.

In his arms was a large boulder, easily exceeding 3 meters in size.

He was drenched in sweat. The more squats he did, the larger his muscles
seemed to bulge.

A third-year student with dark green hair, an elite member of Black
Tiger, one of the Four Constellations. He was Verga Rayphelt.

“Senior Verga! Your one and only cute junior is here!”

“Janie?”

Second-year student Janie, another member of the Black Tiger, approached
him and saluted playfully, to which Verga responded without looking. His
voice fell heavily.

Verga did not stop his squats.

“Why did you come?”

“To deliver an announcement.”

“Then tell me already and leave.”

“Heheh. That’s cold, you know.”

Janie deftly lightened the mood with her charming laugh.

“By the way, that boulder looks bigger than usual. You’re excited for
the duel evaluation, aren’t you?”

As someone who favored duels, the duel evaluation of each semester was
an event Verga eagerly anticipated.

It gave him a proper excuse to force those he wanted to fight to duel
him.

However…

“Not necessarily.”

“What? Why?”

Verga tossed the boulder he was holding in front of him.

*Thooomp—-!*

As the heavy boulder fell onto the ground, a loud collision could be
heard, along with a cloud of dust.

Within the swiftly dispersing dust, Verga’s glistening body heaved to
his heavy panting.

Janie let out a whistle with a perverted expression.

“I’m not interested in it. What I want to do right now is flatten *that
bastard’s* nose.”

“*That bastard?* Ah.”

There was only one person Verga would call *‘that bastard’*.

Second-year student of the Magic Department. His silver-blue-haired
junior, Isaac.

Last year, Verga had been humiliated by fainting from a single blow by
Isaac.

However, it was different now. His muscles, the defense that he boasted
so pridefully, had improved tenfold.

He would no longer lower his guard and act arrogant. If there was a
chance to duel Isaac once more, he would most definitely achieve an
overwhelming victory and clear the humiliations of the past.

Verga believed that with confidence.

“Right now, before the duel evaluations begin, I plan to duel with him
again. I believed that would be enough time to settle my emotions. I
will not be provoked nor taint the Black Tiger’s honor.”

“Honor? Wow, so you remembered what I said to you last year. I didn’t
know Senior had a sensitive spot or held grudges like a stinge.”

Janie remarked playfully.

“…Is that a challenge?”

“Heheh.”

Janie scratched her head and giggled charmingly. That single giggle was
always enough to instantly settle Verga’s anger.

Verga glared at her, then commented, “You’re lucky you’re cute.” Then,
picked up his uniform shirt and jacket from the clothes hanger, tossing
it over one shoulder,

“That reminds me. Isaac, that guy. He was recently challenged to a duel
by the Priestess. It looks like he’s pretty popular, good or bad.”

“Priestess or whatever, it doesn’t matter.”

Verga walked past Janie.

“Where are you going?”

“I told you.”

***Is he going to challenge Isaac to a duel?***

Janie responded, “Aha. Well, then. Good luck,” and cheered Verga with
clenched fists.

Watching Verga walk off into the distance, Janie stared at his broad
shoulders with mesmerization.

Then, realizing what she had forgotten, she hurriedly shouted to him.

“Senior Verga, there’s an announcement!”

Janie rushed to chase after Verga.

Meanwhile, near the Magic Department classroom building.

Orphin Hall, on an outdoor bench.

The blue-gray-haired first-year male student, Abel Carnedas, was leaning
against the bench’s backrest while waiting for his friend in the Magic
Department.

It was to spar and train their magic together. As an aspiring Magic
Knight, he could not slack in magic practice.

However, a different thought was currently wandering within Abel’s mind.

The first person he had thought of when hearing the news about the
semester’s duel evaluation was his Senior in the Magic Department,
Isaac.

Though he could not request a duel with him because they were in
different departments, he deeply wished to fight Isaac again.

The memories of losing to him during the joint practical evaluation had
added fuel to his competitive spirit.

With those thoughts in mind, a question suddenly popped into his mind.

‘Why did the Priestess use both of her duel requests on Senior Isaac…’

Miya. The top seat of the Magic Department first-years. Rumors about her
were widespread within the academy since she was the Priestess of the
Eastern Nation.

It was a clear display of interest for her to have used two of her duel
requests on Isaac.

Though it was likely not a positive form of interest, it was clear that
Isaac had attracted her attention somehow.

“Is there something special about Senior Isaac?”

Isaac was unique.

Though part of the Magic Department, he had a physique similar to
someone from the Knight Department. No, even among the Knight Department
students, he would be considered in the higher ranks.

But that didn’t mean he lacked magical power, and his fighting sense was
admirable.

He knew other seniors with nicknames, such as the Star Witch and the
Wizard of the Emerald Fairy.

However, as an aspiring Magic Knight, Abel felt much more interest and
admiration towards Isaac.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, he could hear a commotion on a higher floor of Orphin Hall.
They all seemed to be talking about the same topic.

Abel tilted his head even higher and stared at one of the windows of
Orphin Hall.

\* \* \*

The Hall Monitors, a group associated with Märchen Academy’s Student
Council.

The group’s objective was to maintain and protect the elegance and order
of the academy.

So, out of the extra NPCs, Head Hall Monitor Erin habitually used an
authoritative tone.

“The Student Council President called for Isaac…?”

“Do they want to recruit Isaac into the Student Council?”

“No… The Student Council? Wait, really…?”

“It seems reasonable if it’s Isaac we’re talking about.”

Just being part of the Student Council caused Head Hall Monitor Erin to
collect a significant amount of attention.

Since the attention had been concentrated on us, my name also began
circulating among them.

It didn’t matter.

The reason I had been sensitive to gossip in the first place was because
of Alice.

If the gossip had started because of Alice, then there was no need for
me to pay attention to it.

“May I ask *why* she’s calling for me?”

I asked her calmly. Since Erin was a third-year, I spoke politely to
her.

“You’ll know when you’re there. It will be good news for you. Let’s go.”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to.”

***Why should I?***

“…Huh? What did you just…?”

“I’m busy. I can’t delay my training.”

“…???”

She was flustered. She must have thought that mentioning the Student
Council would solve all of her problems.

Although I thought she was pretty hard-headed in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, she really was quite flimsy.

The students that had been watching us stared in shock.

Silence circled the hallway.

***How can it be good news when the person calling for me is trying to
kill me?***

***It’s obvious I should run away.***

Reading Erin’s psychology, it looked like Alice mentioned to her that
she wanted to invite me to the Student Council. Her intentions couldn’t
be any more obvious.

“Isaac. I do not think it is appropriate for you to ignore the President
just because of a little training…!”

“Tell her that I apologize.”

Then I passed by Erin and walked away.

Alice suspected me of being the Nameless Hero.

Back when we walked together under the umbrella, I tried my best to show
her that I didn’t fit the bill.

But people had intuition, and she had an especially sharp one. It was
difficult to withdraw suspicion once the seed had been planted.

That was why it would be ideal not to interact with Alice until the
final bits of Semester 1 Year 2, 「Alice Subjugation」.

The students almost seemed to scream out gasps. I heard someone question
my sanity.

It didn’t matter. I had expected to be talked about if I became
associated with Alice.

If it was going to happen anyway, I might as well plant the impression
that I was busy training and should not be bothered.

Just then, I sensed an ominous mana and stopped walking.

\[Master.\]

Hilde’s voice rang inside of my head. She was hiding as a small ball of
light under the collar of my uniform shirt.

Her role was to sense the magic beast I was the most wary of within this
academy.

‘I felt it too.’

It was harder not to sense it when they were being this obvious.

\[Meoow. Aren’t you being a little too cold?\]

Suddenly, a strange voice that was neither male nor female came from the
hallway’s window. I turned my head in the direction of the voice.

There sat a fat purple cat magic beast wearing a small fedora, Phantom
Cat Cheshire, looking at me from its seat on the windowsill.

\[This is an important matter, so I would ask that you come with us.\]

***They’re pressuring me.***

Though I hadn’t usually felt the Phantom Cat watching me, it looked like
it had come to check if I was complying with Alice’s order this time.

“The Student Council President’s familiar…!”

“Wow, it’s so cute!”

The students cheered.

Their reactions were lighter and changed directions more easily than
reeds blowing in the wind.

The Phantom Cat coughed sheepishly at the compliments directed at it,
then puffed up its chest pridefully.

That confident smile. It somehow reminded me of Dorothy.

But while it was doing so, it continued to radiate a heavy aura towards
me. It was a silent pressure, telling me not to refuse.

“…”

***…This isn’t good.***

I wasn’t confident enough to refuse when even the Phantom Cat came into
the picture.

I didn’t want to risk worsening its mood. I wasn’t sure if I could
handle the consequences if that happened. This thing acted depending on
its mood. It was difficult to predict its actions.

I scanned my surroundings. There were already plenty of witnesses. Alice
wouldn’t hastily reveal her true colors and try to hurt me already.

In the first place, if she had solid proof that I was the Nameless Hero,
she would have used secretive methods to get rid of me. She wouldn’t
start an outright fight with no clear way of winning.

Of course, that was just on the surface. If I fought with Alice right
now, I would most definitely lose.

Anyway, was Alice planning to corner me little by little? This time, it
was an invitation to the Student Council.

Well, I just needed to act clueless until Alice was subjugated.

…I finished thinking. I faced Phantom Cat Cheshire, then turned around
to look at Erin.

She was staring blankly at me.

\*\*\*

“President, I’ve brought him.”

The center of the academy’s administration, Bartos Hall.

*Knock knock.*

Head Hall Monitor Erin knocked on the Student Council room door. A kind
voice called out, “Come in,” from inside.

“Go in.”

Erin opened the door and stepped out of the way.

\[Meoww! Cheshire here\~. Alice, I brought Isaac!\]

I entered the Student Council room together with Cheshire. Erin then
bowed her head and closed the door.

A luxurious lamp was hanging from the ceiling, and countless pieces of
expensive furniture surrounded us. The elegant and antique design suited
the room nicely.

‘This is my first time coming here after possessing this body.’

***So this is how the Student Council room looked in person. It looks
cool.***

My scan lasted only a brief moment.

A warm breeze made the curtains dance. In front of the large arch window
was an office desk.

The light gold-haired female student seated there looked at me, then
rested her chin on her clasped hands and smiled leisurely.

“Hello, Baby. How have you been?”

Her voice was kind.

She seemed like a sunflower, smiling brightly as the sun shone behind
her.

“Senior Alice…”

She was Alice Carroll.

The Student Council President and final boss of the 「Alice
Subjugation」.

After a fierce battle against Ian Fairytale and his companions, she lost
to them.

Ultimately, she ended own her life with a hollow smile, as if she had
given up on everything.

Along with Dorothy, she was a student who always met a tragic end in
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I could not see her status page or read her psychology. This was due to
her unique trait, \[Red Queen’s Paradox\].

Hiding my anxiety, I used my acting skills to return a natural smile.

“I’ve been doing well. I must thank you again for the events during
winter vacation.”

“Oh, no. I just happened to be in the mood to do so.”

It was a generic response expected of a kind and boring senior.

“Ah, sit there. Would you like some tea?”

“No, I’m fine, thank you.”

I ignored the sofa that Alice pointed to and approached her.

With the large office desk standing between us, I gazed down at her.

“What have you been up to?”

***Acting friendly right away, is she testing me?”***

“I’ve been training. You must have been busy with Student Council work,
no?”

“Yes. I’m going to be suffocated by these papers one day.”

“Truly a shame.”

I gave a stereotypical response to the subtly playful answer that Alice
provided.

“But this semester is your final term. There has been a lot of talk and
struggles with the demons and all, but I’m sure you will go great until
the end.”

“I like how you talk, Baby.”

Alice stood up from her seat with a smile. The chair creaked as it slid
back.

“But why did you call? And just me at that.”

“There was a favor I wanted to ask of you.”

Alice walked around to the front of the office desk, then, standing in
front of me, leaned slightly against the desk.

***A favor, you say.***

I liked that she went straight to the point. It was obviously going to
be an invitation to come to the Student Council.

I was a student with clear records of improvement and currently rivaled
the strength of those in Class A of the Magic Department second-years.

Looking at my current skills and future potential, it was obvious that
the Four Constellations and the Student Council wanted me.

‘Though I definitely have to refuse.’

I couldn’t waste time training by becoming associated with some group.

Well, I already had an excuse to reject the tempting offer to enter the
Student Council.

***I’ll finish the conversation quickly and leave.***

“What is it?”

“It’s nothing special.”

When I questioned her, Alice tilted her head slightly to the side with a
relaxed smile.

Following her movement, her silky light-gold hair that reflected the
sunlight slid down her uniform.

The words that followed had been so far from my expectations.

That I couldn’t maintain a straight face.

“Why don’t we go on a date today?”

“…What?”

***That’s quite… special.***

<span id="0161_163_Bet_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 163: Bet (3)
====================

**༺ Bet (3) ༻**

“It’s the Student Council President…!”

“She’s so pretty…”

“Who’s that next to the President? He doesn’t look like a Student
Council member.”

“That’s Isaac.”

“Why are those two together?”

“Isaac was called by the Student Council President earlier…”

“Was he invited to the Student Council then?”

Traits of the academy genre. Students became chatterbots when the
Student Council President made an appearance.

Since I was strolling through the campus with Alice Carroll, the
students’ attention naturally swarmed toward us.

I purposefully held a magic tool in my hand and pretended to be paying
attention to training my mana mastery in an attempt to ignore the
students’ gazes.

Well, I did understand their actions.

‘Alice is practically a celebrity here.’

I had also cheered until my throat went soar when female celebrities
came to perform during my time in the military.

Just starting with Dorothy, I was always in awe of her goddess-like
beauty. It was similar to that.

***But more than that…***

‘What brought me all the way here?’

Right in front of me was the light gold-haired female student, walking
with her hands behind her back.

Watching her from behind, I was maintaining a certain distance from her.
She was the Student Council President and my senior in the Magic
Department. Alice Carroll.

***Just what is she scheming to suddenly call me and request a date?***

In the Student Council room, Alice had left no room for conversation and
immediately left the room after saying to me, “Let’s have a date, Baby.”

So, I had no choice but to follow her out.

She hadn’t given me a chance to respond, but it would’ve felt wrong not
to follow her.

I ignored Erin, who had been standing in front of the Student Council
room. I could still remember her flustered face.

“Baby.”

Alice turned her head to look back at me but did not stop walking.

***That’s one pleasant voice she had there.***

It was different from Luce’s. Her voice was calm and whispery and had
the knack of sucking the energy out of someone.

In comparison, Alice’s voice sounded much kinder, as if falling into
fluffy cotton candy. Just listening to her made my heart feel all warm
and fluffy.

“Yes, Senior.”

“While we’re at it, why don’t you come walk over here? It feels a little
lonely without someone next to me.”

“That’s a little… uncomfortable for me.”

I intentionally swung my head around to our surroundings.

It was to express my discomfort with every single student passing by
staring at us and to use it as an excuse.

Alice wanted to kill me… or the disruptor of her plans, to be more
exact.

So I could only relax when I stayed behind her like this.

I was scared that she would try something on me if I stood right next to
or in front of her. It was similar to how someone would become
irrationally nervous when showering.

“You’re more conscious of other people’s opinions than I expected.”

“It isn’t that I dislike standing out, but you’re a little too much,
Senior. Not only are you the Student Council President, but you’re also
pretty.”

“That is true.”

Alice readily agreed.

It was basically a fact to her that she was considered pretty.

“And Senior. You still haven’t said anything to me.”

“Ah, about why I wanted to have a date with you. Right?”

“Yes.”

Alice brought her slightly bent index finger up to her lip and fell into
deep thought. Was she choosing her words?

Soon, Alice answered.

“Just ‘cause.”

“Pardon?”

“Because I wanted to. I had some time today and just happened to think
of you. That’s it.”

I knew she wouldn’t reveal her intentions.

But what was “Just ’cause” supposed to be? She didn’t even try adding
effort to it.

“Why does it matter though? Doesn’t it make you excited to have a date
with me?”

Alice assumed as if that was obviously the case.

I wasn’t excited. More like dumbstruck…

“Uh, Senior Alice. I couldn’t tell you because everything happened so
suddenly, but I have to train now… Senior?”

Alice suddenly stopped and locked her gaze on the display stand of a
particular shop, almost as if she were hypnotized.

I also stopped next to her and followed her gaze.

It was a dessert café called, “The Siren’s Face”.

Inside the display stand, using an ice magic scroll, were parfaits
sparkling with a small amount of mana.

Out of them, a parfait decorated in the shape of a cat stood in the
center like the shop’s signature dish.

It was a pretty cute parfait and the thing that likely caught Alice’s
attention.

“…”

For a moment, time seemed to have stopped.

As my mind raced ferociously, one realization suddenly arose to the
surface.

Many people discussed Alice’s identity within the ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ community.

However, just one thing. Just one of Alice’s traits was seldomy
mentioned.

It was the fact that she liked cute things.

When I played the game, I just passed over it as a simple character
trait, but witnessing it in person caused the question to swell up in my
mind.

‘Why would someone like her.’

Just why would she try to kill Ian Fairytale and give up on everything
and end her life when she failed?

***What did that hollow smile she showed to Ian Fairytale and his
companions just before death mean?***

***And why had Alice secretly become an informant?***

It might be that I was missing something important.

I needed to find out.

Now that ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ had become my reality, I needed to
make a detailed plan for even the tiniest of details.

‘After all, I’ve already lost to the Evil God once.’

This current chance had been given to me by the sacrifices of countless
people.

In my past life, before it was reset, I had to survive whatever it took.
This also meant that everything may end if I had died.

So I must not strive for the best choice, but the most ideal choice, and
reach a happy ending.

Just as I had defeated the Floating Island to receive EXP and save
Dorothy.

‘And I am curious about her secret as well.’

Alice was someone who knew that the Evil God was going to be revived.

If I figured out how she learned that information and why she decided to
take the Evil God’s side, then it might help with my journey.

That meant it was important to avoid Alice.

But avoiding her at all costs might not be the answer.

“Baby.”

“Yes, let’s go eat it.”

So, I decided to stay with her for a short while.

It didn’t seem like Alice was planning to harm me today.

And even if it seemed like something similar was happening, I could just
run away.

Since I could train my mana mastery with the magic tool I had right now,
I decided to change my planned schedule.

“…I like quick-witted ones like you.”

Alice grinned happily.

\*\*\*

At an outdoor table on the 3rd-floor balcony, under a pretty,
petite-designed parasol.

I was sitting, facing Alice.

For a while, she gazed down with loving eyes at the slice of cake and
cat parfait that was set down on the center of the table.

Then, finally eating a spoonful, she leaned her cheek against her hand
and sank into pure bliss.

The Siren’s Face.

They had a vast menu of delicious dishes along with a cute design,
making it a famous café to visit among female students.

Dorothy had also talked about this place countless times.

“Is it good?”

“Far beyond my expectations. I didn’t know such a place existed.”

“You must not come here often. I heard this place is popular.”

“I’m busy. I’ll be coming here often after I give up my position as
President.”

“…”

Alice would resign from her position as Student Council President once
this semester ended, but she ended her life before that time came.

So in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, she never came back to this café.

“Have you come here with Dorothy before?”

“No, it’s my first time.”

I answered her while taking a bite of the cat parfait.

***It’s good alright.***

I still held the magic tool in my other hand, circulating my mana. It
was challenging, but I had gotten used to it.

With a quiet, “Hmm,” Alice smiled meaningfully.

“That’s unexpected. I thought you would have done all sorts of things
with Dorothy.”

“I am close with Senior Dorothy, but we haven’t been able to have much
fun. I’m training most of the time.”

“You seem to enjoy training.”

Alice peered at the magic tool in my hand.

If someone asked me whether I liked training, I couldn’t answer. I was,
in a way, addicted though.

***Ah, it is nice when I feel a sense of achievement.***

…Nevermind the small talk. I should test Alice’s intentions.

“Actually, Senior Alice.”

“Yes?”

“I heard something on our way here,”

Alice stared at me while continuing to chew the dessert in her mouth.
Her chin was resting on one of her hands.

“You called me because you want me in the Student Council, correct?”

“…”

“If that was also why you suddenly called me for a date, I understand—”

Suddenly, Alice scooped up a spoonful of parfait and popped it into my
mouth as I spoke.

My mouth was filled with tingly sweetness and a faint, slimy texture.

“…?”

I was stunned.

“You’re hasty, Baby.”

“Hmm?”

“It’s a little cold to jump straight to the point, don’t you think?”

Alice pulled out the spoon from my mouth. Her expression remained calm.

I swallowed the parfait that she fed me.

“What you said. It’s half right and half wrong.”

Crossing her arms and legs, Alice leaned against the chair.

The way she crossed her arms accentuated her already large chest.

“It is true that I want to recruit you into the Student Council. But
you, Baby, don’t intend to do so.”

“How would you know that?”

“I heard you’ve turned down the offer to enter the Four Constellations.
Not only that but you’re known to just study and train all day. Though,
I do think rumors of you dating the second-year top seat are false.
Anyway, I know you aren’t the type to immerse yourself in student
council work.”

“Well, that’s about right.”

“But I have taken a liking to you.”

“…?”

“I have a good eye for people, you see.”

Alice grinned, pointing at her eye.

She said that it was half right and half wrong that she wanted to
recruit me into the Student Council.

***Then what did she call me to suggest?***

“So, Baby.”

Alice pointed at me with her spoon.

“Why don’t you make a bet with me?”

***Why a bet all of a sudden?***

“What bet?”

“Whether Baby will come to love me or not.”

“…?”

***…What sort of bet is that? How are you supposed to know how I
feel?***

There wasn’t a single bit of objectiveness included in the bet.

“If you come to like me, become my subordinate. How’s that?”

I was so dumbfounded that I laughed.

“…What if I just don’t express it?”

“Then I’ll make sure you can’t help but express it.”

Alice responded to my question as if the answer was obvious, then bit
the spoon that had entered my mouth.

Well, she would have also received a lot of confessions. Moreover, she
believed it was only natural to be considered pretty, so she was
probably confident in herself as well.

Whether they know it or not, the pretty and handsome students tend to
receive confessions from many other students. I had heard that was also
the case for Luce, Kaya, and Dorothy.

‘That reminds me, I haven’t received any confessions yet.’

***I thought this Isaac was on the handsome side, so what’s the
problem…?***

…Whatever. It was meaningless anyway.

“Do you really want me that much?”

“Yeah.”

Alice nodded her head casually.

She spoke without hesitation, didn’t she? I almost questioned whether or
not she thought things through before speaking.

But if someone heard such a thing from such a pretty student like Alice,

It was clear that most male students’ hearts would have begun to
flutter, regardless of their will.

That would have also been the case for me if I hadn’t known Alice’s true
nature.

‘Of course, this is likely a trap.’

It would be easy to keep an eye on me if I became her subordinate.

Not to mention, if I fell in love with Alice, then it was likely that
just a few right words from her would make me confess my secrets. Since,
on the surface, it was impossible for the Nameless Hero to know that
Alice was the enemy. That would be a massive stab in the back.

Even if it wasn’t revealed that I was the Nameless Hero, I was a
talented student that the Student Council would openly welcome. This was
a winning bet for Alice.

But the question was…

‘Why would she choose a bet that would only come out in romance dramas
out of all things…?’

I cringed internally.

However, her confident attitude did help lessen the impact.

The more I thought about it, the only thought I arrived at was, “What
sort of stupid bet is this?”

Back during the Trial of Frost, Phantom Cat Cheshire had said that I was
Alice’s type.

A familiar knew their master’s heart the best. That meant my outer
appearance was closely identical to Alice’s ideal type.

This was why I thought for a moment that the bet might contain some
personal feelings.

But after remembering her true colors that I had seen in ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱, I shook my head immediately.

Instead, she was closer to a Nepenthes that lured the opponent to their
demise with a sweet scent.^1^ED Min Note: A Nepenthes is a carnivorous
plant in the form of a pitcher (Think the Bellsprout line if you know
Pokemon). They release a sweet scent so insects will enter their body
and then they close the lid to digest them.

“So, for now, I wanted to suggest something that aligns with your
current situation.”

With her kind signature smile, Alice tilted her head slightly to the
side.

***Something in line with my situation?***

“What is it?”

“How about you become an Honorary Student Council Member?”

“…?”

I couldn’t understand what her suggestion meant.

Chapter 164: Bet (4)
====================

**༺ Bet (4) ༻**

“Honorary Student Council Member?”

It was a setting I saw in the third year of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

I didn’t expect to hear about it so soon.

Had it already been introduced?

“In an emergency, you get the authority of the student council. There’s
no need to worry about student council duties; just act when necessary.
In exchange, Baby, you’ll have the obligation to protect the students
and the academy.”

“I’ve never heard of it before.”

“It’s something the Headmistress approved this year. Since it hasn’t
been officially announced yet, it’s natural you haven’t heard of it.”

That made sense. It was about time for it to be introduced.

‘Honorary Student Council Member… Sounds quite good, doesn’t it?’

In all sorts of scenarios that occurred in Year 2, if one could act with
the authority of the student council and the responsibility to protect
the students…

If I get caught up in an incident, I wouldn’t have to worry about being
suspected.

In other words.

‘It actually becomes more convenient.’

Not only the authority of the student council, but even the duties could
be useful to me.

In the scenarios and sub-events of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, it would
become significantly easier to act according to my plan.

“Honorary Student Council Member is half the duties of the student
council, so you can enjoy about half of the student council benefits.
You’ll even receive a scholarship.”

Even a scholarship.

‘It’s quite a privilege…’

The authority given only in “emergency situations” was a bit limiting.

Those “emergency situations” also included times when I had to act as
the Nameless Hero.

Of course, when Year 2 started, the frequency of demon appearance
drastically decreased, so it might be okay. The strategy of the Evil God
changed from spamming out demons to sporadically sending out stronger
ones.

Therefore, the issue was whether my actions would be constrained by
Alice’s commands.

“So, does that mean, in an emergency, I have to follow Senior’s orders?”

“No, that’s up to you.”

***That’s unexpected.***

“You don’t need to follow my orders as an Honorary Student Council
Member. Again, your only duty is to protect the academy and its
students. If you don’t want to continue, you can quit anytime.”

It didn’t seem bad.

No, it was a very sweet offer.

It might have been a trap set by Alice, but no matter how I examined
what she said, it turned out to be advantageous for me.

Just as I reached that conclusion, Alice raised her index finger and
added, “However.”

“There’s a condition.”

As expected, there it was. That was reassuring.

If it was going to be an offer that only benefitted me, it would make me
feel uncomfortable and resist it as if it were a scam.

“What’s the condition?”

“Occasionally go on a date with me.”

Correction. It seemed like a scam.

“We’re in the middle of a bet. I think it’s only fair that you give me a
chance too.”

Alice mumbled after taking a spoonful of parfait.

‘I haven’t accepted the bet yet.’

She was advancing the conversation on her own.

***Isn’t she jumping the gun?***

Seeing me silent, Alice tilted her head and prodded, “Isn’t that right?”

“Yeah… that’s true.”

Well, I wasn’t planning on refusing the bet anyway.

There likely wasn’t any trick Alice could use to harm me through the bet
itself.

On the contrary, it might be opportunity to uncover her secrets.

Anyway, it seemed like Alice had decided to use her charm as a strategy.

Knowing her true nature, I found it hard to adapt to this approach.

“How about it? Want to try being an Honorary Student Council Member?”

“That is… Thanks for the offer, but I’ll need to think about it.”

I replied with a polite smile.

If I had rashly agreed to be an Honorary Student Council Member, I might
have regretted it later. Now was the time to step back and think.

\*\*\*

“We can’t be together for long. I have a meeting later.”

Alice looked at the tall clock tower and said that to me. We were
walking on a bridge crossing the lake together.

It was a place densely lined with many flowers. Various potted plants
hung on the railing, and their leafy vines stretched down.

Among them, Alice seemed like a beautiful rose.

It was as though touching her for her beauty could result in one being
pricked by thorns.

“Did you have a meeting?”

I asked, looking at Alice’s back.

“Yes.”

“I thought we would be together until the evening at the very least.”

“That must be disappointing. Not being able to spend more time with me.”

“That’s not it…”

I never intended to spend much time with Alice anyway. I was planning to
leave soon, as I couldn’t postpone my training.

A brief silence followed.

The sound of crickets, occasionally accompanied by the splash of fish in
the water, could be heard.

Then, I opened my mouth. There was something I wanted to ask Alice.

“Senior Alice.”

“Yes, Baby?”

“What will you do if I win the bet?”

“If you win?”

“If you fall for me first. We haven’t talked about what happens if I
win.”

“I never thought about losing.”

***What kind of bet is that?***

“Hmm.”

Alice pondered with her head down for a moment, then suddenly looked at
me with a mischievous smile.

“Even if that happens, how will you notice? I’m confident in not showing
it.”

“Then I’ll make sure you can’t help but express it.”

When I repeated her words back to her, she chuckled softly.

“That’s funny. Well… if I lose, you can do whatever you want to me,
Baby.”

Alice said this with a smile and then turned around.

‘She said I can do as I please…’

Did she truly not even consider the possibility of losing?

***Really…***

Her answer left much to the imagination.

\* \* \*

Verga Rayphelt, a muscular male student with dark green hair, walked
through a corridor of the Magic Department.

His imposing presence alone drew the attention of all the students
there.

He was known for his large stature, even among the students of the
Knight Department.

Among the Magic Department students, who focused more on magical than
physical training, he stood out noticeably.

“You.”

“Y-yes…!”

In the second-year corridor.

When Verga placed his hand on the shoulder of the second-year male
student and spoke, the male student was extremely startled.

“Tell me where Isaac is.”

Verga spoke in a commanding tone.

He had just come from checking the second-year Class B classroom. It was
completely empty.

“I-I don’t know… I’m not close with Isaac…”

“…Useless guy.”

Verga pushed the student aside and hastened his steps.

In the wide corridor, the student’s body rolled helplessly on the floor
twice. He was terrified but felt an intense relief that the situation
passed without further harm.

The aggressor was Verga Rayphelt, an elite member of the Black Tigers
and a hunter of the Magic Department.

Ordinary magic didn’t work on that man. His defense was exceptional.

There were hardly any here who could wield magic that could penetrate
his defenses.

Moreover, Verga was infamous for his ferocious temperament. Having
witnessed him pushing the student just now, the others could truly sense
his notorious reputation.

“And you? Do you know where Isaac is?”

“I-I don’t know… Aaah!”

“Tch.”

Verga, without sparing the female student, roughly pushed her aside.

Her frail body collided lifelessly with the window. She grimaced and
groaned, clutching her shoulder.

“Isaac!! If you’re here, come out now!!”

Verga’s deep voice resounded thunderously through the second-year
corridor.

“I am Verga Rayphelt!! I’ve come to duel with you again!! Come out in
front of me right now, Isaac!!”

His suppressed feelings of anger poured out through his words.

“Um, excuse me…”

“…What is it?”

When a female student courageously spoke up, Verga glared at her with
eyes like a wild beast.

The female student, suddenly startled, broke out into a cold sweat.

“Ah, Isaac, he… was called by the Student Council President earlier…”

“The Student Council President…?”

The Student Council President, Alice Carroll. One of the main powers of
Märchen Academy.

***She’s looking for Isaac? Why?***

The thought that came to mind was a student council recruitment offer.

If he was called by the Student Council President, there seemed to be no
other reason than that.

“Isaac, that guy…”

In the student council?

“How audacious.”

The idea of Isaac, who would be utterly defeated in a proper duel with
him, joining the student council was almost laughable.

Well, it wasn’t like his skills were too poor, and he did have a pretty
face, almost like a girl’s.

Verga thought that Alice intended to use him like a slave.

“Is that guy in the student council room right now?”

“That, I’m not sure…”

Verga clicked his tongue in annoyance and moved on.

Students in the corridor stepped aside to make way. Verga walked through
the cleared path as if it were expected.

He headed towards Bartos Hall, the center of academic administration.

He couldn’t enter the student council room, but by lingering around
Bartos Hall, he might encounter Isaac.

It was then.

“…?”

A blond male student blocked Verga’s path.

Verga stopped and glared threateningly at him.

It seemed like he was intentionally blocking the way.

“…Who are you?”

As Verga asked in a deep, annoyed voice, the blond male student silently
deployed a light green magic circle.

*Whooosh──.*

*Wham──!*

A strong force of mana rushed in like a fierce wind.

Verga’s eyes widened as he reflexively assumed a combat stance.

“It’s you…”

The blond male student, Tristan Humphrey, a second-year from the Magic
Department.

He glared at Verga with a face full of anger.

However, his voice was notably low.

“What’s the reason for pushing around my subordinate?”

The male student Verga had initially pushed around was…

One of the self-proclaimed subordinates who had been flattering and
following Tristan since the first year.

He was someone who had already received the favor of Tristan.

After witnessing that student being pushed by Verga, veins throbbed
fiercely on Tristan’s forehead.

“Hmph! Insolent little wizard, daring to use a magic circle in front of
me…!”

“I know who you are. Verga Rayphelt, an elite member of the Black
Tigers.”

Tristan walked leisurely to the side and flung open the closed windows.
The tense students quickly distanced themselves from them.

Tristan turned his head, narrowed his eyes, and glared at Verga.

“You want to duel Isaac again? Ha! Do you want to repeat your last
defeat? It was truly pitiful last time!”

“This… this brat… How dare you spout such nonsense!!”

Last semester, the fact that Verga had been defeated by Isaac was like a
sore spot for him.

Even though he was causing a commotion in Orphin Hall, he had intended
to fight in the dueling arena.

Excited at the thought of avenging his humiliation from last semester,
Verga ultimately fell for Tristan’s provocation.

*Swoosh─!*

Verga clenched his fist and, pushing off the ground, leaped towards
Tristan.

A speed that transcended his bulky frame.

But at that moment, a fierce wind whipped through the corridor.

*Whooooooosh────!!*

“…!!”

At the sound of the wind, Tristan’s figure instantly disappeared from
Verga’s view.

*Bang───!!*

“Ugh!!”

Suddenly, Verga felt a blow to the side of his head as if struck by a
club, taking the full brunt of the mana from the wind explosion.

A direct hit. Verga’s large body was flung helplessly through the window
that Tristan had opened.

In the middle of the corridor, Tristan, wrapped in wind mana, was
retracting his extended leg.

He had left the window open in anticipation of this situation.

No matter how angry he might have been.

He foresaw that there would be property damage. He simply couldn’t allow
it since it would go against his values.

“Phew!”

*Whoom─!*

Verga regained his posture mid-air and landed on the ground with both
legs, a thunderous impact sound echoed.

Verga’s sturdy body was unscathed even by such a fall.

However, his head was spinning. Blood poured from his nose and mouth,
despite being wrapped in \[Basic Protection Magic\]…

Though he had been excited and let his guard down, Verga couldn’t help
but feel dismayed.

It was a moment when his highly praised defense seemed like a useless
thing. Just moments ago, Tristan’s attack had demonstrated tremendous
power.

Verga had no way of knowing that Tristan’s attacks had even been
effective against a powerhouse like the Diamond Paladin.

*Whoooosh───!*

“…!!”

As the strong wind rushed in, Verga hastily drew his double-handed axe
from his back, trying to counterattack.

However, by that time, Tristan’s knee had already slammed into his face.

In terms of speed, Tristan was far above Verga.

*Bang───!!*

The sound of air splitting and a shockwave. A loud boom.

The knee strike infused with wind mana.

The explosion of the condensed wind mana engulfed Verga all at once.

Several teeth were knocked out, and his face momentarily caved in.

Tristan, riding the wind, lightly landed on the ground.

Verga weakly dropped his double-handed axe and clutched his broken nose
and bloodied face, collapsing onto the ground.

Verga groaned in pain, “Uuurrgh…” rolling on the floor.

Students in Orphin Hall watched the confrontation between Tristan and
Verga through the windows, swallowing nervously.

“Pathetic. Groaning over this much.”

Tristan withdrew the wind mana that enveloped his body and looked
scornfully at Verga.

“Isaac, that damn guy, is stronger than me. With you whining like this,
you stand no chance against him.”

Verga’s eyes widened in shock.

More than the physical pain, it was Tristan’s words that plunged him
into deeper shock.

“Fool… Know your place.”

Tristan clicked his tongue in disdain, turned his back on Verga, and
left.

All that remained was a heavy silence.

Chapter 165: Bet — Interlude
============================

**༺ Bet – Interlude ༻**

It seemed like today’s events were vividly etched in my memory.

While feeling tense, I had difficulty understanding Alice Carroll’s
intentions. It was quite exhausting.

I parted with Alice without any issues. She didn’t seem to have any
tricks up her sleeve for me, nor did she subtly interrogate me.

‘Is it build-up?’

Could it be a process of building a foundation to corner me?

For now… I knew too little about Alice.

Perhaps because she was an enemy to fight against the player, it felt
like her portrayal in the game was restrained.

Dorothy, who sacrificed herself using the 9-star spell \[Last Light of a
Dying Star\] in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

At least from the beginning, she gave hints of “I’m going to die”,
allowing us to glimpse fragments of her mind.

For example,

Dorothy’s empty room… It indirectly allowed the player to understand her
gradual acceptance of death.

On the other hand,

‘There was no implication that Alice would commit suicide.’

Alice, unlike Dorothy, was a character who never exposed her heart at
all.

Because of that, I had no clue how to approach her.

I couldn’t fathom what was truly in Alice’s heart, from start to finish.

***Does she also want to travel to beautiful places?***

***Does she want to experience love?***

***Does she have dreams?***

“…”

I shook my head.

Such thoughts were a luxury.

Anyway, Alice desired the death of Ian Fairytale, the being who posed
the greatest threat to the Evil God.

Regardless of her circumstances, that fact remained unchanged.

As for me,

In order to defeat the Evil God in my third year, I just needed to
extract whatever benefits I could from her.

In that context, it was necessary to delve into Alice’s personal
affairs, as they could also be beneficial to me. Of course, I was also
genuinely curious.

The sky was glowing with the hue of sunset. It was evening.

In a corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

While I was sitting on a stump, lost in thought, Princess Snow White and
her escort knight, Merlin Astrea, arrived.

I stood up to greet them.

“Hello, Whi-“

“Senior Isaac!!”

“Hmm?”

***What’s this all of a sudden? Why the sudden shouting?***

White came running over with a surprised face.

“Puhah!”

Then, White fell forcefully in front of me, collapsing to the ground.

That must have hurt.

“Princess White!”

“Ugh…”

Merlin rushed over, and White groaned in pain as she slowly raised her
upper body.

I bent over and reached out my hand to White.

“Are you okay? Are you hurt?”

“I’m okay… *sniffle*.”

I helped White up and brushed off the dirt on her pure white hair and
uniform.

She tried to act okay, but tears welled up in White’s eyes.

She seemed to be in a lot of pain.

Merlin scolded, “Please be careful! You’ll hurt yourself!” but…

White just apologized, saying, “I’m sorry…”

Her voice was faltering due to her sniffles.

“More importantly, Senior Isaac! I heard that you joined the student
council?!”

The rumor had even reached the first years.

‘That makes sense.’

Erin called me out too noticeably in the middle of the corridor of
Orphin Hall.

And since I was seen walking around academy grounds with Alice Carroll…
It would have been odd if rumors didn’t spread.

Moreover, through the mouths of the students, the news of me being
summoned by the Student Council President turned into false information
that “Isaac joined the student council”.

“Also, an elite member of the Black Tiger? I heard such a strong person
came looking for you, Senior Isaac!”

An elite member of the Black Tiger?

The only Black Tiger I was involved with was Verga Rayphelt. Did he come
looking for me?

“That person was shouting in Orphin Hall, calling for you, Senior Isaac,
to come out for a duel…! Then, I heard he got defeated by a second-year
senior! I wonder what happened?”

“…?”

‘There’s nothing like this in the game.’

…However, that didn’t surprise me.

The content of the game I knew was merely for reference.

With the variable “me” involved, it was not strange for unexpected
situations to occur and for things to go awry.

***But, Verga was defeated?***

“This is the first I’ve heard of it. Explain in detail.”

“I don’t know the details either. I only heard bits and pieces. I didn’t
expect you, Senior Isaac, to not know about it either…”

“…Alright. I’ll ask someone I know later.”

It was a waste of time to pry for details from someone who didn’t know
much.

I decided to ask a friend later. Since the situation seemed to have been
resolved without my knowledge, there was no need to dwell on it too
much.

“And no, I didn’t join the student council. I was just called by the
Student Council President.”

“Ah. Then why were you called?”

I briefly explained to White that I was proposed to become an “Honorary
Student Council Member”.

“Honorary Student Council Member… I didn’t know that existed. But Senior
Isaac, you totally deserve such an offer. You are really capable!”

White seemed relieved after hearing my story.

“I was worried when I heard that you joined the student council… I
wondered what would happen.”

“Why?”

“If you become busy, we won’t be able to see each other as often…”

I was White’s ideal mentor. It made sense that she didn’t want to lose
me.

Of course, it was not just about calculating benefits. White was
attached to me. She considered me the most trustworthy person in this
academy.

Well, hearing her say that made me feel good.

“Is that so.”

When I smiled broadly, White also smiled faintly.

***That’s it for now.***

I quickly shifted my expression as I lifted my round glasses, a dramatic
change based on my acting skills.

“By the way, about the assignment I gave you before? The five types of
\[Wind Sword\] magic circles you were supposed to memorize.”

“Uh… heh… heh…”

An awkward laugh.

Lacking confidence, White avoided my gaze and broke into a cold sweat.

“…Let’s see it.”

White hesitated, then began to display light green magic circles one by
one in the air.

…Three of them were quite decent, but the construction of the remaining
two took a long time, and their lines were a mess.

“Haa.”

White withdrew the magic circles and hung her head in apparent shame.

“You didn’t memorize them all. I thought I gave you enough time.”

I narrowed my eyes and glared at White.

“White.”

“Yes, yes, Senior Isaac…!”

“I’ve told you time and time again how important it is to know how to
add and adjust lines on basic magic circles, as it expands the range of
tactics. Among them, \[Wind Sword\] is one of the most versatile, and
it’s closely related to the 5-star magic, \[Gale Fang\]. Memorizing the
shapes of magic circles is a fundamental skill. The application of them
comes later. That’s why I asked you to memorize the five most useful
primary shapes first…”

“I-I’m so sorry!”

After my long reprimand, White quickly bowed her upper body in a hasty
apology.

“Explain. Why didn’t you memorize them all?”

“I was too sleepy yesterday! I think I ate… a bit too much for dinner
and dessert…”

She was honest.

Smart. Lying in front of me would be immediately noticeable. It seems
White had learned from past experiences.

“Alright. Since you didn’t complete the assignment properly, as
promised, I’m moving up the due date of the debt.”

“What? Then…?”

“You have one month left.”

“…!”

White looked up at me, her face filled with shock.

“Let me reiterate, if you don’t pay off the debt by the due date,
regardless of your promise to take responsibility, I will end the
mentoring. If you work hard, you can earn enough gels to pay off the
debt by then. If you can’t, it’s only because you’ve been negligent.
There’d be no reason for me to continue teaching you.”

“…”

***It’s obviously a lie.***

Whether White paid her debt or not, I intended to continue mentoring her
anyway. I just wanted to prevent her from being lazy and to maintain a
sense of urgency.

“So, if you want to continue with me, work harder…”

***Uh… Is she about to cry?***

“Senior Isaac…”

Her voice was on the verge of tears.

I was flustered.

“Wait, White?”

“I’ll pay off all the debt, so please don’t leave…! I like you a lot,
Senior Isaac…! Waaah…”

“Ah, no… I was too harsh. Sorry…!”

…I needed to cultivate more empathy.

\* \* \*

\[Why did you make such a bet with Isaac, Alice?\]

The sunset light from outside the window penetrated the student council
room.

Alice Carroll sat in the Student Council President’s chair, gazing at
the distant sky, feeling the cool breeze coming through the open window.
She held a teacup filled with black tea in her hands.

The plump cat magic beast with a small fedora, Phantom Cat Cheshire, sat
on the sofa, looking at Alice with a smiling face.

\[You wouldn’t have suddenly developed an interest in romance. Could you
tell me what you’re thinking?\]

Phantom Cat Cheshire asked in a strange voice.

“Indeed. Want to take a guess?”

Alice replied playfully and took a sip of her tea.

Cheshire paused with a, “Huh?”

It then let out a strange, eerie laugh.

\[A riddle! That sounds interesting!\]

Caught off-guard by the unexpected riddle, Cheshire grinned broadly,
lost in thought. It found the idea of guessing the answer quite
entertaining.

Alice, ignoring the foolish familiar, took another sip of her tea.

\[Ah!\]

Eventually, Cheshire laughed as if it had an epiphany.

\[So you can keep a closer eye on Isaac?\]

“Close enough.”

\[I’m a genius!\]

Cheshire wobbled its protruding belly, dancing with joy.

\[But Alice, what if you develop affection for Isaac?\]

“That’s a pointless question.”

\[I think it’s an interesting question. What if you really fall for
Isaac, and he turns out to be the Black Monster, and you have the
perfect opportunity to kill him…! What will you do? How will you kill
him?\]

“…”

\[Will you cut his throat? Pierce his heart? Kill him with as little
pain as possible? Or just leave him barely alive so he won’t be a
nuisance…? No, you have to kill him. Yes, you should. It’s right to kill
him. Then will you cry? Grieve? Laugh in resignation? Will you answer
me, Alice?\]

Alice, almost unconsciously, gently fiddled with the black choker around
her neck.

Due to endlessly scratching at it, the soft choker now felt slightly
rough to the touch.

“…Well, who knows.”

Alice uttered that one sentence, mixed with her breath, and then quietly
removed her hand from the choker.

\* \* \*

I had a conversation with the subordinates of Mateo, whom I was close
to.

Verga Rayphelt appeared in Orphin Hall looking for me but apparently got
severely beaten by Tristan Humphrey. The fight broke out because Tristan
took issue with Verga messing with his subordinates.

Unexpectedly, Tristan scored an overwhelming victory over Verga.

‘Was he really at that level?’

Tristan was known to be a hard worker with exceptional skills, but it
felt odd to hear that he could already overpower Verga.

Anyway,

Fighting outside the sparring arena was a clear violation of academy
rules, but Tristan and Verga did not receive severe punishment.

Students who witnessed the situation defended Tristan by submitting
petitions.

The incident was lightly concluded with a few penalty points since
Tristan and Verga reconciled and settled the matter amicably.

Of course, that reconciliation was probably not sincere on either part.

It was said that Verga was disheartened for some reason, leading to a
smooth resolution.

Due to the few penalty points, Tristan looked sour all day, his face was
filled with dissatisfaction and regret.

Trying to make up for the penalty points, he volunteered first when a
professor needed help, driven by an obsession to achieve good grades.

Since his current goal was me, he didn’t want to fall behind.

“Haa.”

Anyway, let’s set that aside.

In a corner of the Butterfly Garden, I pulled up all my mana and shot a
cold pale blue blast into the sky, which blossomed beautifully.

With the use of defrost, my ice magic crumbled into powder, falling like
snowflakes.

In the cold breeze caused by the ice mana, my sigh turned into a white
smoke-like cloud, flowing out from my mouth.

“Wow…!”

In front of the oak tree,

Dorothy, a girl with light purple hair wearing a witch’s hat, cheered.

I felt a surge of accomplishment and excitement. I wanted to satisfy my
desire to show off. Luckily, there was someone there to witness it.

I grinned and gave Dorothy a “V” sign with my index and middle finger, a
sign of achievement.

“Did you see that clearly? Now I can handle 6-star spells with ease.”

“Hehehe. Yes, I saw it clearly! Well done, President!”

Dorothy cheered me on, giving a thumbs-up.

6-star ice spell, \[Frost Glitter\].

6-star ice spell, \[Frost Wave\].

I had finally reached the level where I could properly utilize these
spells.

Only two days were left until my duel with Miya.

<span id="0164_166_Fury_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 166: Fury (1)
=====================

**༺ Fury (1) ༻**

“Shera, throw the trash in the trash can properly.”

*“Sob.”*

“Right now.”

“Ugh, you blockhead…”

During the day, the Spade Paladin, who was walking through the grounds
of Märchen Academy, scolded the Heart Paladin, Shera Hectolica, who was
beside him.

To him, who adhered to the rules, Shera’s act of littering on the street
was unacceptable.

“This place will disappear anyways, what does it matter if one or two
pieces of trash are thrown on the street.”

“Shera. We are students…”

“Okay, okay\~. Seriously, you will never date a woman in your life.”

“Hey, what do you mean by that?”

Shera, with a look of disgust, picked up the paper trash she had thrown
away and put it in the trash can.

Then she took out a mana pudding bar from her pocket, tore open the
wrapper, and took a bite. She still had a displeased expression on her
face.

“Model citizen leader. Do you think ‘that guy’ will pop out during the
duel evaluation? As Her Majesty mentioned.”

“…You mean the ‘Shadow Demon’?”

“Yeah, that.”

According to the information shared by Alice, that demon was lying low,
waiting for the right time to appear.

After the joint practical evaluation, it had been a series of boring
day-to-day life, so Shera wished for the Shadow Demon to appear soon and
provide some excitement.

However, the Spade Paladin’s response immediately deflated Shera.

“It won’t happen.”

The Spade Paladin lifted his glasses with his gloved hand. In his own
way, it was a movement that exuded intelligence.

“It doesn’t seem like the Priestess will go berserk anytime soon.”

“So booooring…”

Shera pouted her lips and grumbled.

\*\*\*

─‘My goal is Luce, after all.’

Isaac’s words lingered in her mind.

In the Magic Department, Orphin Hall.

Only the darkness of the evening sky hung over the first-year Class D
classroom.

Sitting still in the middle of the empty classroom, Snow White, the pure
white princess, had been staring intently at the duel request ticket for
some time.

Snow White recalled Isaac’s words. He had received a duel request from
Miya, the first-year top seat and Priestess, yet showed no sign of fear.

Instead, he showed determination, stating that his goal was Luce
Eltania, who was even stronger than Miya.

‘Senior Isaac is so cool.’

If she had to duel with Priestess Miya, she would certainly feel a
strong fear first.

‘Could I also become like Senior Isaac…’

To become someone who stood shoulder to shoulder with Priestess Miya and
Saintess Bianca Anturaze, To become friends with them, and ultimately
contribute to the peace of the Zelver Empire.

That was White’s purpose in Märchen Academy.

Then, how should she use this remaining request ticket in the upcoming
duel evaluation…

“…”

It was time to end her deliberations.

White stood up from her seat.

\*\*\*

“Hooooo, haaaa…”

“Princess White, are you alright?”

“Yes, I’m already full of determination…!”

The next day. The day before the duel evaluation.

Snow White, pouring out cold sweat, steadied her breath.

Her appearance was so tense that even just looking at her would make one
sweat.

In front of the academic building, White and Merlin Astrea were hiding
behind a row of trees.

The first-year top seat of the Magic Department, Priestess Miya, with
her black jade-colored hair flowing down, was walking towards them.
White, placing her hand on her chest, took a deep breath and nodded at
Merlin.

Her face set with determination.

White moved resolutely and stopped in front of Priestess Miya, who was
walking along the path.

“…?”

Miya stopped in her tracks when White suddenly appeared.

The warm sunshine shone down on the two beautiful female students.

White’s face was full of tension, and Miya’s face was clouded with
questions. The two students seemed to be divided as black and white.

Like a teenager who was about to confess, White trembled. Miya waited
for her to speak.

“H… h-h-he… Hey…!”

White managed to part her lips, but her voice quivered as if broken.

Merlin, who was hidden behind the tree, was silently cheering ‘You can
do it!’.

Gathering her courage, White pulled something out from within her
clothing to show Miya.

Her hands trembled as if there had been an earthquake.

White’s serious-looking face and cold sweat, along with the duel request
ticket in her hand, came into Miya’s view.

Miya tilted her head, seemingly not understanding the situation.

“Miya, I challenge you to a duel…!”

Passing students were shocked to see the princess pulling out a duel
request ticket towards the Priestess.

Even putting aside the fact it was a princess versus a Priestess, the
situation of the last in the grade challenging the top seat was shocking
enough.

“…Pfft.”

Miya let out a scoff.

“What’s the scheme?”

“S-scheme? No, it’s not like that. Just…!”

White looked straight into Miya’s eyes and exclaimed,

“You are my goal…!”

Only one day was left before the duel evaluation.

Isaac had achieved dramatic growth yesterday by fully mastering two
6-star magic spells.

He always pushed himself relentlessly and achieved exponential growth in
the end.

Then, as his mentee, she couldn’t just stand here doing nothing.

She couldn’t become like her senior if she continued to show cowardly
behavior.

Snow White’s goal was to become close to Saintess Bianca Anturaze and
Priestess Miya, to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.

Therefore, she decided to challenge herself by dueling with Miya, the
strongest student in the first year, and her goal.

***To become stronger…! She mustn’t hesitate to fight strong opponents
like Isaac does.***

And if she was lucky, this could be an opportunity to become closer to
Miya. White gathered her courage with this thought.

White and Miya looked into each other’s eyes silently.

After a moment of contemplation, Miya let out a slight smile.

“Okay, I accept.”

“…!”

A glimmer shone in White’s eyes.

Despite the situation of the last in class challenging the first, White
couldn’t hide her surprise that Miya had accepted the challenge.

Miya approached White and whispered, “I look forward to it, Snow White,”
in her ear, and then left the spot.

With her face flushed and a bright smile, White clenched her fist and
quietly cheered.

White was very happy just with the fact that Miya had accepted her
request for a duel.

\* \* \*

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ sub-event, “Blazing Petals.”

Ian Fairytale had definitely received the duel request from Priestess
Miya, so the player couldn’t avoid that sub-event. Strictly speaking, it
wasn’t much different from the main scenario.

Naturally, our protagonist Ian couldn’t beat Miya. The difference in
their abilities and the power of their familiars was too great.

However, Ian won in the sub-event. The reason was simple.

‘Because Miya let her guard down.’

Miya, trying to gauge Ian’s skills, held back and was suddenly overcome.

It was Ian’s incredible physical ability and bursting strike that
ultimately caused her to be defeated.

It was the common cliché for a strong opponent to underestimate the
protagonist and then be defeated.

However, the cost of such a victory was severe burns and two days in the
hospital, but a win was a win. He was easily healed with magic as soon
as the duel ended.

Moreover, Ian, having the constitution to hold the light element, also
had monstrous regenerative powers.

***Of course, I am not Ian.***

Meaning, it was uncertain whether Miya would underestimate me and hold
back as she did in the sub-event “Blazing Petals.”

‘She’ll… probably hold back?’

Considering Miya’s behavior and speech on the day of the entrance exam,
when she underestimated me.

As I was thinking about the upcoming duel with Miya, something
unexpected happened.

“She accepted the duel?”

“Yes.”

In the evening, in a corner of the Hydrangea Garden.

White, who had been repeatedly practicing wind magic, said with an
excited voice.

Since it was the day before the duel evaluation, I didn’t ask her to do
anything strenuous. She was just lightly reviewing what she had been
taught so far.

Meanwhile, I clicked my tongue at White’s story. It was about how she
had challenged Miya to a duel earlier that day, and Miya had accepted.

***Was there originally a duel between Miya and White in ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱…?***

‘No.’

***Absolutely not. There never was a duel between the two.***

From the beginning, the difference in their skills was too great. It was
like me, in Semester 1 Year 1 facing off against Luce Eltania, who could
fully use the power of the Thunderbird.

“Why did you challenge her to a duel?”

“It’s nothing special, really…”

White stopped using her magic and seemed to hesitate for a moment.

She appeared to be contemplating whether or not to share her thoughts.

Finally, White looked straight at me, as if she had decided to tell her
story.

“You said you would beat Senior Luce. Like you, I wanted to challenge
the Priestess.”

“…”

“That’s why I’ve been deliberating until today. Wondering if someone
like me could even do that.”

White smiled awkwardly.

“You are… like a mentor to me. Being around you, I want to become like
you. Maybe it’s something inevitable? When you see something amazing,
you can’t help but want to imitate it, to aspire to it…”

I was about to say it was still a reckless act, but I held back.

It was clear that White had her own determination to challenge Miya. As
for my thoughts on her decision…

I didn’t want to be overly critical.

And…

“…Is that so?”

“Ehehe.”

Feeling somewhat embarrassed by White’s words, I lifted my glasses and
shyly looked away. White giggled playfully at my reaction.

Unlike other Imperials, this princess showed not even a hint of
authoritarian tendencies.

She was pure, kind, and a bit of a klutz. That made her even more
comfortable to be around, and it was impossible not to grow fond of her.

Knowing that all her words were sincere inevitably made me feel good.

But what concerned me was…

‘The Priestess is the problem.’

I composed my face and thought.

The current Priestess was a sociopath.

A bad kind of sociopath, different from Luce who only focuses on me and
ignores others.

She committed misdeeds without feeling even a pang of guilt.

She treated people like trash, trampled on them, and discriminated based
on class and inherent mana, among other things.

She was definitely a scoundrel, focused on displaying the superiority of
herself and her country, Horan.

Since she was the top seat, there was nothing to gain from dueling
White, who was at the bottom.

In other words, there might be a reason other than the pure purpose of
the duel evaluation for accepting White’s challenge.

‘Like what ‘that kid’ had experienced…’

A sense of foreboding creeps in.

“Whi-“

“Senior Isaac.”

White extended her palm towards me.

“Let’s do our best tomorrow! I’ll give it my all too!”

White was resolute. Seeing her unwavering, pure smile, I closed my mouth
again.

“…It’s not my place to question or intervene.”

The decision to duel Miya was entirely White’s choice.

***It’s her own story that White is cultivating.***

***All I need to do is to observe.***

“Make sure you put to use what you’ve learned.”

“Of course!”

I smiled and high-fived White.

The sound echoed crisply through the air.

\*\*\*

The next day.

The duel evaluation began.

<span id="0165_167_Fury_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 167: Fury (2)
=====================

**༺ Fury (2) ༻**

“We will now begin the first and second-year students’ duel evaluation.”

Magic Department dueling grounds.

There were four dome-shaped dueling grounds, and Snow White was sitting
in the audience of one of them.

“Kyaaah! Professor!!”

“Haa, haaa!”

“Professor Fernando, I love you!”

“I just made eye contact!”

With the arrival of Fernando Frost, the handsome, silver-haired
professor in charge of the first-year Magic Department students, the
dueling grounds were filled with the screams of female students.

Professor Fernando only showed indifference. His cold demeanor only
fueled the passion of the female students.

“Be quiet and listen. I will now explain the rules of the duel
evaluation.”

Professor Fernando stood in the middle of the dueling grounds,
explaining the rules of the evaluation through a loudspeaker.

It was the exact same as before.

Surrendering was prohibited within the first minute of the duel. The
duel immediately ended when someone fainted, became unable to fight, or
declared surrender.

*Kaboom───!*

*Fwoosh───!*

Following the referee’s call, students descended from the audience seats
to the dueling grounds and began their duels.

The duels would be concluded with feedback from the judges. Optionally,
the feedback could be received later in the form of a written
evaluation, depending on the student’s wishes.

White had been trembling since waking up in the morning. It had been a
long time since she felt this nervous.

Without knowing, she found herself looking at Isaac, her senior with
silver-blue hair sitting in another audience seat. He, with Zhonya’s
Staff slung over his shoulder, was observing the dueling grounds when he
noticed White’s gaze and met her eyes.

Isaac waved his hand lightly with a smile, seemingly mouthing, ‘You can
do it’.

Seeing this, White burst into laughter, easing her tension. Indeed,
among the people at the academy, she felt most comfortable and fond of
Senior Isaac.

Eventually,

“First Year Class D, Snow White von Kairos Elfieto. First Year Class A,
Miya. Step forward!”

The referee called.

The students’ attention was instantly drawn. It was a match between two
extremes, the last in the grade versus the top seat.

If that was all there was, everyone would have dismissed the last in
grade as foolish, but the fact that she was the princess of the Zelver
Empire piqued everyone’s interest.

“It’s time…”

White looked at Isaac again.

Isaac nodded at her, and White nodded back.

Thus, Snow White, the princess whose name suited her pure white
appearance…

…And Miya, the Priestess with finely cascading black jade-like hair,
descended from the audience to the dueling grounds.

The students murmured among themselves.

Such a skill disparity wouldn’t be good for either side.

The last in grade was bound to lose due to the overwhelming difference
in power, and the top seat wouldn’t gain much even if she won.

However, as long as White could have a proper match with Miya, she
didn’t care about the outcome.

On the dueling grounds.

White showed clear signs of nervousness, while Miya displayed a
confident demeanor.

“The means are unlimited. Surrender is prohibited for the first minute.
If one side faints or cannot fight, the duel ends at that exact moment.
Proceed the duel with respect for each other.”

Upon the referee’s brief explanation, White responded with a “Yes!” and
Miya nodded.

The judges watched the arena with bated breath. The princess of the
Zelver Empire and the Priestess from the Eastern nation, these two
female students were the very cause of a significant stir in the
academy.

“Then, get ready…! Duel start!”

The referee raised his arm to declare the start of the duel and then
stepped back.

The duel with an obvious result began.

Miya, with her arms crossed, showed no movement. She gave no indication
of deploying a magic circle or preparing for combat.

She simply wore a smile.

In contrast, White prepared a light green magic circle in mid-air, ready
to cast magic at any moment.

“Miya, thank you for accepting this duel.”

White said this with a serious expression.

“Here I go…!”

Now was the time to show the results of her relentless daily efforts.

Even if she couldn’t become friends with Miya, she aimed to at least
build a friendly relationship with her.

White was determined to give all she had in this duel.

White extended her right arm towards Miya. The wind element magic circle
began to glow.

The gentle breeze was enhanced with a light green mana, intensifying in
force.

She launched it.

*Whooosh─────!!*

The magic circle unleashed a whirlwind.

The 4-star wind spell, \[Whirlwind\]. Although still at an unrefined
level, she was able to cast it.

It was less powerful than her 3-star magic, \[Wind Sword\], which she
had diligently mastered.

However, it had the advantage of having the widest attack range among
White’s spells.

The light green whirlwind harshly swept across the arena, engulfing
Miya. A transparent protective barrier was deployed around the audience,
shielding them from the effects of White’s magic.

Soon,

*Whoosh───!*

Red flames swirled around, engulfing the wind.

Overwhelming mana. It felt as if gravity had increased several times as
if something heavy was pressing down on her entire body. Fear spread
across White’s face.

Soon, the intense flames devoured White’s wind and erupted in a column
of fire.

4-star fire spell, \[Flame Pillar\].

Within the spiraling column of flames, Miya’s face could be seen, still
smiling.

Miya lightly waved her folded black fan, sending the flame-engulfed
whirlwind flying away.

“…!!”

*Whoo─.*

*Fwoooosh───!!!*

White counterattacked again with \[Whirlwind\], but her spell was easily
devoured by Miya’s flames.

Watching the flames spreading inexorably, White sensed her imminent
defeat.

The disparity in skill was a merciless and harsh reality. There was no
chance for White to do anything but be overwhelmed.

Moreover, White didn’t yet know how to use the 4-star spell, \[Wind
Wall\]. Therefore, she could only focus on her \[Basic Protective
Magic\] that she had applied to her skin and shield her face with her
arms.

It was then.

Whoosh──.

The flames, instead of engulfing White, split apart right in front of
her nose.

The flames spread out in all directions, creating towering walls of
fire.

It seemed intentional as if to block the view of the referee and
audience.

Inside the space crafted by flames, filled with heat so intense it felt
suffocating,

Only White and Miya remained in this isolated space.

Admiration for the skill in manipulating the fire element as if it were
her own limbs was now secondary.

Miya was approaching.

Despite trembling from instinctive fear, White tried her best to
maintain her composure and combat stance. Miya, on the other hand, still
had a relaxed smile on her face.

Miya stopped in front of White.

And then, Miya moved her lips with a smile.

Miya’s voice, mixed with the crackling of the flames, softly conveyed
words White never wanted to hear.

Gradually, a dark shadow fell over White’s face.

She no longer cared about the difficulty in breathing due to the heat,
nor the fear from the overwhelming disparity in power.

Just a few words were enough to ignite an unbearable rage inside the
pure and kind-hearted White.

“…What did you say?”

White abandoned formal speech.

Despite her menacing voice, Miya only responded with a more sly smile.

“Why such a stern face? It’s not like I said anything wrong.”

“…”

“If you want to hear it again, I can repeat it.”

Miya lightly waved her finger.

“Talking about your mother who has gone to heaven and her weak and
pathetic daughter who herself almost got assassinated several times by
her. How can such a princess, having experienced all that, still remain
so weak?”

*Whooooosh────!!*

The anger constricting her chest intensified, and White’s head raced at
blinding speeds.

In an instant, White calculated and constructed three magic circles. For
her, who previously struggled to deploy even one, this was a remarkable
advancement.

Sometimes, overwhelming anger can paradoxically bring calmness. That was
the case for White at that moment.

***Friendship. Peace. Purity. None of that mattered now.***

At that moment, she felt she’d lose her mind if she didn’t land a proper
attack on the black-haired priestess.

*Whoosh──.*

As the wall of flames receded, the dueling grounds was once again fully
visible.

The referee, judges, and the students in the audience all watched the
arena with shocked expressions.

No words came from White’s mouth. She simply continued to unleash her
attacks on Miya.

Drawing upon her mana, again and again.

*Pheew──!!*

*Splash───!!*

The slash of wind, \[Wind Sword\], and the 4-star, \[Whirlwind\],
simultaneously unleashed in a flurry of attacks. This was the maximum
power that White could muster at that moment.

However, the flames produced from Miya’s magic circle easily swallowed
up the spells that contained White’s full power.

It was an expected outcome.

Miya waved her black fan.

Her superior \[Elemental Efficiency\] expanded the range within which
she could deploy her magic circles. Consequently, Miya’s magic circles
formed all around White.

“…!”

*Whooosh──!*

*Kaboom───!*

A fierce attack.

The flames of dense mana mercilessly consumed White.

It was like witnessing an execution by fire.

Screams tore through the air amidst the blazing flames.

Miya, with her fan covering her mouth, listened to White’s agonizing
screams.

As the flames cleared, White, in her charred uniform, collapsed weakly
to her knees.

Although she had managed to protect her hair with wind magic, only parts
of her pure white hair were singed.

Her physical condition was undeniably terrible.

Yet, White clung to consciousness despite the excruciating pain, glaring
fiercely at Miya without losing consciousness.

“It’s nothing.”

Miya had been curious about who White really was, wondering if she might
be a malevolent person behind a facade of kindness.

But now she was certain. White was merely a white, pure human. To Miya,
she was nothing more than a powerless, uninteresting bug, the kind she
despised the most.

Losing interest, Miya looked at White with a bored expression.

“Ready to surrender now?”

Miya, squatting down in front of White, asked this question.

White, gasping for breath and trembling with rage, glared at Miya.

“You’re honestly boring. Ah, if you won’t surrender, how about I strip
you naked right here? That’d be fun, wouldn’t it? Your uniform is a
total mess anyway. It wouldn’t be bad to let everyone here see your
naked body, right…?”

Again, the wind spell, \[Wind Sword\], struck Miya.

It was weak. There was no need for Miya to counter. \[Wind Sword\]
couldn’t even scratch Miya, wrapped in her skilled \[Basic Protective
Magic\].

White’s mana was already revealing its limits due to the consecutive
attacks she had just performed with every ounce of strength she could
muster.

Because of this, even \[Wind Sword\] couldn’t unleash its usual power.

“Are you that angry? Do you hate me now?”

“…”

“Ah… Hair.”

Miya looked down at a few strands of black hair that had fallen to the
floor of the arena and muttered as if spitting out words as if she had
just realized something.

It was right after that.

Miya’s right hand grasped White’s hair, and her left hand pressed
against her abdomen.

*Kaboom──!!*

“Ugh!!”

Miya repeatedly condensed and exploded fire magic with her left hand,
which was pressed against White’s abdomen.

With her hair grasped, White’s body was immobilized, forced to endure
the full brunt of Miya’s magic.

“This damned woman…!”

Veins throbbed on Miya’s forehead, her expression a mix of annoyance and
anger.

Striking a balance to keep White conscious yet in pain, Miya controlled
the intensity of her attacks, repeatedly causing explosions at White’s
abdomen.

“How dare you, my hair…!”

“Ah, ahh…”

Though there was no visible change to Miya’s hair, the fact that a few
strands were cut by such a person incited unquenchable rage within her.

White seemed unable to even scream, only managing to emit a pitiful wail
mixed with sobs.

Yet, she did not give up. Her will, fueled by anger, pride, and a desire
to win, kept her from backing down.

Thus, Miya continued to inflict pain, exploiting White’s emotions.

The referee sweated coldly, unable to intervene in the fight, as White
still refused to give up.

All he could do was hope that White would surrender soon.

“For the sake of the Empire, you tried to do this and that to me, didn’t
you?”

“Grr…!”

*Boom─!*

“After all, you can’t do anything.”

“Ahh…”

*Boom─!*

“Being so weak, why are you so arrogant? Snow White?”

“Aaah, ahh…”

*Boom─!*

In the dueling grounds, only the sound of Miya’s explosive fire magic
echoed.

Miya’s voice did not reach the audience, but the students murmured among
themselves with shocked expressions.

“Even for a duel, isn’t this too much…?”

“That’s just… torture, not a duel.”

“No, we should still see it through to the end.”

“Idiot, what else would you call this? Her Highness the princess is
barely hanging on, trying not to faint.”

“Ew…”

The duel should have been considered over already.

Even at the risk of being accused of abusing authority, the referee
contemplated stopping the duel for the student’s safety.

White’s bloodshot eyes began to roll back. Her body seemed to scream for
release from the pain.

But White could not give up.

*Thud.*

White’s fist weakly rose and touched Miya’s cheek.

In that moment, a hush fell.

“Oh…”

The veins on Miya’s forehead bulged more fiercely.

She removed her hand from White’s tattered abdomen, grabbed her throat,
and stood up.

“Gag…!”

White couldn’t breathe. It was agonizing.

Fire mana swirled on Miya’s hand.

Even though just uttering the word “surrender” would have sufficed,
White could not bring herself to say it.

Her anger was unbearable, and the frustration of being powerless against
Miya drove her nearly mad.

“Let’s end it here.”

Miya’s voice was sarcastic.

This was dangerous. Even if healing magic could be applied after the
duel, excessively severe injuries could still threaten a student’s life.

“That’s enough, Miya…!”

Just as the referee was about to urgently shout, “Stop the match”,

A male student appeared suddenly right beside White and Miya.

He lightly touched Miya’s arm, which was choking White.

Miya glared at the male student who dared to lay a hand on her,
frowning.

***“Just try and do something.”***

His voice was cold.

Silver-blue hair. A school uniform tie with a blue brooch, symbolizing a
second-year student.

It was Isaac, a second-year senior.

Expressionless. His eyes were shadowed by his bangs. His crimson pupils
emitted a cold glow.

The sudden intrusion heavily charged the atmosphere in the arena.

“Hello, Senior? Why the hell are you messing with our duel?”

Miya asked with a sweet smile and a gentle tone.

Instead of answering, Isaac gestured towards White. Miya turned her head
to look at her.

White’s eyes were rolled back, her body limp. She had lost
consciousness, unable to even close her eyes.

She had finally reached her limit amidst the terrible pain.

“Ah, she fainted.”

Miya chuckled and then released White’s throat.

With a thud, White’s body collapsed powerlessly onto the cold hard
floor.

Isaac looked down at White, who was now completely battered.

For a brief moment, a myriad of emotions crossed his heart.

Beyond his silver-blue hair, his crimson eyes were as frigid as the
coldest winter. Anger, deep as an abyss, enveloped his entire being.

His emotions leaked throughout the arena, enveloping it in his chill.

In the deep silence, the students were overwhelmed by Isaac’s murderous
aura, swallowing dryly.

***“Miya…”***

Isaac’s eyes turned towards Miya.

His voice, both calm and cold, settled in the arena.

***“…Duel me, right now.”***

Chapter 168: Fury (3)
=====================

**༺ Fury (3) ༻**

“Do you know why I challenged that insect to a duel?”

One day in the past. Morning.

The top-ranked dorm, Charles Hall.

Miya, the Priestess in her uniform, sipped her tea while looking out the
window.

Since there was still plenty of time before classes began, Miya had tea
time at her leisure.

\[It seems you’re finally going to tell me.\]

From Miya’s index fingernail, a small flame in the shape of a
nine-tailed fox leapt out.

\[Go ahead.\]

“I want Senior Luce. But, she likes that Insect senior too much.”

Miya said this while thinking of Isaac, her silver-blue-haired senior.

“He doesn’t seem to have anything good going for him other than his
face. He’s not even the most handsome man in the academy. What’s so
great about him that Senior Luce makes such a fuss over?”

\[Hmm.\]

“Anyway, he’s important to Senior Luce. So, I decided to do a test.”

Miya smiled slyly.

“I will gradually cripple that insect. Play with him, make him mute,
deaf, slowly, one by one, taking away everything that he has. Until one
day Senior Luce begs me to stop. We have the power to do so.”

There was a story from when she was 13.

There was a man she wanted to make her subordinate.

The man had a family and therefore refused Priestess Miya’s proposal.

Miya took out the eyes of the man’s family members and then ordered him
to become her subordinate before she did something worse.

The man had to follow her in silent tears.

If someone cherished something, to Miya, it was nothing more than prey
to be hunted. It would always be a weakness to exploit.

***Luce is no exception.***

“To torment that insect while following the academy rules, a duel is the
optimal method.”

Miya was willing to do anything to get what she desired.

No matter what happened to others, everything had to be sacrificed for
her own sake.

She wanted Luce Eltania. Therefore, she decided to trample on Isaac’s
life, whom Luce cherished. That was Miya’s ultimate decision.

***Then, what is the reason for wanting to make a genius like Luce
Eltania hers?***

“One day, we have to devour the Zelver Empire.”

It was about strengthening the power of Horan, Land of the Fire
Blossoms.

“If Horan reaches the top of the world, I will be its ruler. For that,
monsters like Senior Luce need to be on my side. If even my prince
becomes my husband, it would be perfect. Hehe, my mighty prince… I want
to see him again…”

She planned to challenge the Zelver Empire, wage war, and trample on the
lives of many to reign at the top of the world.

The reason she wanted to make talented individuals like Luce Eltania or
Dorothy Heartnova her own was to achieve such a goal.

Here, the reason for Miya’s enrollment in Märchen Academy became clear.

Firstly, pursuing a love called ‘The Nameless Hero’. That was the main
reason.

Secondly, recruiting talent, and creating subordinates. That was the
second reason.

One day, Miya wanted to rule the world. If she could conquer the Zelver
Empire, world domination would swiftly follow.

Coincidentally, Princess Snow White enrolled as her fellow student. This
was a stroke of luck.

Being a representative of the Eastern nation, she could deepen the rift
with the Zelver Empire.

It would have taken years of groundwork to make both countries resent
each other.

Eventually, when the citizens clamored for war…

Miya, having laid the groundwork, would use Horan to devour the Zelver
Empire.

In short,

Bringing talents like Luce Eltania to her side was part of her plan to
realize this grand scheme.

“I’m excited.”

Miya grinned with flushed cheeks.

“Things got way more interesting.”

Present. Magic Department Duel Grounds.

The Clover Paladin, a male student with a benign appearance, sat in the
audience and watched the arena with a smile.

Meanwhile, Ciel Carnedas intently focused on Isaac’s intrusion, having
never seen the archwizard so enraged.

“Duel over! Class A Miya wins! Medical team, transport student Snow
White! Quickly!!”

The referee urgently declared the winner and called the medical team
first.

The healers, carrying a stretcher, went up to the arena and carefully
moved Princess Snow White onto it.

Her body was covered in gruesome burns, especially the abdomen, which
was in an almost unseeable state.

The healers quickly covered White’s body with a white cloth, and several
of them immediately began emergency treatment with healing magic as they
moved toward the grounds’ corridor.

Isaac, wanting to watch over White until the end, walked briskly
alongside them.

“Senior… I… saac…”

White weakly moved her cracked lips.

It seemed she regained consciousness thanks to the healing magic.

“White!”

Isaac shouted.

Tears flowed from White’s eyes.

“Why am I… so pathetic…? Why am I… so pathetic…”

Overwhelmed by her emotions, White couldn’t hold back her tears.

Her sobbing voice seemed to constrict Isaac’s heart.

Isaac shook his head and offered consolation in an urgent voice.

“No, you did well. Really well…! Truly, the grit you showed to never
give up was a showing worthy of being my mentee. You did well, White.”

“Why, why am I like this…”

Isaac’s voice did not seem to reach White.

She just sobbed, covering her eyes with her burned hands.

The medical team then took White away through the corridor.

Isaac stood still in front of the corridor, quietly watching White leave
for a while.

“…”

Isaac steadied his breathing.

He took off his round glasses and raised his head, staring into space.

What the Miya had done was not a duel…

***…It was nothing but cruel torment.***

Thus, within Isaac, who cherished White, the cold of the bitterest of
ice ages raged.

“Student Isaac.”

The referee approached Isaac from behind and spoke.

“The order of the duels is predetermined. First, you need the agreement
of your opponent, and you must also arrange with the next in line,
students Mateo Jordana and Jack Schneider, to change the order-“

“Mateo!!”

Isaac shouted in the middle of the referee’s explanation.

Mateo Jordana, a second-year male student with short brown hair sitting
in the audience, flinched at the sound.

The shout of the Nameless Hero, an archwizard with the power to destroy
the world at any moment, caused him to grow tense.

His eyes, usually kind, now bore a cold and murderous look as they fixed
on Mateo.

“Change the order.”

That one command was enough.

Mateo responded in a frightened voice, “Y-yes!”

Jack Schneider, who had been miserably defeated by Isaac last year,
nervously nodded along with Mateo.

For Jack, it was the first time seeing Isaac, who usually had a gentle
demeanor, with such a murderous intent.

“Well then… Now we only need student Miya’s agreement. Student Miya, is
it okay to proceed with the duel without a break?”

“Absolutely.”

Miya smiled like a fox, as if pleased. After all, the duel with Snow
White, the first-year bottom ranker and a weakling, hadn’t drained much
of her mana. There were no problems.

Isaac climbed back up to the arena, facing Miya with a distance between
them.

The referee returned to his position.

The judges and the students all looked at the arena with tense faces.

\[Miya.\]

The voice of the familiar, Mae, lingering on Miya’s index fingernail,
echoed in her mind.

\[If needed, I’ll intervene.\]

‘Don’t intervene under any circumstances. Shut up and stay still. This
is an order. There’s no need for you to get involved against this
insect.’

Miya scolded the Nine-tailed fox through her mind.

She had no intention whatsoever of summoning her familiar against Isaac.

Already considering herself stronger, her pride wouldn’t have allowed
her to resort to using her familiar.

“Seems like you’re really angry, huh? You must have developed plenty of
affection while mentoring Snow White?”

Miya asked in a taunting tone.

However, Isaac, with his eyes downcast, gave no response. His
silver-blue bangs covered his eyes.

It seemed as if he was concentrating on something.

“This damn insect. Daring to ignore me…”

Miya frowned and grumbled in a low voice.

“Well then, The means are unlimited. No surrender for the first minute.
If one side faints or becomes unable to fight, the duel immediately
ends! Approach the duel with respect for each other!”

After the referee finished the formal explanation,

“Ready, duel start!”

He announced the start of the duel by raising his arm.

The referee stepped back, leaving only Isaac and Miya in the vast arena.

Isaac loosened the brooch on his tie and took off his school jacket,
clutching it in his left hand.

With Zhonya’s staff in his right hand, he fiercely struck the ground and
glared at Miya, unleashing a ferocious blast of ice mana.

A light blue magic circle instantly unfolded behind him.

<span id="0167_169_Fury_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 169: Fury (4)
=====================

**༺ Fury (4) ༻**

“Ho-ho…”

Miya admired.

Until just a moment ago, Isaac had been processing a 6-star magic circle
in his head that he was still not familiar with. Observing the form of
the light blue magic circle that was deployed behind him, Miya realized
it was the 6-star ice spell \[Frost Wave\].

Soon, the magic circle casted by Isaac emitted an intense light.

*Chararararak──!!!*

Starting from Isaac, an icy chill violently spread out in all
directions.

Miya leisurely deployed a fire magic circle, spreading flames around her
to counteract Isaac’s chill.

The battle between fire magic and ice magic was determined by their
temperature and momentum. Would it be overwhelmingly hot, or
overwhelmingly cold?

Generally, fire had the upper hand, but if the skill gap wasn’t too
large, the result that appears would be…

*Chshhhh──*

*Boom──!!*

A steam explosion.

The spreading steam. On the dueling grounds, now turned into a sheet of
ice, visibility was blocked for both sides.

Miya sensed Isaac’s mana, tracked it, and was ready to cast a spell,
but…

“…!”

As soon as she finished her thought, Isaac had already penetrated the
steam and reached right in front of Miya’s nose.

For Miya, who was experiencing Isaac’s combat style for the first time,
it was inevitably baffling. It was an unbelievable physical ability.

In other words, Isaac’s choice of tactic was because Miya was his
opponent.

If the opponent had been someone like Tristan, who knew Isaac’s combat
style well, they wouldn’t have been easily flustered like Miya.

A moment of carelessness pushed Miya into a corner.

*Bash──!*

“Gah!”

Suddenly, Isaac’s fist, covered in \[Rock Armor\], drilled into Miya’s
face.

There was a crack, the sound of something breaking was heard. Isaac’s
rock fist boasted the power to even break through Miya’s \[Basic
Protection Magic\].

Miya’s body flew backward like a ball. Blood gushed from her mouth and
nose like an open faucet.

But she disregarded the pain, and quickly spread flames explosively
below her, lifting her body up and regaining her posture.

“You filthy insect!!!”

Furious, Miya instantly deployed three magic circles.

As she was about to engulf Isaac in flames, suddenly, his school uniform
jacket flew and entered Miya’s field of vision.

Using something like that to block her vision and launch an attack? It
was such a shallow tactic that a sneer involuntarily burst out.

Merely a second. No, less than a second. Miya’s vision was briefly
obstructed.

Beyond that, Miya waved her fan and launched a 3-star magic
\[Fireball\].

Despite being cast in an instant, it was very large in size and high in
mana density.

*Boom!*

The \[Fireball\] mistakenly exploded in the wrong place.

Before she knew it, Isaac had already moved out of Miya’s line of sight.

“Where did he…?!”

At that moment.

Isaac’s falling school uniform jacket emitted a faint blue light.

Something hidden inside it had been activated.

A strange pressure. Miya realized that something with a unique mana
structure was hidden inside Isaac’s school uniform jacket.

Miya’s eyes widened.

It was the moment she realized that Isaac had thrown his school uniform
jacket to make use of something hidden inside.

─The stored ice mana exploded.

*Kraaaaaaaaa──────!!!*

5-star ice spell, \[Frost Explosion\].

The Sheath of Disaster, hidden in the pocket of the school uniform
jacket, unleashed a powerful \[Frost Explosion\].

“Guaah!!”

Miya’s insides were mutilated from the explosion of ice mana, and the
rushing ice bore into her body.

Even as she vomited blood, Miya hastily swung her fire magic, burning
away every ounce of frost in her wake. Her sincere fire magic was on a
different level in both temperature and power from what she first used.

She couldn’t understand the situation. What was inside that school
uniform jacket?

Before she could deduce the truth, an unbearable irritation surged. Miya
felt a twisting anger inside her.

The density and amount of mana, the power of the magic. All should have
been superior to that of her silver-haired senior, who seemed like an
insect.

‘Why am I… losing…?’

***…It’s obvious.***

The difference in combat experience was stark.

Isaac, who brutally trained, sparred, and even engaged in
life-threatening battles every day, inevitably had an upper hand in
combat experience over Miya.

Furthermore, with superior physical abilities, it was natural that Miya
couldn’t fully react to Isaac’s unconventional combat style.

It was only then that Miya realized her grave misconception that Isaac
would fight like a usual wizard.

“Ma-!!”

Miya tried to call the name of the nine-tailed fox, intending to use its
power.

She wanted to throw away her pride and everything else, just to burn
Isaac first.

If she could use the power of the nine-tailed fox, Isaac, who engaged in
such despicable combat, wouldn’t be able to do anything further.

As such, while Miya was calculating the summoning spell to use the power
of the Nine-tailed fox.

*Whoosh─!*

Isaac instantly entered Miya’s line of sight. He had already stepped
beside her.

Miya’s body was still before touching the ground. In other words, he had
caught up to her with a terrifying speed.

Miya’s eyes widened in shock. How on earth could someone move at such a
speed?

Miya quickly deployed a 4-star defense spell, \[Flame Wall\], wrapping
her body in flames composed of dense mana for protection.

At the same time, she attempted to pour flames toward Isaac.

By then, Isaac was already pulling up an ice wall infused with rock
mana, \[Fossilized Ice\], right in front of her.

“…!!”

Judging by the timing, Isaac didn’t use \[Fossilized Ice\] in response
to Miya’s attack. It was clear he had been approaching while using
\[Fossilized Ice\] from the start.

Miya’s flames couldn’t melt Isaac’s \[Fossilized Ice\] instantly.

Only then did Miya notice the magic circle deployed above her. Below it
was a spherical mass of mana, emitting a light blue glow.

In this duel,

Isaac was using every fleeting moment advantageously.

Miya felt a revolting sensation as if she had been dancing on Isaac’s
palm from the very start.

It was as if her actions were being manipulated.

With her current defense, she wouldn’t be able to block that ice spell.

The light blue sphere instantly unleashed a burst of ice and mana.

「Frost Glitter (Ice Element, ★6)」

*Whooooosh─────────!!*

The 6-star spell, \[Frost Glitter\], was a spell that sent out a sphere
tightly packed with a massive amount of ice mana and then exploded it.

A blinding flash was unleashed.

Reflexively, she shut her eyes tightly.

Numerous ice spikes, with high mana density, penetrated through Miya’s
flames and pierced her body.

Various parts of her body rapidly froze.

“Kaaah!!”

Miya screamed at the top of her lungs and fell to the ground with a
thud.

Isaac quickly grabbed her black hair.

Miya’s body was tattered.

Isaac’s other hand was directed towards Miya’s abdomen.

“Like this, wasn’t it?”

*Kraaaa───!!*

“Kahaak!!”

Towards Miya’s already shattered abdomen, Isaac continuously unleashed
\[Frost Explosion\] of moderate power.

*Kraaa!*

“Don’t you know?”

“Kuhuk!”

*Kraaa!*

“White wanted to be friends with you.”

“Stop, stop…!”

*Kwaaa!*

“I don’t know what conversation you two had, but…”

“Uh, ha…”

*Kwaaa!*

“What kind of treatment is this to someone… who just wanted to be
friends with you?”

“Aaah…”

In the dense fog that had now filled the dueling grounds, only the sound
of Miya’s abdomen bursting and freezing echoed.

Terrible pain wildly churned in Miya’s mind.

The constant interruption of her thoughts made it impossible for her to
properly calculate the deployment of her fire magic circle or the
summoning of her familiar.

Because Isaac had grabbed her hair, her body kept bouncing like a
pendulum each time a \[Frost Explosion\] was cast.

The icy chill and tearing pain ravaged Miya’s entire body. Yet, even
amidst that immense pain, she wanted to torment Isaac somehow.

As if she were out of her mind, she chuckled and laughed. Isaac stopped
the \[Frost Explosion\] and glared at her.

“You, filthy, insect…! To do this to me…! My nation, Horan… will not…
let you… get away with this…!”

*Kraaa─!!*

“Kehuk!!”

As another \[Frost Explosion\] was unleashed, Miya’s eyes rolled back.
Her eyes were bloodshot with tears of blood streaming down. A body
stained with blood. It was as if he was seeing White from the previous
duel.

But Isaac was as bitter as the cold he had used.

Miya just violated the unwritten rule that what happened in the academy
must end in the academy. Isaac clicked his tongue in disdain at her vile
behavior.

Miya was on the verge of fainting. Isaac grabbed her head and smashed it
into the ground.

*Boom!*

“Horan or whatever, come and see.”

Then Isaac activated a 6-star ice spell, \[Frost Wave\].

*Charararararack───!!!*

The intense cold spread rapidly, driving away the dense fog.

The Priestess, battered with frostbite, frostnip, and penetrating
wounds, was completely frozen.

It was a shocking sight.

Everyone in the arena was stunned.

Most people, despite feeling sorry for White, had expected Miya to win.

The outcome before their eyes far exceeded their expectations.

The Clover Paladin grinned excitedly as if amused.

Ciel, Mateo, and Jack were speechless.

The arena was engulfed in silence.

Isaac coldly looked down at Miya lying beneath him, his crimson eyes
filled with scorn.

“Haa.”

His breath turned into a white frost, scattering in the cold wind.

<span id="0168_170_Fury__Interlude_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 170: Fury — Interlude (1)
=================================

**༺ Fury – Interlude (1) ༻**

Undoubtedly, Priestess Miya was stronger than Isaac.

The difference in mana, the difference in mana mastery, to the status of
their familiars. It was clear that Miya had the upper hand in
everything.

Unless one’s mana perception was utterly atrocious, everyone would have
felt the same way.

However, the duel defied many people’s expectations and showed a
completely different outcome.

“Amazing…”

The Clover Paladin was in awe.

When the duel began, Isaac’s mana density suddenly intensified.

It must surely be due to that magic weapon, the staff. It seemed to be
at least Tier 2. Wielding such a staff served as proof of Isaac’s
considerable skill.

Of course, there was also the possibility that he was an archwizard or
the Black Monster who knew how to manipulate its mana quantity, however…

Even though he was clearly angry, he only showed a level of power
enhancement that could be explained by the magic weapon he was using.

And yet, he didn’t match Miya’s power.

He simply overwhelmed Miya with technique. Therefore, the possibility of
him being the Black Monster was put aside.

For now, it was just his battle sense that was astonishing.

The Clover Paladin noticed it. Isaac was toying with Miya, a strong
opponent, in the palm of his hands. Even though he felt enraged, he
calmly observed the situation and devised tactics.

Of course, Miya still had her powers hidden.

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae. If she had used the power of that familiar,
Isaac’s technique would have been meaningless.

He would have been defeated due to the overwhelming difference in power.

However, astonishingly, the Clover Paladin realized that Isaac had even
read that.

Isaac must have thought that it would be over the moment Miya brought
out Mae, and he exploited her arrogance. He baited her actions as he
intended and dealt with them excellently.

Thus, Miya lost without even being able to use Mae’s power.

After all, whatever power one might have, it was useless if it couldn’t
be used.

The duel was to show combat ability. A person who could gauge the
opponent’s power and effectively exert their own abilities to win was
bound to score well.

In that sense, this duel could be considered a decisive victory for
Isaac.

“T-the duel is over…! Class B Isaac wins!”

When the referee raised an arm and declared loudly, Isaac removed his
hand from Miya and stood up from his position.

The students watching the dueling ground sent cheers with surprised
faces. Many students murmured in admiration, “Isaac actually won…”

The owner of a nation-destroying familiar and a true genius. The
Priestess from the Eastern Nation. She had been defeated by a man who
was once considered the weakest Grade E mana.

Even though he was now at the top of B class as a second year, the
difference in power must have been significant.

For the students, it was a scene that left them in utter astonishment.

The medical team rushed in. They carried Priestess Miya away on a
stretcher.

Isaac, after seeking understanding from the judges, ran straight through
the corridor of the dueling grounds without even listening to their
feedback

It was understandable, as Snow White’s mentor, he must have left in a
hurry out of concern for her.

“…”

Mateo Jordana and Ciel Carnedas, who knew that Isaac was the Nameless
Hero, were quietly lost in thought.

“It seemed like he was definitely angry…”

Ciel, with a lightly clenched fist against her lips, murmured with her
head bowed.

Isaac was definitely angry at Miya.

It seemed like he had unleashed part of his power because of it, but it
was still insufficient against Miya. Was it to pretend that he enhanced
his power due to the effect of the magic weapon?

Naturally, the better one handled a high-tier magic weapon, the greater
the density of mana.

This was also why Isaac could deceive others about the maximum change in
his mana with the magic weapon during the joint practical evaluation.

However, having seen Isaac’s duel, Ciel felt even stronger doubts.

Even though he was angry, and no one in this academy would be his match…

Isaac had not fully unleashed his power.

‘As if he must not get caught in something…’

Perhaps Isaac’s pretense of growing rapidly was because remaining weak
would restrict his actions.

Such behavior could only be explained as ‘deceiving something.’

But still…

Even if a dear person suffered a terrible fate, even if he was angry,
what could be the reason that such an overwhelming powerhouse mustn’t
reveal his strength?

***Can there even be such a reason?***

“…”

Ciel’s doubts only deepened.

\* \* \*

\[ Status \]

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac

**Lv:** 116

**Gender:** Male

**Year:** 2nd

**Title:** Skilled Second Year

**Mana:** 27550/37700

– Mana Recovery Speed (A)

Reading Miya’s behavior patterns was a simple task for a veteran of
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

He tailored his tactics accordingly, and fortunately, the outcome was
successful.

If I had made even a slight mistake or if my attack had been blocked
even for a moment…

‘I would have definitely lost.’

I was reminded of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ Act 8, Priestess of the Red
Lotus.

Against Miya, who used the power of the Nine-tailed Fox, a meager tactic
like the one used in this duel wouldn’t have worked.

Fortunately, Miya underestimated me, let her guard down, and ultimately
lost the duel, just like in the sub-event 「Burning Petals」.

‘My level has now risen to 116.’

It wasn’t long since I reached level 115, but I had gained another level
already. The EXP was substantial.

I also unlocked the achievement \[Defeating the Priestess\], gaining 10
points of\[Fire Resistance\] as a reward.

I invested every stat point I had earned from leveling up into \[vs.
Human Combat Power\], considering I would have to face Alice and the
Paladins in the near future.

◈ Elemental Resistance – Fire Resistance (D+): 20/100 \[UP\] ◈ vs. Race
Combat Power – vs. Human Combat Power (B): 44/100 \[UP\]

I should start investing in \[vs. Heavenly Beings Combat Power\] and
\[vs. Other Races Combat Power\] soon, especially in preparation for 「
Descent of Heaven」 and the 「 Fairy War」.

Especially with Heavenly Beings, who have very high elemental magic
resistance. A strong physique was absolutely essential.

In other words, if things had gone according to my original plan, with
Dorothy around, I wouldn’t have focused solely on \[vs. Human Combat
power\].

However, the immediate threat, the Paladins, caused a change in plans.

Once I reached a level where I could defeat all of them with effort to
spare, I needed to restrain myself from further investing in \[vs. Human
Combat power\].

‘But before that…’

I hurriedly ran towards the academy hospital.

Because I was worried about White.

\* \* \*

In the dream, a temptingly ripe, bright red apple flickered before
White’s eyes.

As she reached for it, attracted by its delicious appearance, suddenly,
she saw her mother dressed in a luxurious gown.

Her mother, famed to be the most beautiful in the world, was said to
have won the favor of Emperor Carlos solely through her unequivocal
beauty.

She always wore dresses that covered her up to her neck, even here in
this dream.

Her mother, with a mouth ripped to her ears and a bizarre smile urged
her in a gentle voice to eat the apple.

White stared intently at this figure.

She wanted to ask her mother how she knew about this apple.

But as the thought of something too terrible to imagine began to
surface, fear started to consume White.

She couldn’t open her mouth.

“Why aren’t you eating it?”

Her mother prodded with her large mouth, insisting she eat it
immediately.

White was terrified. Only then did she realize that she had eaten this
apple before.

This apple led to death, a poisoned apple.

Inside the torn mouth of her mother, urging her to eat it, something
evil smiled broadly at White.

\*\*\*

“…!”

Snow White suddenly opened her eyes.

Before she could even feel the softness behind her head, the faces of
two people appeared in her field of vision.

The escort knight with a dark green ponytail, Merlin Astrea.

Her senior with wavy silver-blue hair, Isaac.

Everyone was surprised as White opened her eyes.

“White! Are you okay?”

“Princess!”

“Senior Isaac, Merlin…?”

White sat up, looking around her.

She appeared to be in a private room in the academy’s infirmary.

Even though the academy tried to treat all students equally regardless
of status, in reality, there was an inevitable disparity.

Immediately, she realized that being the princess of this nation had led
her to a fine private room.

The pain in her body had significantly subsided compared to before.

“…It doesn’t hurt much.”

“You received healing magic as soon as you were injured. The burns have
healed for now. You just need to rest for a few days.”

White looked at Isaac, who was explaining all this from the guardian’s
seat next to her. For some reason, he was without his glasses, unlike
usual.

“Do you want some?”

Isaac, with a tense expression, took out a mana pudding bar and offered
it to White.

Merlin, too, with a nervous face, reassured White, “I’ll only eat a
little this time.”

Earlier, in the duel, White had lost to Miya. This was a major blow to
White’s already fragile ego. Hence, there was a need to treat White with
great care.

“…Ehehe.”

Realizing their consideration immediately, White let out a shy laugh.

“Thank you, Senior Isaac.”

Isaac and Merlin relaxed as White smiled and took the mana pudding bar.

As soon as she tore open the wrapper, Merlin said, “Please wait a
moment, Princess,” and bit into the mana pudding bar with an ‘Om’.

When about a third of the mana pudding bar disappeared, tears welled up
in White’s eyes again.

“You said you’d only eat a little…”

“…Yes?”

White’s hands trembled. Hearing her complaint filled with sobs, Merlin
was flustered.

“Wasn’t this ‘a little’?” Merlin seemed to ask with a hesitant
expression.

It couldn’t be helped. What was lost was lost. White reluctantly bit
into the remaining mana pudding bar.

Whether tears of joy or sorrow, White shed small, grain-like tears.

“It’s delicious…”

“Is it that delicious…? I’m, I’m sorry! I should have had a bit less…”

Merlin apologized, bowing her head. White, with tears in her eyes, shook
her head, saying “It’s okay…” She felt resigned.

Then, White looked down.

Her resentment had not subsided. Her tears flowed, recalling how Miya
had insulted her.

The gap in strength was extreme. White, who couldn’t even imagine
tormenting others, could only resent Miya.

Just one hit. If she had managed to land even a single proper hit… she
wouldn’t have felt so miserable.

“Senior Isaac…”

“Yes.”

“I was really angry at Ms. Miya… She said really… harsh things to me.
But, I couldn’t do anything…”

White bowed her head and expressed her honest feelings.

With her hands tightly clenched into the blanket, her shoulders
trembling.

“If I could have just landed a single hit on Ms. Miya, it would have
been good… I’m so frustrated that I couldn’t. But she’s strong, isn’t
she? She wouldn’t easily lose to just anyone… I’m so angry, and the fact
that I can’t do anything about it… it’s just so… depressing…”

“Ah, if you’re talking about the Priestess, Sir Isaac has already dealt
with her.”

“…?”

When Merlin bluntly responded, White’s head jerked up in surprise.

White looked at Merlin with an expression of disbelief.

“What did you just say…?”

“As soon as Princess White’s duel ended, Sir Isaac immediately
challenged the Priestess and won. The Priestess was left in a terrible
state and is currently being treated.”

“…???”

White’s expression became perplexed, like someone trying to solve a
riddle.

Even after listening again, she couldn’t fully comprehend Merlin’s
words.

***So, Isaac, her senior, had… devastatingly defeated the strong
Miya?***

White turned her head creakily towards Isaac. He smiled awkwardly, with
his usual kind expression.

“That just happened to be the case…”

“…”

For a while, White remained speechless.

Chapter 171: Fury — Interlude (2)
=================================

**༺ Fury – Interlude (2) ༻**

“Argh!! Bring that bastard here now!! That insolent insect!! Argh!!”

“Calm down! Student Miya!!”

Academy Hospital. Treatment Room.

Covered in blood, Miya screamed and caused a disturbance. She had
received healing magic, but her wounds hadn’t fully healed yet.

The floor was strewn with all kinds of broken items, shattered due to
her forcefully pushing everything off the shelves with her arm.

Though it was better than it was at first, Miya still felt the pain of
her insides twisting.

That pain continuously fueled the fire of her ceaseless rage.

The healers tried to calm her with their arms extended. They felt a
trembling tension in the presence of her formidable mana that made every
hair on their body stand on end.

“Y-you need to heal first…!”

“Student Miya, calm down! Your wounds will open!!”

Miya, who regarded the healers as nothing more than insects, glared at
them with her eyes that had turned bright red and bloodshot.

Her forehead was flushed red with veins bulging as if they would burst,
baring her teeth and threatening like a beast.

“Bug bastard. I told you to bring him, and you keep ordering someone
else…!”

Just then.

The door creaked open.

Everyone’s gaze turned towards the entrance.

As a beautiful third-year female student with light-gold hair entered,
Miya’s eyes widened in surprise.

The girl, smiling gently, was someone Miya hadn’t even imagined would
appear here.

It was the Student Council President, Alice Carroll.

“Student Council President? Why are you here…?”

“I stopped by because it was noisy on my way.”

Alice Carroll was also one of the targets Miya had intended to win over.
Even amidst twitching pain, Miya’s voice naturally calmed down.

A powerhouse second only to Dorothy. A true force to be reckoned with,
commanding the Phantom Cat Cheshire as her familiar.

Her face was adorned with a relaxed smile.

Alice walked steadily and stopped in front of Miya, who wanted to make
her a subordinate someday,

Their gazes silently intertwined.

“Hey.”

A kind voice.

Alice leaned forward slightly and brought her head close to Miya’s ear.

As Alice’s warm breath caressed her nape, Miya’s ears reflexively turned
red.

Without realizing it, Miya swallowed and tensed up. Alice exuded an
enchanting charm simply by existing.

The healers watched them in silence. The Student Council, which also
took on the role of handling incidents and accidents, decided to leave
the situation for Alice to handle.

Alice’s enchanting voice whispered softly.

“I heard you were hurt by Isaac. It must be… very upsetting, right?”

Her voice had a magical charm that could captivate one’s heart.

Without realizing it, Miya gently nodded her head.

Was it an intention to soothe and comfort her anger?

With that thought, Miya swallowed dryly.

Alice continued to speak, still with a kind smile on her face.

The words that followed completely overturned Miya’s expectations.

“Stop bitching and stay mad, you brat.”

“…What?”

***Could she have heard wrong?***

Miya felt puzzled.

A look of dismay spread across her face.

No matter how much she thought about it, it was clear. Alice’s lips had
uttered aggressive words that did not match her gentle voice.

The healers did not hear Alice’s whisper, so they just stood still, on
guard.

Miya looked at Alice with a surprised face. Their eyes met.

Alice’s smile, her cherry blossom eyes. All of it suddenly began to
provoke Miya’s anger.

Miya’s expression became fiercely distorted.

A heavy force of mana weighed heavily on the air, and flames of mana
began to smolderingly rise from Miya’s body.

Miya glared at Alice as if she wanted to kill her.

“You, what did you just say…?”

*Boom!*

A mysterious force exploded in Miya’s limbs.

Miya experienced such a sensation for a moment.

“Huh?!”

Miya quickly extinguished the fire mana and examined her limbs in a
panic. They were all intact.

Cold sweat poured down like rain. Her pupils shook violently. What had
just happened to her?

*Groooooo──.*

“…!”

Miya felt it. Alice’s mana had filled the treatment room, swallowing up
her own.

Mana so dense and far superior to her own. Any rational human would not
be able to maintain their composure in the face of such terrifying
power.

Fear was an emotion created for survival. A bodily warning to choose
flight over fight. That was the instinctive feeling Miya had felt at
that moment.

Miya turned her gaze towards Alice, her head shaking uncontrollably.

Miya, who possessed considerable mana in her own right, could distinctly
recognize the threat directed towards her because of it.

Behind Alice, a massive and bizarre purple monster, formed from mana,
seemed to roar. It was the power of the Phantom Cat Cheshire.

Buried among the Nameless Hero, there were still monsters in this
academy.

And now, Miya deeply realized that Alice was one of those monsters.

“Ah…”

And then, Miya realized.

If she had lashed out with flames at Alice here, she would have faced a
devastating outcome incomparable to what had happened with Isaac.

Alice, displaying her noble dignity, distanced herself from Miya.

“It’s not that I don’t understand you, but I’m saying this for your own
good, so remember. ‘Revenge is to be taken within the boundaries of the
academy’. For now, I want you to let go of that anger and focus on your
recovery.”

Alice smiled sweetly, spread her index finger, and admonished with ease.
Her gentle demeanor made it feel as if her earlier swearing had been a
lie.

“You’ll do that, right?”

“…”

Miya nodded with difficulty when Alice kindly asked, almost as if she
was being coerced.

“Good.”

Alice nodded in satisfaction, then waved her hand gently to the healers,
saying, “I’ll be off then. Everyone, take care\~,” and left the
treatment room.

A heavy atmosphere lingered throughout.

Soon after, Miya’s legs gave way, and she flopped down on the bed.

Her expression was one of utter despair.

Meanwhile, in the academy hospital corridor.

Alice hurried along, greeting the passing healers with a smile.

\[Meow. Alice, that was fun.\]

Suddenly, the voice of the Phantom Cat Cheshire rang in Alice’s head.

Since the Phantom Cat Cheshire was nearby, a conversation between master
and familiar that no one else could hear was possible.

\[Does the Priestess seem useful?\]

‘Yes.’

Alice wanted to make use of Miya.

She was arrogant and foolish, yet the master of a powerful magic beast,
the Nine-tailed Fox, and possessed quite decent skills.

Moreover.

‘And there’s a demon hiding in her shadows.’

In Miya’s shadow,

A demon was hiding, biding its time in silence.

In the labyrinth where she could summon the minds of her subordinates,
Alice received interesting information from Clover Paladin.

It was information that Isaac had defeated Priestess Miya in a duel.

Not just a simple duel, but one filled with emotion. This was a
satisfying situation for Alice.

A Priestess with a demon attached to her, and one who was always ready
to cross any line.

She resented Isaac, who might be the Black Monster.

***How could someone be so useful?***

‘She’s too valuable to waste.’

To put it metaphorically…

In the chess game against the Black Monster, with Märchen Academy as the
chessboard, Miya was a pawn on the cusp of promotion.

Alice did not want such a valuable piece to cause trouble and receive
severe punishment because it could not control its emotions.

So, Alice had restrained Miya threateningly, as one would restrain a
rampaging dog.

Due to the damned Leafa the Illusive, the academy was rife with rumors
of an informant.

If it were discovered that she was the informant, not only would she be
expelled, but the academy and the Empire would turn against her.

Thus, in a position where she could not act rashly, a being as useful as
Miya was invaluable to Alice.

‘She is not fully ripe yet. If she continues to harbor anger and finally
becomes ripe…’

Alice wanted Miya to gradually develop resentment towards Isaac.

As time passed…

‘When the perfect opportunity comes, I should make her explode.’

It would be beneficial to sacrifice Miya to find out whether Isaac truly
was the Black Monster or not.

Alice walked out calmly.

Her destination was White’s private hospital room.

\* \* \*

Right before my eyes, a scene unfolded that was beyond my wildest
imagination.

In White’s private hospital room. While training with mana and taking
care of White alongside Merlin.

*Knock, knock*.

A sound came from the door, and Merlin opened it, allowing a beautiful
female student to enter.

White looked at the beautiful senior with disbelief, admiration pouring
from her eyes.

‘What’s this?’

It was bewildering. Why had she come here?

She walked towards White and me, her light-gold hair swaying.

She smiled at me before greeting White politely.

She seemed to be pretending not to know me openly in front of the
princess. The atmosphere suggested a casual passing off as White’s
mentor.

That was a relief.

I watched Alice with suspicion.

“In my unworthy state, I am humbled to meet Your Highness, the Princess.
I am Alice Carroll, the Student Council President.”

“S-student Council President?! How did you come here…?”

“I heard you had a rough time during your duel… I was informed. So, I’ve
come on behalf of the Student Council to visit you.”

“Ah…!”

“You, you didn’t have to do that?!”

White was just as flustered as I was, but her eyes shone like stars. It
seemed she was inwardly happy to meet the respected Student Council
President up close.

Alice was adored by many students. White was no exception.

Alice placed a basket filled with fruits and a get-well gift, on the
cabinet next to the bed.

White was relieved that there were no red apples.

‘So it’s on behalf of the Student Council.’

I think I understood the meaning behind those words. She probably didn’t
want to make a big deal out of it.

“How is your health?”

“I’m, I’m okay…! More importantly, um…”

From her reaction, it seemed White too quickly understood why Alice had
come all this way in person.

“I’m not sure if this is what you’re worried about, but… please don’t
worry! Nothing will happen on a national level. What happens at the
academy should stay within the academy.”

***That’s something I taught her before. She’s making good use of it.***

“It’s just because I was weak that this happened… I don’t think badly of
it. Anyway, thank you for coming, Student Council President.”

“Heh. Thank you. I am deeply moved by Your Highness’s generous
understanding.”

“Ah, ehehe. It’s not like my understanding is anything special…”

Merlin and I just watched them blankly. A boring yet heartwarming
conversation followed.

Then, at the right moment, Alice checked the clock tower in the distance
through the window. It seemed like she was timing her departure.

“…Ah, look at the time. I should be going now. It was an honor to have a
conversation with Your Highness in my unworthy state.”

“Uh?! Oh, no!!”

White shook her head and arms so vigorously it could have left
afterimages.

Unworthy state? White vehemently denied it, but Alice just smirked as if
she found it amusing.

Alice bowed slightly and said, “Then,” as a goodbye, and White expressed
her thanks, “Thank you for coming.”

And so, Alice walked towards the exit.

***So she’s just leaving like that. It’s a relief that nothing serious
happened.***

***That’s what I thought, when…***

“Ah.”

Alice stopped in her tracks in front of the door, as if she had just
remembered something.

She turned her head back and our eyes met.

“It was nice to meet you, Baby. You’re as adorable as always.”

Alice smiled brightly.

This bastard. Of course, she wouldn’t let this opportunity pass by
quietly.

As if to say it was up to me to deal with the aftermath, she dropped
that bomb and left the hospital room with ease.

Suddenly, an unexpected and uncomfortable atmosphere began to swirl
around.

I couldn’t turn my head in either direction. A bead of cold sweat rolled
down my cheek.

Because White and Merlin were staring at me with faces filled with
shock.

<span id="0170_172_Fury__Interlude_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 172: Fury — Interlude (3)
=================================

**༺ Fury – Interlude (3) ༻**

The memory of beating Priestess Miya was still vividly clear in my mind.

There were many things to reflect on, like being irrational or imprudent
despite having Alice as an enemy.

***Well, what can be done?***

It was unbearable.

Even if I could return to the past, I would repeat the same actions. I
didn’t have a shred of regret about defeating Miya.

Fortunately, White seemed to feel relieved after hearing about Miya. The
fact that I actually beat her seemed to surprise her.

However, it was hard to predict what effect it would have on White, as
the duel with Miya made her painfully aware of her own shortcomings.

I only hoped that it stimulated her motivation and had a positive effect
on her growth.

White decided to focus on recovery and expressed her intention to
forfeit all subsequent duels.

There were a few other students like White who needed a few days to
recover. They did the same.

Suddenly, some students who lost their duel opponents were paired by the
academy with others of similar skill levels.

The duel evaluation proceeded smoothly as if nothing had happened.

‘Alice…’

…Intruded to a frightening extent.

I never expected her to come to visit White and use terms of endearment
like “Baby” or “You’re as adorable as always” towards me.

Naturally, White and Merlin pressed me for answers.

I honestly answered, ‘I don’t know why that senior behaves like that.’

Of course, I knew the reason. She must have suspected that I was the
Nameless Hero and was likely trying to probe me for the answer by
drawing me in with her friendly demeanor.

In reality, compared to Alice, the Nameless Hero was pitifully weak.

But on the outside, there seemed to be no one as fearsome and strong.

So, Alice must have approached with caution while employing her charms.

When I said, ‘I don’t know why Alice is doing this,’ it was because I
didn’t expect it to be this severe.

White and Merlin each made their own misunderstandings, thinking the
Student Council President had taken a liking to me.

─Even the Student Council President… Senior Isaac is becoming more
terrifying…!

When White exclaimed that, I felt dizzy. They thought Luce had taken a
liking to me.

White and Merlin whispered behind my back with conversations like ‘Is
this the appearance of a rival?’ and ‘This is getting interesting.’

Thus, the situation where Alice appeared to have unilaterally taken a
liking to me became a source of enjoyable gossip for them. It was as if
they were like housewives watching a morning drama.

“Ha!”

An arrogant snicker snapped me out of my thoughts.

On the last day of the duel evaluation.

On the dueling grounds, where all eyes were focused, I was lightly
warming up.

I stopped warming up only after the vain blond noble, Tristan Humphrey,
climbed up to face me.

“Indeed, you’re the kind that loosens up your body before your mind.
There’s no other freak like you in the Magic Department.”

As the person ranked ahead of him, Tristan knew my fighting style very
well. I could feel that acutely.

He meticulously observed and analyzed the fighting style of those
stronger than himself, pondering how he could defeat them.

His obsession with victory felt as blatantly burdensome as his
uncomfortable stare…

“Really? I never thought about it that way.”

I responded casually, tapping my shoulder with Zhonya Staff which I held
in my hand.

Come to think of it, Ian Fairytale, who dreamt of becoming a magic
knight, didn’t seem to warm up before duels either.

***Am I the only one?***

“…Enough small talk. Isaac, today you’ll have to give up that ranking.
This body, stronger than ever before, will bring you a miserable defeat!
Hahahaha!!”

Tristan laughed vigorously like a third-rate villain, then suddenly
choked and coughed.

Having been acknowledged by him while attending the same class, he
didn’t seem so bothersome, which was why I snickered.

After all, I was just a nobody who got stronger quickly with the help of
the status window.

The thought naturally arose that I had to seriously engage with the goal
he was chasing.

I narrowed my eyes, slightly bowing my head.

I grasped the end of my round glasses and took them off.

At the same time, an icy chill began to spew from my body.

I concentrated.

I lifted my head again, opened my eyes wide, and glared at Tristan.

“Come at me.”

Upon hearing my calm remark, Tristan smirked.

My cold mana contaminated the mild air.

Tristan felt the cold pressing down on his skin and a chilling sensation
running down his spine.

He raised wind to counter my cold.

His expression showed a desire to fight me right away.

Soon, the referee declared the start of the duel.

My ice magic clashed with Tristan’s wind magic.

\* \* \*

The judges and students watched the duel with their mouths agape.

Isaac and Tristan were engaged in an intense and astonishing exchange.

It hardly seemed like a fight belonging to the Magic Department.

Nor did it seem like a fight from the Knight Department, as various
combat techniques were exchanged between the two.

Constant analyses, predictions, and movements were carried out. There
was no time for hesitation.

They moved at a speed that was difficult to follow with the naked eye,
dodging attacks, and countering.

The pale chill and the mild wind danced grandly and dazzlingly above the
dueling grounds.

Tristan’s mana control was at an astonishing level.

The blond noble enveloped himself with wind, using its power to move at
fierce speeds, like a diving falcon.

Such movement required incredibly precise control of mana. Merely
watching could make one nauseous.

Furthermore, Tristan’s punches and kicks were accompanied by an
explosion of enhanced wind mana, which resulted in tremendously powerful
attacks.

Those watching the duel could only guess how much effort and perhaps
even physical discomfort Tristan endured to reach such a level.

Isaac, opposing Tristan Humphrey, was equally as astonishing.

He tracked Tristan’s incredible speed with his eyes and adeptly
countered his attacks.

Even as rapid wind strikes were unleashed, Isaac did not falter.

This silver-blue-haired student was none other than the most improved
student of the first year and a genius, the man who overpowered the
Priestess of Horan.

That student was a monster in his own right.

*Thud─!*

Isaac and Tristan each landed a punch on each other’s face.

It happened in the blink of an eye. Most students could not comprehend
when the two had even reached each other.

The judges and the students seated in the spectator stands watched with
wide eyes, engrossed in the battle between the two.

*Boom──!*

From the fists swung by Isaac and Tristan, ice and wind mana exploded,
delivering powerful blows to one another. Their combat techniques were
similar.

A cold mana explosion occurred, and both were flung to opposite sides,
rolling several times across the dueling grounds.

*Boom!*

Isaac conjured an ice block and collided with it, preventing his body
from being thrown out of the dueling grounds.

Whoosh!

Tristan quickly generated wind around his body to correct his posture
and then whipped his head up.

Thus, both stood up from the dueling ground floor and stared each other
down.

Tristan, bleeding from his mouth and nose, chuckled merrily, saying,
“Heh, not bad at all!”

Isaac, wiping the blood from his nose and standing up, displayed a cold
determination contrary to his usually gentle demeanor.

Immediately, both gritted their teeth and charged at each other again.

“What on earth are those kids…?”

The middle-aged female judge, looking through the records, spoke with a
trembling voice, her amazement was unceasing.

“Tristan’s combat technique has completely changed since last semester.
Even I can’t do that… How much must he have pushed himself to be able to
do that…?”

“It’s Märchen Academy, after all. A place where the geniuses among
geniuses, and the freaks among freaks gather to compete. Nothing strange
about it.”

The elderly male judge next to her answered with a smile.

“Even so, those two are a completely different type of genius compared
to a genius who wields tremendous magic like Luce Eltania, right? That
alone is surprising, but Isaac too… That student really seems like the
craziest student in this academy…”

The female judge looked again at Isaac and Tristan. The two were
unleashing magic at each other.

“Is this record correct? How can that be the mana of a Grade E,
essentially the weakest student in the academy…? To have defeated an
opponent with Grade S mana, and to deal with such invisible attacks as
if it were natural…”

“It’s quite a peculiar sight, isn’t it?”

“Yes?”

The male judge chuckled heartily.

“The reason I haven’t been able to leave teaching at this age is
precisely because of students like them.”

Isaac and Tristan’s magic and fists, the time of their training,
intersected.

Bleeding, vomiting, crying, sometimes even fainting… days spent sweating
profusely, straining their muscles to the point of cramps, and living
with every ounce of their dying strength.

They relentlessly unleashed upon each other.

“Look at this. Really… Isn’t it a heart-pounding spectacle?”

The female judge looked at Isaac and Tristan, lost in thought.

Wrapped so intensely in wind magic, Tristan must be feeling severe agony
by now.

But he did not stop. He had already become weary of such pain.

Instead, he laughed heartily, “Hahahaha!” trying to forget the pain.

Isaac, still focused, tracked Tristan’s movements with his eyes.

*Whoooo───!*

*Clatter───!*

*Kwaah───!*

After drawing Tristan into motion with \[Rock Avalanche\], Isaac swiftly
followed up with a \[Frost Wave\].

Suddenly reaching Tristan, he cast \[Frost Explosion\], detonating his
ice mana to conclude the duel.

Above the dueling ground, swathed in swirling cold, Isaac’s breath
turned into white frost, whisked away by the wind.

The ice imprisoning Tristan dispersed into a faint blue mana.

Frozen to the bone, Tristan, now a bloodied mess, collapsed onto the
dueling ground with a thud.

“Duel over! Class B Isaac wins!”

The referee declared the end of the duel.

Cheers and applause from the students poured out, as the duel presented
by Isaac and Tristan was greatly admired.

The medical team rushed over with a stretcher. Amidst this, Tristan
coughed up blood, regaining consciousness.

“Not yet… not yet…”

Tristan, with trembling hands, tried to push himself off the ground to
stand up, but…

As the aftereffects of fighting enveloped in wind hit his whole body, he
lost his strength and collapsed to the ground. It was an overload.

Isaac quietly looked down at him.

Tristan kept trying to get up as if he could still fight, falling each
time. Saliva and blood mixed, dripping from his mouth like mucus.

The memories of training that filled his head were trying to lift his
body.

It was his uninteresting and desperate chronicle, running toward the
dream of becoming a great wizard someday.

Isaac closed his eyes and silently sighed.

To offer a hand here would be an insult to Tristan, who had been chasing
him with blood and sweat.

Pity would only poison him more.

So, the only thing he could say now was just one.

Isaac opened his eyes again and said in a sarcastic voice,

“I won, Tristan.”

As those words settled, Tristan stopped in his tracks.

Only then could Isaac turn his back.

“I’ll receive the evaluation later.”

Isaac said this to the judges, then put his glasses back on and left the
dueling grounds.

The medical team rushed past him.

Isaac deliberately did not look back and walked away in silence.

At that moment.

“Ha!”

The sound of Tristan’s confident chuckle.

Isaac paused and turned his head to look at him.

“S-student Tristan! You need to lie down here…!”

“You shouldn’t move!”

Tristan, with the help of the medical team, managed to sit up but
refused to get on the stretcher, causing the medical team trouble.

Indifferent, Tristan, his face smeared with blood, chuckled. His
laughter was tinged with a gurgling sound, perhaps due to blood in his
throat.

“Indeed… I acknowledge…! Right now, you are stronger than me…! But!!”

His tone was like that of a third-rate villain.

Tristan deliberately lifted his chin and showed off a smile full of
arrogance.

His haughty voice resounded loudly on the dueling grounds.

“If that’s all you’ve got, it won’t be long! Soon, I will! Crush you!!
Hahahah!!”

Tristan laughed heartily, then suddenly choked, coughing violently.
Blood splattered on the floor.

Tristan empirically understood the painful training time Isaac had gone
through.

Wondering how many agonizing days that damned guy had spent climbing
from the weakest Grade E to his current state.

Not being able to beat Isaac must have been due to training less than
him.

Then, to not lose to Isaac, to surpass him,

he would have had to work harder, shedding more blood and sweat.

No matter how frustrating, he had to move forward without getting
discouraged.

Isaac, with a gentle face, gave a small smile, turned his head, and left
the place.

Tristan’s laughter gradually subsided. Soon, his eyes rolled back, and
he lost consciousness.

Chapter 173: To My Dearest Benefactor (1)
=========================================

**༺ To My Dear Benefactor (1) ༻**

The faint smell of earth was in the air. It was a damp smell.

Gloomy rain clouds cast a thick shroud over the academy. Thunder
rumbled, and raindrops pelted down.

Just then, I went under the hospital porch.

I lifted my head, wiped my damp glasses, and headed towards the
entrance.

“Oh? Senior Isaac!”

Then, someone leaving the academy hospital recognized me and approached
me.

A first-year male student with grayish-blue hair and a sly look. It was
Abel Carnedas.

He came up to me all of a sudden, smiling broadly.

“Wow! To think I’d meet a celebrity here! You remember me, right?!”

“From the joint practical evaluation, correct?”

“Ha, truly, such memory is befitting of an honor student from the Magic
Department! It’s an honor that you would remember someone like me!”

***What’s with him and this cringey flattery?***

“I heard you defeated the Priestess! The rumor has even spread to the
Knight Department! It was really surprising to hear! Isaac from the
Magic Department overpowered the Priestess with the power of the
Nine-tailed Fox purely based on his combat sense. Wow. Just how
extraordinary must the person I’ve faced be?!”

“Uh, right. Thanks…”

I laughed awkwardly. It was a bit too much, but I already knew Abel’s
personality, so it didn’t bother me much.

Then, Abel seemed to remember something suddenly, his eyes sparkled, and
he bowed respectfully.

“Oh, I almost forgot! Greetings to you respected senior, Isaac! I’m Abel
Carnedas, a first-year in the Knight Department. My sister is your
classmate.”

“Ciel Carnedas?”

“Yes, that’s right! You know her!”

Abel lifted his head and gave a sly smile.

His cheerful voice and manner were in stark contrast to Ciel Carnedas.

She always carried a pillow around, living as though merely being alive
was sufficient reason to keep going.

“Where are you headed?”

“My mentee is hospitalized, so I came to visit.”

“Ah, you mean Princess Snow White. I came to see a friend. Haha.”

After the duel evaluation in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, a visit to the
academy hospital would reveal Roanna, who was hospitalized because of
her duel.

Currently Abel’s friend, Roanna was a female student in the Knight
Department who would eventually become his lover.

So, I wasn’t at all curious why Abel had stopped by the academy
hospital. I think I wouldn’t have been curious even if I hadn’t known.

Soon, Abel scratched his head as if he had just remembered something and
gave an awkward laugh.

“Oops, it seems I’ve held you up too long… Sorry about that. Anyway, it
was exceedingly pleasant to see you, Senior Isaac!”

“It’s okay. I was glad to see you too.”

“I’m glad to hear that! Haha. May I greet you again next time?”

“Anytime.”

I answered with a smile. Abel exclaimed, “Oooh!” and seemed overjoyed as
if he was about to jump.

***This…***

I inwardly understood why guys like Tristan always had followers around
them.

Abel was quite dramatic, but the flattery definitely felt good. I
couldn’t help but puff my chest out a bit.

“Thank you! Please go safely!”

“Yeah, take care on your way.”

Abel passed by me with a bright smile, intending to leave.

Just in case, I decided to say something.

“Abel.”

“Yes!”

Before Abel left the shelter of the building’s porch…

I looked at him and said…

“Take care of yourself.”

“…?”

Abel just stared at me blankly, as if he wasn’t sure what I meant.

“Huh…? Ah, yes! Understood!”

It seemed he took my words as a simple, “Take care.”

“Then!”

Abel then conjured a \[Flame Curtain\] around himself to move forward
through the rain.

“…”

I smiled. It was clear at a glance what that sly guy was thinking.

It seemed Abel secretly wanted to fight me.

He was eager to fight and win against me somehow. How could I not notice
his competitive spirit?

The time he competed against me during the joint practical evaluation
must have left a clear mark on him, turning into motivation for his
growth.

“He’ll probably cling to me for a while.”

Of course, I had no intention whatsoever of opening up to someone who
hid their true intentions like that.

The reason I lied to Kaya about being strong against demons since the
first year, was because I didn’t want to hand over my weaknesses to
others, to place them in hands beyond my control. I had to be cautious.

If I was like this even toward those I care about, imagine how it would
be with someone like Abel. If he came close, I’d just draw a line
appropriately and respond with a sociable smile.

With those thoughts in mind, I entered the academy hospital.

Upon entering White’s private room, Merlin was the first to greet me. We
bowed to each other in greeting.

“White!”

“Senior Isaac!”

As I waved with a smile, White welcomed me with open arms.

***So cute.***

I sat beside the bed. While creating \[Frostfire\] with my fingers and
repeated light training exercises, I taught White some lessons.

Next to us was a plate of clumsily cut fruit done by Merlin. However,
White didn’t eat a single piece and focused entirely on her studies.

So, when I handed over a piece of fruit with a fork, White, without
taking her eyes off the book, simply stuck out her mouth and bit into
the fruit eagerly.

Fortunately, White’s spirit was not broken by the duel with the
Priestess Miya. She knew she had her shortcomings and was prepared to
move on from the defeat. The fact that I had utterly defeated Miya also
played a part.

If anything, it was Miya who was mentally shaken.

She must have considered herself the top genius in this world, yet she
was unilaterally defeated by someone like me despite a significant
difference in mana. A loss to monsters like Luce, Dorothy, or Alice
wouldn’t have been nearly as significant.

Moreover, while she didn’t summon the Nine-tailed Fox against me, the
fact that she even considered invoking the Nine-tailed Fox’s summoning
circle… must have severely wounded her pride.

‘But it’s quiet.’

For some reason, Miya was silent. Eerily quiet.

The situation was different from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱. In the game,
Ian Fairytale had beaten Miya, but he had to receive healing magic for
several days due to severe burns all over his body.

Perhaps for that reason, Miya was merely annoyed and refrained from
causing any further harm to Ian. After all, he was already sufficiently
injured.

But I defeated Miya cleanly without a single injury. Given her
personality, she would have sought revenge, yet her excessive silence
was puzzling.

Of course, even if it was puzzling, using \[Clairvoyance\] to check on
Miya for such a reason wouldn’t be a good idea.

Even if not to the extent of Cheshire, Mae also had a keen sense for
detecting gazes.

The reason Miya could deal with all sorts of assassination plots with
ease, reigning like a tyrant in Horan, was largely due to the
Nine-tailed Fox.

***So, let’s refrain from using \[Clairvoyance\] against her unless
absolutely necessary.***

The next scenario of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ was 「Act 8, The
Priestess of the Red Lotus」

A demon was hidden within Miya’s shadow.

It seemed \[Demon Detection\] didn’t work since it had already
integrated with the shadow in the form of mana. Only when it reveals
itself would \[Demon Detection\] function properly.

‘But by then, it would be too late.’

The shadow demon had a unique skill called ‘Total Plunder.’

When Miya had absorbed the power of the Nine-tailed Fox, reaching the
pinnacle of her power.

The shadow demon would infest Miya and steal her power, due to
possessing dark mana as well, it became an entity far superior to Miya.

In the end, the ‘Shadow Priestess’ wielding the power of the Nine-tailed
Fox became the final boss of Act 8.

“Right, how’s the watch? You always carry it in your pocket, don’t you?”

“Ah, this? Yes, it’s fine. I kept it in a magic pouch.”

White rummaged through the magic pouch she carried and pulled out a
platinum pocket watch.

When she opened the lid, the still hands of the watch were immediately
noticeable.

“I’ve been using storage magic on it since I dropped it. You
remembered…”

White was speaking with a smile, but her expression hardened as she
looked at the watch.

“…Huh?”

The face of the pocket watch was originally designed to resemble the
universe, captivating those who saw it with its vivid beauty.

However, for some reason, the Milky Way and starlight were fading, and a
dark blackness was encroaching on part of the face.

“Why is this happening…?”

“What’s wrong, White?”

“The watch… It wasn’t like this until recently… Could it be because I
put it in the magic pouch?”

White stuttered, seemingly flustered.

‘As expected.’

I had anticipated it would come to this.

White’s pocket watch was originally meant to suddenly stop during
Semester 2 Year 2.

So, the reason why the watch stopped prematurely remained unknown.

However, seeing darkness encroach on the face of the watch like that
made one thing clear.

The final boss of Semester 1 Year 3, ‘Mephisto the Contractor,’ who was
also the agent of the Evil God, was already on the move.

The darkness invading the face of the pocket watch signified the gradual
unleashing of a demon stronger than the Floating Island, it was a
process of loosening the reins that bound it.

The demon was a mystery surpassing the 9-star level of world
destruction, a demon that transcends even Providence. ‘The Abyss.’

Reflecting on the information from ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, at this
rate, there was a high chance that The Abyss would appear during
Semester 2 Year 2.

‘Then, I must…’

***What should I do?***

“Senior Isaac? What are you thinking about?”

Lost in thought for a moment, White and Merlin looked at me with eyes
full of curiosity.

I shook my head as if to say it was nothing.

“Just wondering about the watch. I know a master craftsman in the market
who’s good at repairing watches. Let’s go see him later.”

“Ah, that’s… Thank you for the offer, but it’s okay. I don’t really want
to get it repaired.”

“Why?”

White gazed at the pocket watch with a distant look on her face.

“It was a gift from my mother. If it’s not completely broken, I’d rather
no one else touch it.”

“I see.”

White had survived numerous assassination attempts from her mother.

The only motive for her mother’s murder attempts was out of jealousy for
her daughter’s beauty. White was well aware of that ridiculous fact.

But the platinum pocket watch held a very special meaning to White. It
was the only gift she had received from her mother.

It was the only clue that allowed her to barely believe that there was
even a speck of love from her mother towards her.

She probably never imagined that the watch could bring a fate worse than
death.

The bad ending 「Eternity」. It was the worst ending that the pocket
watch could bring if things went wrong.

White’s mother didn’t love her daughter at all. She only wished for her
daughter’s misery out of sheer jealousy.

Only I and Mephisto knew this fact.

“Well… I never thought it would stay fine forever. Everything loses its
shine with time, after all. It’s okay.”

White let out an awkward laugh and put the pocket watch back into her
magic pouch.

“…”

Merlin and I looked at White with half-open eyes.

White looked back at us quickly, puzzled.

“Why are you both looking at me like that…?”

“No, just… It seemed like quite the atmospheric thing to say, especially
coming from Princess White.”

It really didn’t fit her usual crybaby image.

“Ah, ehehe. Maybe I’ve grown a bit since coming to the academy.”

White smiled contentedly.

Since Merlin responded on my behalf, I held back from saying anything.
It felt awkward to chime in.

“White, here.”

“Ah. Woah.”

I deliberately offered her a piece of fruit with a fork, wearing a
subtle smile.

Without hesitation, White brought the fruit I offered into her mouth.

<span id="0172_174_To_My_Dear_Benefactor_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 174: To My Dear Benefactor (2)
======================================

**༺ To My Dear Benefactor (2) ༻**

Her pink hair was braided and twisted on both sides.

A female student in a school uniform with a white veil over her head
strolled through the old academy grounds with an escort priest.

It was Bianca Anturaze, the Saintess of the Helize Church, and her
escort, Sylon.

This was the old Märchen Academy campus, a place where only those
registered through the Marks Treaty were allowed to roam freely.

It was the site of a major incident last semester when the legendary
magic beast, the Thunderbird, was dominated by a demon.

The scenery was like ruins. Sylon felt a strange premonition, it was as
if he was left in a doomed world with no one but the Saintess by his
side.

Was it because no budget was allocated for maintenance? Crumbled
buildings were seen here and there. Bianca ignored them and hastened her
steps.

“Sylon, do you think there are traces of the Nameless Hero here?”

Bianca, with her eyes closed as if she were squinting, asked Sylon.

Her beautiful voice blended exquisitely well with her solemn tone.

“I’m sorry, I’m not sure.”

“I didn’t ask expecting you to know. I meant for you to give your
opinion.”

“Yes, if that’s the case… I wonder if there might be something at the
place where the Nameless Hero fought the Thunderbird. That building…
seems to be the place. How about we go over there?”

Sylon pointed towards the top of a high hill.

A castle-shaped building, half of which was severely damaged, laid there
in isolation.

The beautiful red castle, Carly Hall, which once symbolized Märchen
Academy.

It was the place where Isaac fought against Vera the Summoner, her
minions, and the Thunderbird.

“Alright. Let’s go there.”

Bianca and Sylon headed towards Carly Hall.

She was searching for traces of the Nameless Hero in order to track him
down.

There was only one purpose for doing so, she wanted to become comrades
with the Nameless Hero.

She was a human born with the light element, she was the Saintess of
Helize Church serving the Lord Manhalla. That was why she enrolled in
Märchen Academy, intending to personally exterminate demons.

After witnessing the Nameless Hero’s overwhelming power firsthand, she
guessed that nothing could be done against him.

Thus, if she became an ally of the Nameless Hero, she would have the
opportunity to kill demons as well.

Indeed, killing demons. Was that not the duty of a Saintess born with
the element of light? It was about faithfully fulfilling the duty given
by the Lord Manhalla.

With such intentions, Bianca was searched for the Nameless Hero.

Before long, the two reached the front of the hill.

“Holy Saintess, I will lift you up…”

“It’s okay. Let’s just walk.”

Just like that, the two climbed the hill and reached Carly Hall. Sylon
panted heavily, but Bianca’s breathing was stable as if her stamina had
not been affected at all.

Carly Hall. Upon closer inspection, it was even more devastated. Vines
full of life were creeping upon the scene.

The completely shattered exterior and the crater allowed one to infer
that something huge had fallen, smashing the building and embedding
itself into the ground.

Bianca and Sylon realized that a fierce battle, far beyond their level,
had taken place there.

Bianca momentarily thought that Carly Hall, once a symbol of the old
Märchen Academy campus, should at least have been rebuilt.

However, she soon shook her head in understanding of the academy’s
situation.

Last year, due to the emergence of various demons, many investors would
have left.

Märchen Academy would not have had the financial means to restore Carly
Hall in such a situation.

Only after the number of investors increased and a period of stability
was reached would there finally be room to repair the old academy
grounds.

…That was not an interesting story at all. Bianca decided to stop
pondering such pointless thoughts.

She looked up at the half-destroyed part of the building. The top floor.
A single altar was precariously perched on a section that remained
intact.

“Did the Nameless Hero defeat the Thunderbird here…? Hmm?”

Bianca noticed something odd near the altar, on the wall.

Light elemental power, \[Eyes of Light\]. A unique ability possessed
only by Bianca in this world.

No matter how difficult it was to detect, as long as it was within the
realm that humans could perceive, she would be able to distinguish the
shape of mana.

An astonishingly intricate spell was cast on the wall. It was a
high-level spell that no one else could have noticed.

Although she could barely recognize the shape of the mana, she could not
discern the true nature of the spell.

Bianca moved without hesitation.

“Will you lift me up there?”

“Understood.”

Bianca and Sylon ascended to the top of the half-destroyed building with
wind magic.

The two landed in front of the altar.

Bianca gently swept her hand across the wall and abruptly stopped at the
place where she felt a strange sensation.

Bianca tapped on the wall, and then, with a few knocks, a hollow sound
was heard.

“Sylon. Inside this, it’s empty.”

“Yes…? Holy Saintess?!”

Bianca slightly infused divine power, and she began to be absorbed into
the wall. Small ripples spread across the wall centered around her body.

As Bianca passed through the wall in an instant, Sylon, startled,
hurriedly followed her.

“…!”

As if there was never anything there, Sylon’s body easily passed through
the wall.

“Where… is this…?”

Suddenly, a musty smell assaulted their nostrils. A cramped and
dilapidated secret library came into Sylon’s view.

Glowing lamps were hung on the walls, casting a soft light, allowing
Bianca and Sylon to make out their surroundings.

Sylon looked around with a surprised expression. The swirling clusters
of dust glowed yellow under the light of the fluorescent lamps.

As he carefully touched the book on the shelf, he could feel the dusty
texture of the book.

“…”

“Holy Saintess…? Huh?”

Bianca followed up and touched the books placed on the shelf.

Her hand, imbued with divine power, naturally passed through the books.
It was the divine power that revealed the books to be remnants of magic.
This startled Sylon.

Without divine power, one’s senses would be deceived into feeling and
reading the books, which would contain irrelevant information directly
formed from the reader’s mind.

Bianca frowned. Should this be considered illusion magic? No, it was
different.

Magic that had already far surpassed common sense. It was so exceptional
that it brought into question whether it was something humans could use.

Bianca walked deeper into the library and looked down at a book placed
on an old desk that seemed as though it would fall apart at any moment.

***This one is definitely tangible.***

“This book… It’s influenced by a power, not of this world. Time is
distorted within it.”

Bianca’s eyes widened slightly, revealing her white, lightless irises.

She was visually impaired. Her physical eyes had already lost their
function and she could not see.

It was Divine Power that had granted her mystical vision.

“Not of this world…?”

When Sylon asked in confusion, Bianca extended her hand toward the old
book without answering.

When she used a 2-star light spell, \[Purification\], holy light flowed
from her palm.

The dust on the book illuminated by the light vanished instantly.

“Even space-time has no meaning before this book. It’s not written in
the same era as ours, at least. It’s from a place far, far away.”

In Bianca’s vision, the last moments of a woman who had dedicated the
remainder of her life to writing this book faintly appeared.

Bianca did not know the identity of that woman.

Nor could she have known where that woman had gone.

Bianca picked up the book and examined its contents.

Pages stained with hardened blood.

Letters inscribed in a swirling manner alongside incomprehensible
drawings.

“Sylon.”

“Yes.”

“Can you read these letters?”

Bianca held the book’s edge with both hands and showed it to Sylon.

“I’m sorry, I don’t know them… Could it be an ancient language?”

Bianca and Sylon could not read the characters inscribed in the book.

“…We must recover this book.”

“Would that be okay?”

“No matter how you look at it, this book is not ordinary. The Helize
Church… No, it would be better if I kept it. There must be a holy reason
why the Lord Manhalla has led me here.”

With a composed face, Bianca placed her index finger on her lips.

“So, I would like it if today’s events remained a secret.”

“…I will do as you command.”

Sylon bowed his head. Having vowed to serve only the Saintess, he would
absolutely obey Bianca’s commands.

The book written in Hangul thus passed into the possession of Saintess
Bianca Anturaze.

**To my dear Benefactor.**

I hope you have found this book.

I ask for your understanding that circumstances prevent me from
assisting you as much as I would like.

Before I lose my sanity, I hope you will come to know every truth in
this world.

After reading this book, immediately seek out the Tower Master of the
Hegel Magic Tower, please.

She will surely become your ally.

──────── Sincerely.

“Senior Isaac, what are you looking at?”

As Isaac quietly watched the rain clouds outside the window, White, who
was nibbling on a mana pudding bar, asked.

“Just, I noticed the rain had stopped.”

“Ah, must have been a shower.”

It was a trivial conversation.

The clouds gradually cleared. I decided to say goodbye to White and
Merlin and leave the hospital room.

“I’ll be going. Make sure to review what you learned today. I’ll test
you on it as soon as you’re discharged tomorrow.”

“All of it…?”

“Can’t do it?”

“Oh, no! I can do it!”

As White forced a laugh and shouted confidently, I smirked and left the
hospital room.

Just before closing the door to the hospital room, I saw White’s face
with tears welling up in her eyes, seemingly overwhelmed by when she
would finish and memorize all the assignments I had given.

Ignoring it, I hastened my steps.

Upon leaving the academy hospital, a cluster of stars in the sky caught
my eye.

It was time to prepare for Chapter 8 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Chapter 175: Conspiracy (1)
===========================

**༺ Conspiracy (1) ༻**

There were many beautiful women around Isaac.

This was one of the things that had been bothering Kaya Astrea recently.

Luce Eltania and Dorothy Heartnova were already overwhelming enough…

…But with the addition of the Imperial Princess Snow White, who was
known throughout the continent for her beauty, Kaya was at a loss for
how to squeeze herself in.

It was an impregnable fortress.

The three girls clung to Isaac, giggling and sneering as if to mock her
for not having a place to fit in as they proclaimed Isaac as theirs.

But she couldn’t chase after Isaac, who was busy and always on the move.

Ever since Semester 1 Year 1, Kaya had struggled to suppress the urge to
chase after Isaac after he eradicated the Ant Demon.

Isaac had told her not to follow him. As an archwizard, he’d be able to
sense Kaya’s approach easily. But if she approached him outright, Isaac
would hate her because it would make him stand out.

Kaya was terrified of losing the affection of the one she loved.

So Kaya had been content with seeing and greeting Isaac, and sneaking
away with him for the occasional tactical meetings.

But it seemed that things couldn’t go on like this.

Luce Eltania ignored the students’ gazes and showed affection to Isaac.
It seemed like half the reason Kaya couldn’t approach Issac was because
of the top seat.

Especially since the disparity of her cold demeanor to others and her
affectionate demeanor towards Isaac created a gap that aided her
overwhelming charm. It was as if she was bestowing superiority to Isaac.

Dorothy Heartnova was a celebrity in the academy and an idol. Moreover,
she was a formidable force to be reckoned with across the entire
continent. She was someone who attended the academy with the goal of
‘having fun’ rather than learning.

Such a genius, caring for and cherishing Isaac more than anyone else,
left Kaya feeling suffocated.

Princess Snow White not only held the highest status of an ‘Imperial
Princess’ in the continent but was also arguably the most beautiful
woman on the continent. Such a person was spending time with Isaac every
day as his junior and mentee.

Kaya couldn’t guess how much their time together would strengthen the
bond between the two.

***Dangerous.***

Kaya felt an overwhelming sense of wariness.

“I need to come up with something.”

\[Countermeasures?\]

Late at night in Charles Hall, the top-ranked dorm.

Kaya tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep, and she stared at the
ceiling, muttering to herself.

Beside her was Dark Kaya, dressed in the same pajama, lying down and
staring at her. As a personality, she was only visible through Kaya’s
eyes.

Then, with a flash of her bloodshot eyes and a wicked grin, Dark Kaya
turned her face to the main body.

\[So you’re finally going to seduce Sir Isaac?\]

“T-that’s right…! I have to.”

Kaya looked determined. A drop of cold sweat dripped down her face.

Dark Kaya blushed and gave a sheepish smile.

\[I absolutely agree! You’re aiming for the strategy meeting with Isaac
tomorrow, right?\]

“Yeah, it doesn’t seem like there will be another chance for a while, so
I need to do something. A strong move…”

Kaya thought hard.

Isaac was running towards a certain goal, so he was avoiding having
romantic relationships.

***How do I get through someone like that?***

She made a plan with Dark Kaya.

Her imagination was filled with shameful acts with Isaac.

“…Huh?”

Suddenly, the morning sun came and sparrows were chirping.

Kaya got up, dark circles under her eyes. She looked out the window with
a bemused look.

***It’s morning already?***

She was puzzled.

\* \* \*

“I’ll be an honorary student council member.”

Behind the academy building.

I was standing alongside Alice Carroll in the shade, staying out of the
sun.

Before us was a small garden. It was rarely frequented by students, so
couples occasionally came here to be affectionate in private.

It was the kind of place that even the players of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ didn’t bother to stop by except to play Couple Breaker or take
game screenshots.

Meanwhile, I was training my mana mastery by circulating mana in my left
hand.

It was similar to those who walk around school squeezing a hand grip and
working out their forearm muscles for attention, or those who read books
as they walk.

I didn’t like it, but it couldn’t be helped. It had become a habit now,
and I felt empty without doing it.

Alice crossed her arms under her chest. She was wearing a white shirt
and school skirt, and it looked like she was supporting her prominent
chest with her arms.

Every unconscious gesture that flaunted her figure was a display of her
confidence in her appearance.

“Took you long enough.”

“I apologize for that.”

“I didn’t mean for you to apologize. It’s good to have you on my side,
if only for a little while.”

She was calm and collected.

There was no hint that she was actually happy. Her tone was that of a
nice senior.

“Just in case, I’m telling you that I’m not under you, Alice.”

“I know that. That’s what I said. So, do you remember the terms of
becoming an honorary student council member, Baby?”

I nodded.

Honorary Student Council.

Responsible for protecting the students in the event of a major event or
incident at the academy, and may temporarily exercise the authority of
the Student Council.

It was a position that was not chained to the Student Council chain of
command, and it allowed one to enjoy some benefits of the Student
Council. For me, it was nothing but a sweet deal.

Although I wasn’t technically a part of the Student Council, it didn’t
matter because I had no intention of becoming one.

Also.

Perhaps, Alice suspected me more deeply than anyone else.

Alice lured me into becoming an honorary student council member,
immediately identifying two benefits she could gain.

First, in the event of an incident or accident, she could keep a close
eye on me, assuming that I would make a bold move.

Whether I became an honorary student council member or not, Alice was
suspicious of me anyway.

Second, by meeting the conditions of becoming an honorary student
council member, I could increase the time she spent with me with
‘occasional dates.’

Throw in a bet that sounds like something out of a romance drama, and I
had a good justification.

Fortunately, Alice wasn’t a fool who acted recklessly like most demons.

Although it was a facade, the Nameless Hero was thought to be a powerful
archwizard who could trample over not just Alice but even Dorothy as if
they were ants. Monitoring the suspect would require risking your life.

It was a precarious and risky tightrope walk. One side was based on a
misunderstanding, but nonetheless, we stood upon it. We were prepared to
draw our weapons at any moment and kill each other.

So I organized my thoughts and made a pledge.

In this situation, I’d rather take the risk and get to the bottom of
Alice’s secret.

It was better to confront Alice than to wait and see what she would do.
I could use this situation to my advantage.

Besides, I was on a quest to defeat the Evil God, and I had already lost
once.

I relived the memory through the Trial of Sandstone. It took me a while
to get back to the past.

It seemed that if one didn’t survive for a certain period of time after
the Evil God destroyed the world, everything would come to an end.

‘It takes a while for the regression to be triggered.’

***Who, how? Why?***

I had no idea. The truth was likely hidden behind something I have yet
to discover.

One thing was clear, if I die, I regress.

So I should not leave anything behind. Every speck of dust should help
me on my journey.

I had to pursue the best outcome, not the most reasonable one.

Even if I do well until the Evil God appears, it would be all for naught
if I got defeated by her.

So, even if Alice Carroll was a villain I had to risk my life for, I
planned to get to know her.

***Who is Alice?***

***What kind of person is Alice?***

***What is her secret?***

“Al-”

I turned my head toward Alice and was about to talk to her, but I was
startled.

Her fingers opened the button of her shirt and she put her index and
middle finger between her chest. A faintly erotic apricot color was
visible.

She soon pulled out a magic pouch that was tucked between her chest.

‘Oh.’

It was unexpectedly marvelous.

Alice pulled a small case from the pouch, opened it, and held it out to
me, showing me the badge inside.

It was a silver badge with a tiny gem. A cross between a sword and a
grimoire.

“It’s a student council badge. Use it for your honorary student council
work. It’s against academy rules to wear it casually, however.”

I took the case, pulled out the badge, and examined it.

Nothing suspicious was installed on it. It was an ordinary badge with no
mana.

“There’s no induction ceremony. You’re not an official student council
and the honorary student council itself is on a trial basis. If you
want, we can do one by ourselves?”

“No, it’s fine. Thank you for your concern.”

I grinned. The acting was natural.

“Good boy.” Alice smiled and offered a handshake with her right hand.

“I’ll be counting on you in case of emergencies.”

“Likewise.”

I took Alice’s hand and shook it.

If anyone were to see this, it would just look like a warm scenario.

I was feeling dizzy like I was standing on thin ice.

To me, this handshake was not about working together.

But more like a challenge to uncover each other’s secrets and draw our
swords to fight to the death.

At that moment, Alice lightly scratched my palm with her index
fingernail, sending a tickling pleasure that made my body shiver
slightly.

***What?***

“Hee, is Baby ticklish? That’s good to know.”

“Senior…”

Alice chuckled mischievously when I glared at her. It was ridiculous.

“So, Baby.”

Alice suddenly pulled her hand down.

She stood on her tiptoes, pressed on my shoulder, and leaned in close.

‘Huh?’

I felt Alice’s breath. For a moment, I thought she was going to kiss me.

She whispered in an intimate tone.

“All that’s left to do is make you mine, huh?”

Alice locked eyes with me closely, flashing a relaxed, sweet smile.
Perhaps it was her finishing move, a triumphant smile?

She was quite composed.

I pretended to be dazed and watched her pull back with her short
characteristic ‘hee’ laugh.

“Sorry, I couldn’t stay with you longer, I have something to do. See you
next time, Baby.”

“Ah, yes… take care.”

Alice waved, turned, and walked away.

I looked at the student council badge that she gave me.

‘…At least it’s stylish.’

It was pretty cool.

I tucked the case with the badge in my inner pocket and walked away.

<span id="0174_176_Conspiracy_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 176: Conspiracy (2)
===========================

**༺ Conspiracy (2) ༻**

“Are you okay? You look pretty tired.”

“Ah? Yes, yes! I’m fine! I’m okay…!”

“…”

Usually, the place where I met Kaya Astrea was set.

Under the night sky, in a valley quite far from the academy grounds. The
sound of the stream flowing was quite comforting.

Kaya and I were sitting side by side on a small chair, with a glowing
lamp placed on a stand next to us.

I was holding a piece of parchment, explaining what would happen next
and how we should proceed. In other words, I came here to talk to her.

‘It should be safe since we’ve come this far.’

However, Kaya seemed unusually tired today.

Her head was nodding off and swaying. Today, she didn’t have her usual
twin tails, so her long green hair danced lightly around her head.

With deep dark circles under her eyes. It was clear she hadn’t slept
well.

From reading her psychology earlier, it seemed she hadn’t slept all
night.

She was probably fantasizing about doing all sorts of erotic things with
me in her imagination. I thought it was inevitable because she didn’t
have any experience with a man other than me, so I turned my head back
to the parchment.

After lifting my glasses, I spoke.

“The next opponent is the Priestess. More precisely, a demon hiding
within the shadow of the Priestess. Currently, it’s integrated with the
shadow so no one can touch it, but it’s also unable to do anything. It
will reveal itself when the Priestess uses her full power after
unleashing the Nine-tailed Fox. Oh, thank you.”

Kaya offered a piece of fruit from the side, and I ate it while keeping
my eyes on the parchment. She had brought the fruit in case we got
hungry.

Oh, it was well-cut. Even better than her sister, Merlin.

“The Priestess of the Eastern Nation. I’ve only heard stories. She was
the junior who competed against Isaac, right? My heart dropped hearing
Isaac won against the Priestess… I wondered if you had revealed
yourself.”

“That’s not the case. Not yet.”

“Not yet…”

I ate another piece of fruit from Kaya’s hand.

I hadn’t told Kaya why I hadn’t revealed my identity yet. I just vaguely
mentioned ‘there’s a reason.’

Of course, there was no identity to reveal in the first place. This was
just my full power.

I didn’t want to reveal any of my secrets in areas beyond my control, at
least until Alice was subdued…

…Even if it was the trustworthy Kaya.

The only reason I revealed most of my secrets to Dorothy was because I
was caught and had no choice.

Fortunately, Kaya didn’t pry too much, which was comforting. She was
definitely the person who trusted me more than anyone else.

“Anyway, the demon will use the Priestess’ power. And dark magic on top
of that, so assume it’ll be stronger than the Priestess.”

“I get the gist of it. We have to stop the shadow demon and protect the
people of the academy. That’s why you became an honorary student council
member. Being wary of insiders is a given… By the way, how strong is the
Priestess?”

“About Luce’s level when we were first years.”

“I see…”

Kaya had set Luce Eltania as her benchmark. She was curious who would be
stronger if she, who had become stronger, faced the freshman Luce.

“Ah. Isaac, this…”

“Ah, thank…”

Kaya offered another piece of fruit. I was thankful and brought my mouth
to eat it.

But for some reason, the piece of fruit started moving away, and a
seductive scent hit my nose, making me suspicious, so I turned my gaze
towards Kaya.

Her long green hair flowed down her back. Kaya tilted her head, closing
her eyes from a close distance.

Her lips awkwardly puckered, trembling nervously. She looked like
someone waiting for her first kiss with her first lover.

“…”

I almost kissed her. A trap well set and with a properly calculated
angle, even more shocking is that it wasn’t even done by Dark Kaya. She
must have gathered some courage.

It must be Dark Kaya’s instigation. It looked exactly like the kind of
prank she would play.

Wondering why our lips hadn’t after some time, Kaya cautiously opened
her eyes and our gazes met.

“What are you doing?”

An incredulous laughter escaped my mouth.

Kaya’s lips puckered down. Her face quickly turned bright red like a
ripe apple.

“Ack, ahh… this, uhm…!

“I-I’m sorry…!”

Kaya pulled her head back as fast as the wind and became rigid. Shame
and regret washed over her when her plan failed.

But her will did not fade. With a tearful expression, Kaya turned her
flushed face toward me.

“I-it’s been a while since we’ve been alone together… It’s nice… Feel
free to explore my lips as much as you want, anytime, just like before…!
I really don’t mind at all…!”

“…”

***When were we like this?***

I pitied her for sloppily trying to imitate Dark Kaya’s personality.

She was shamelessly seducing me, skillfully arousing my desires.

I wondered if she asked Dark Kaya to help her with those lines.

Even though they looked the same, she didn’t have Dark Kaya’s sexiness
and assertiveness. On the contrary, she was absolutely precious.

I couldn’t help but adore her either way.

“We haven’t done that before.”

I shook my head and replied calmly.

I drew a line. I stared at the parchment that contained our plan.

No matter what, romance was a serious matter. To defeat the Evil God, it
was necessary to put romance on hold for a while.

“That’s…!”

“You’re the one I trust the most.”

“What?”

I took off my glasses and wiped them on the hem of my shirt.

I spoke with a hint of anxiousness from not having seen each other in a
while, and a touch of honesty.

“I’ll miss you after we graduate from the academy, so don’t be sad that
we don’t see each other often.”

Kaya’s eyes widened even more. She jerked her head abruptly,
straightening her back.

Her green hair floated like it had been charged with static electricity.
Even her thoughts seemed to have stopped.

***I don’t know what will happen after defeating the Evil God.***

***Will I stay in this world or return to my original one?***

But I knew I would miss this girl. That was how much Kaya meant to me.

“Ah, huh…? Uhhh…?”

Kaya’s face turned bright red like she was about to burst.

Her eyes trembled, and her body fluttered like her eyes.

I was getting flustered, so I looked at Kaya and smiled awkwardly.

“Well, anyway…”

“Heee…!”

*Pooong.*

It seemed my smile unintentionally delivered the final blow, as Kaya
finally burst out. It was as if fireworks were going off over her bright
red head.

Suddenly, her body went limp and she fell back.

Unable to withstand the intense wave of embarrassment, she fainted.

“…Huh?”

I was flustered.

***I know she’s isn’t used to men, but to this extent…?***

“What? Kaya, are you okay?! Wake up! Hey!”

The situation looked serious.

I rushed to the collapsed Kaya.

I shook her shoulders and yelled at her repeatedly.

Kaya closed her eyes with a happy smile on her face as if she had no
care in the world.

She was 18 years old.

\* \* \*

“Pierre, did you finish the homework?”

“Are you free today? Do you want to hang out?”

“Pierre, can you help me with this? I can’t understand it\~.”

Lunchtime. Orphin Hall of the Magic Department, Classroom B.

If you were to pick the most popular male student among the first-year
students of the Magic Department, everyone would think of the same
person.

Pierre Flanche. A handsome man with fine beige hair and mysterious light
green eyes. He was one of Alice Carroll’s subordinates, the Clover
Paladin.

He always had a thoughtful smile like Alice.

And was close to the students thanks to his sociability.

He was also very skilled in magic and was in the running to become the
student council president.

He was particularly popular with the freshmen girls, having a popularity
comparable to Professor Fernando Frost. The girls were divided into two
factions, the cool-headed Fernando faction and the thoughtful Pierre
faction.

Every break time, female students flocked around the Clover Paladin,
Pierre. And with his pleasant demeanor, he kindly treated each one of
them, winning their favor.

“Why are you so busy, Pierre? I really want to repay you for teaching me
before. Do you really not have time today? Huh?”

A female student asked flirtatiously, placing her hand on Pierre’s broad
shoulder.

Pierre gently brushed her hand away and gave her a big smile.

“Yeah, I can’t today. I’m sorry.”

“Oh my, no! Don’t be sorry, Pierre. Just tell me when you’re free. Uhu.”

Just seeing Pierre’s face made the female student giggle with delight.

The jealous stares of the boys landed on Pierre.

‘So annoying.’

Everything felt cumbersome for Pierre.

He didn’t feel any attraction to any of the girls here. The vast age gap
made him feel like they were all children.

Having those kids cling to him and talking to him every day only filled
him with irritation and disgust. Pierre was not the type who enjoyed
playing with children.

“Girls, I need to go to the bathroom.”

Pierre flashed his handsome smile and stood up. The girls excitedly made
space for him, nodding eagerly with flushed faces.

Pierre walked out of the classroom. But he found the affectionate gazes
from the female students wherever he went, making him uncomfortable.

“Tsk.”

He clicked his tongue quietly so no one could hear him.

He was an outsider who came to Märchen Academy to slay the Black
Monster. It was essential for him to blend into the academy, create
allies, and drive out or assassinate the Black Monster. Good social
relations were crucial.

However, as expected, it was boring and troublesome.

He sometimes thought about living like the Heart Paladin, Shera
Hectorica.

But he was worried it would offend Queen Alice, so he had no choice but
to be careful with his actions.

“…”

Pierre made his way to an outside shelter. And he spotted a boy passing
through the outdoor corridor.

Silver-blue hair. Round glasses. It was the second year, Isaac.

Pierre shook his head.

Isaac was the one who one-sidedly defeated Priestess Miya during the
duel evaluation.

The way he fought was hot enough to boil Pierre’s desire for battle.

It was surprising that a student from the Magic Department, who dreamt
of becoming a wizard, would display such a combat style. Isaac’s duel
remained in Pierre’s mind even a week after the duel evaluations had
ended.

Even as he walked down the corridor, he never removed the magic tool
from his hand. He found him amazing, seeing him not waste even a little
bit of his time.

‘I want to fight him.’

***Will his combat style work on me? Will I be able to defend myself
against him?***

Pierre had been curious about this since the duel evaluation.

‘Moreover, that man is…’

The one Queen Alice suspected was the Black Monster. A target under
Queen Alice’s covert operations.

Eventually, Pierre couldn’t resist secretly investigating Isaac. Various
pieces of information about Isaac had been forming in Pierre’s mind.

He rummaged through information on Isaac. Then, suddenly, one thought
crossed Pierre’s mind.

‘What if I corner him?’

Not just for a duel.

What if I gave him a reason to fight ‘sincerely’ and at the same time
see if he was the Black Monster?

***Will that be okay?***

‘Yeah, that would be fine.’

Although there was a personal motive, ultimately, everything was for the
Kingdom. Isaac, that man, was suspected to be one of the obstacles.

So, it shouldn’t matter. Pierre thought of a justification to fight
Isaac.

That man would never dream of it. The fact that Pierre himself was a
follower of Alice Carroll and the Clover Paladin.

*Sneer.*

Pierre withdrew his gaze from Isaac and hastened his steps. For the
first time since he entered the academy, a sincere smile lingered on his
lips.

A passing male student saw this and was startled, keeping his distance.
He turned his gaze away, pretending not to see him.

\* \* \*

I sneaked a glance.

I immediately noticed that the Clover Paladin was staring at me.

A quick glance at his psychology let me know that he was planning a
silly scheme against me.

‘If that’s the case.’

***…I’ll use it against him.***

<span id="0175_177_Preparations_for_the_Grand_Festival_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 177: Preparations for the Grand Festival (1)
====================================================

**༺ Preparations for the Grand Festivals (1) ༻**

The sun rose early in the morning at Märchen Academy.

As the red sun peeked over the horizon, heralding the dawn. I woke up my
weary body and prepared for the day.

I started the day with a morning run. Just like how I used to recite
legal texts in my head when I was a law student, I reviewed what I
studied the night before by going through it in my head while jogging.

After jogging, I looked up the things I couldn’t remember in my book.
This method was very effective for memorization.

Since I maximized my \[Learning Efficiency\], it felt strange that I
could study well even when I was exhausted. If I had this body in Korea,
I would have easily passed the three major Korean national examinations.

I took a shower and walked out naked. The shower facilities in Elma
Hall, a middle-high-ranked dorm, were of much better quality than my
previous dorms.

As I wiped my soaked silver-blue hair with a tower, I stood in front of
a full-length mirror and looked at my body. Sure enough, I felt taller.
My proportions were better than before.

The baby form of Frost Dragon Hilde was rolling around on my desk. It
was a non-verbal signal for me to pet her, so I touched her belly and
she let out a cute ‘uhh’ sound. She was just like a dog. No, let me
rephrase that. She was like a puppy.

I changed into my school uniform. As I tied my necktie, I felt a slight
pressure on my neck.

It had been a while since I graduated from high school, but after
staying at the academy for over a year, I got used to wearing a uniform
again.

I walked out of Elma Hall and was greeted by Luce Eltania at the front
gate. Her beauty and reputation attracted the attention of many
students.

On days when her training at the Magic Tower didn’t overlap, we usually
went to school together.

I responded to Luce’s usual greeting, ‘How’s the weather today?’ and we
headed to the Magic Department building together.

We entered our respective classrooms and prepared for class.

I was holding a magic tool. It was essential to practice my mana mastery
in my spare time. In the meantime, I focused on improving my magic
proficiency by calculating various formulas in my head.

Calculating magic formulas was quite tiring, and I often got headaches
and felt exhausted in the beginning. It was a symptom of overusing my
brain. But I was used to it now, so it was fine.

“Appear like the wind, Professor Daisy.”

Daisy, the second-year Class B Professor, swung the classroom door open
and entered. It was a noisy entrance that didn’t look like the wind to
anyone.

Several students looked surprised as if they hadn’t gotten used to her
yet.

I placed my magic tool under my desk and turned to face Professor Daisy.

“Before we start the class, let me make an announcement.”

Professor Daisy slammed a textbook down on her desk.

She looked around the students with a serious face. She seemed to pause
to gauge their reaction.

At this time of year, everyone knew there was an event about to take
place. However, it wasn’t decided yet whether the plan would proceed, so
the students were skeptical.

This was due to the numerous events that had occurred since last year.
Demons had been appearing unexpectedly, after all.

Everyone wanted to enjoy a big event, but they were well aware that they
should refrain from festivals and events. It was always a pity for the
students.

The students looked at Professor Daisy with anticipation and worry.

Tension filled the room and the students swallowed dryly. Professor
Daisy was really taking her time.

And then.

Professor Daisy huffed and exclaimed in a powerful voice.

“Rejoice! In three weeks, it has been decided that the ‘Jeblem’ Grand
Festival will be held!”

*Waaaaaah!!!*

The students erupted in cheers at the long-awaited good news.

The male students stomped their chairs and roared, and the female
students squealed ‘Kyaaah!’ and let out strange noises that were a mix
of cheers and screams.

The classroom turned into a frenzy of excitement as the students
celebrated in different ways.

I didn’t celebrate since I already knew about it. I just sat quietly and
watched them rejoice.

Professor Daisy nodded in satisfaction, clearly pleased with their
reaction.

Grand Festival.

The Grand Festival was called ‘Jeblem’. It was an event that took place
once every three years.

According to the scriptures of the Helize Church, the Grand Festival was
created by humans, who had no way to repay the grace of the Lord,
Manhalla, intending to provide the deity with a pleasant spectacle.

In short, it was like the Olympics. The Jeblem would be held on a grand
scale in the Zelver Empire. A splendid festival would commence.

Since it would be scaled down here at Märchen Academy, it would be more
appropriate to call it a ‘sports festival’.

The Principal and the faculty must have agreed to hold the Jeblem
recently.

‘To boost the students’ morale.’

They must have strongly pushed for it.

Canceling all events would only demoralize the students.

Märchen Academy, which had developed a detailed defense system, decided
to carry on with some events to boost student morale.

And with Emperor Carlos on their side, they didn’t have to worry about
finances because of the demon issue.

There shouldn’t be much difficulty in holding the festival.

‘It was supposed to be held anyway.’

Chapter 8 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱「The Priestess of the Red
Lotus」, took place during the Grand Festival.

Incidentally, Alice Carroll, the Student Council President, knew that
the event would take place. The Clover Paladin also used that
information to concoct a scheme to fight me.

With the Paladin’s involvement, I had more formidable opponents to be
wary of.

However, their appearance wasn’t necessarily a detriment. Although I
couldn’t read Alice’s psychology, I could read the Paladin’s psychology
who were receiving her orders.

In other words, this meant that I would indirectly infer Alice’s plans
and orders. Which was convenient.

“Everyone, quiet.”

The students turned to face Professor Daisy with smiles on their faces.
They were quiet, but they couldn’t hide their delight.

“Although the decision was delayed, I believe that three weeks is enough
to prepare for the Grand Festival. Now, we will start recruiting
participants for each event. Since every student must participate in at
least one event, don’t hesitate to apply for the event you’re interested
in.”

She was talking about recruiting participants for the sports event.

Professor Daisy wrote the information on the board.

The chalk, imbued with magic, carved letters on the board in colors that
she chose, and when she infused magic on parts she wanted to emphasize,
it shimmered for emphasis.

Watching that scene, I thought about the Clover Paladin’s plan.

‘It’s so childish.’

He saw my anger when White was beaten by the Priestess. The Clover
Paladin used that element to plot his selfish scheme.

The list of participants for each event would be made public to everyone
at the academy during the Grand Festival. The Student Council President
could check that information in advance.

The Four Paladins would be given that information beforehand in their
quest to find the Black Monster.

With that, the Clover Paladin would confirm which event White would
participate in and lure another student in the same event into an
accident.

Then, he intended to take that student’s place in the event. The reason
he’d built up a good image with the students was to take advantage of
such situations.

‘Since he got hurt, I will participate instead.’ Imagine a tall,
athletic, handsome, and sociable alpha male making such a touching
statement.

The students, especially the girls, would be supporting him with tears
of joy.

And he had every intention of hurting White during the Grand Festival.

Since it was a sport, I could only watch in silence if White got hurt.
That was how the Clover Paladin wanted me to build up my anger.

‘After all, the Grand Festival sports mainly involve participants
clashing with each other.’

For example, sports like soccer, ice hockey, or rugby. Not that such
sports were actually played, but it implied that physical confrontations
were inevitable.

In the end, on the last day of the Grand Festival, the Clover Paladin
planned to secretly convey to me that ‘I intentionally hurt White’,
aiming to direct my anger towards him.

He must have thought that would lead to a real fight between us.

‘Idiot.’

***Will I let his childish intentions come to pass? Obviously not. I
have no intention of letting White get hurt again.***

I decided to use that opportunity to my advantage.

\*\*\*

Upon reaching the corner of the Butterfly Garden, I saw a goddess
sitting leisurely against a zelkova tree out in the sun.

She tipped her witch’s hat and smiled brightly at me. Her halo was
dazzling.

“Oh, President!”

“Senior!”

Dorothy jumped up to greet me.

She was so pretty. I scurried over to her.

“Did you have lunch yet? You’re here early.”

“I just had a quick bite! President, what event did you choose for the
Grand Festival?”

“The arc ball race.”

“Me too! We’re in sync!”

Dorothy showed her pearly white teeth and let out her signature laugh,
‘nihihi.’

‘Arc ball race.’

It was a race to chase a shiny ball called an ‘arc ball.’ It was called
the Flower of Jeblem, so it was the most popular and large-scale event.

Well, it was called a race, but it was practically a battle for
possession.

Originally, I would have participated in a simple event and waited until
the shadow demon appeared, but because of the Clover Paladin, I
deliberately chose to participate in the arc ball race.

The last time I spoke to White, she said that she would participate in
the arc ball race if the Grand Festival proceeded normally.

When I bumped into White at Orphin Hall earlier, I asked her and she
confirmed that she was participating as planned.

***Well, who would dare stop a princess from joining the arc ball
race?***

Of course, due to the limitation on the number of participants, we had
to select dropouts through a simple bet among the participants. Thanks
to my \[Psychological Insight\], I easily won the bet.

It was a dirty trick, but I was sure the participants would be convinced
if they heard that it was ‘to protect the Princess.’

By the way, because Classes B and C had many students, they were divided
into groups. Tristan ended up in our group, and he was absolutely livid
that he couldn’t fight me.

“That’s how much you wanted to play with me, President?”

Dorothy tilted her head and asked playfully.

A joke deserved a joke as a response.

“Speaking of which, aren’t you too fond of me, Senior? Even copying my
event.”

“Nehehe, what are you talking about? I’ve always been independent.”

“Well, I can’t imagine you without me. How would you survive in this
harsh world without me?”

“I’d be just fine. As long as I have chicken, I’m fine!”

“That’s reassuring.”

I responded with a joke and walked toward the center of the Butterfly
Garden. I couldn’t keep playing around with Dorothy.

“…Hey, President.”

Dorothy spoke as if she remembered something, and I stopped and turned
to look at her.

“You know I’m kidding, right?”

“…?”

She still had her naturally graceful smile, but somehow, there was a
hint of seriousness in her cheerful voice.

‘I was just kidding…’

***What’s with her reaction?***

Of course, I knew. To Dorothy, I was someone of importance in my own
way.

Perhaps that was why Dorothy didn’t want to imagine a world without me,
even as a joke.

“…Senior, you did want to be with me, didn’t you? That’s cute.”

“Nihihi. You’re so cheeky, President!”

It immediately lightened the mood.

Dorothy and I looked at each other and laughed heartily.

\*\*\*

Orphin Hall. Magic Department Class A for first years.

As the sun was setting.

Priestess Miya sat alone in the empty classroom, quietly looking out the
window. The academy grounds were filled with students after hours, each
doing their own thing.

Miya twisted her braided hair, trying to organize her thoughts.

In this academy, she couldn’t always be on top. That fact was
infuriating her.

Luce Eltania. How could she win her over? She seemed utterly indifferent
to wealth and honor. She was completely different from the people that
Miya was familiar with.

Isaac. How could she been bested by that bastard? He was just a lowly
commoner with no credibility. But he did not show fear, as if he didn’t
care whether or not Horan was targeting him.

“…Ugh.”

Suddenly, Miya grabbed a fistful of her hair.

***Isaac. Issac. What the hell is that man?***

Why did she have to come all the way here, why did she have to react so
sensitively over a lowly commoner?

It was his fault. The root of her deep-seated emotions was because of
that person.

Anger flashed in Miya’s eyes. Her veins were throbbing on her forehead.

She wanted to punish Isaac harshly and make him pay for infuriating her
to this extent.

But she couldn’t.

It was obvious she couldn’t just go and punish him at any time. If she
were to get expelled, all the thrilling opportunities for love,
recruiting talents, and everything else Miya wanted would vanish into
thin air.

So, at this moment, Miya secretly harbored thoughts of brutally tearing
Isaac apart.

It was then that a knock on the door resounded.

Startled, Miya quickly turned to the door. The act of knocking in a
classroom, as if it were a private room, disrupted Miya’s thoughts.

Soon, Miya found the answer. The person who knocked must have known that
Miya was alone and wanted to come in.

***Which cocky bastard is it?***

Miya was on guard.

The door opened slowly. Miya’s eyes widened as soon as she saw the
female student who entered.

Her golden hair shone brightly in the sunset streaming through the
window. She was beautiful and enchanting.

Miya swallowed a gasp, recalling the memories from the duel evaluation.

“Hello?”

Alice Carroll greeted her with a gentle smile.

Chapter 178: Preparations for the Grand Festival (2)
====================================================

**༺ Preparations for the Grand Festival (2) ༻**

“Let’s start the meeting of Class B Group C for the Grand Festival!”

In a small meeting room in Orphin Hall of the Magic Department.

Several students, including myself, were seated. It was the group that I
belonged to.

In front was Tristan Humphrey, his back to the board, a confident smile
on his face. His curious voice called the meeting to order.

“First, let’s vote for a group leader! I’ll be the leader! Do you all
agree?!”

***Vote, my ass.***

“Hey, I want to be the leader too…”

“It’s me.”

“Yeah…! T-that’s right…!”

“It’s unanimous, I will be the leader!”

***So incredibly unreasonable.***

I didn’t care who the group leader was, so I kept quiet.

The meeting consisted of discussions about what we would name the group,
how to prepare, and what strategies to use in our respective events.

As Tristan, the group leader, had a strong desire to win, the meeting
was conducted with enthusiasm.

Well, it was the same for everyone. It was a pretty fun atmosphere, and
I found myself getting excited too.

Damn group assignment aside, this meeting was held for everyone to enjoy
the Grand Festival.

\*\*\*

The school was lively. Everyone was preparing for the Grand Festival.

It was not just a sports event, it was a grand festival held once every
three years. The place was buzzing with a festive atmosphere.

Students hung decorations and structures in classrooms and other places.

Thanks to this, Märchen Academy was more imposing than usual.

Due to the terrifying events that had occurred throughout the year, the
students seemed determined to enjoy the festival to the fullest.

The despair, fear, and trauma they felt when confronted with demons like
the Floating Island. This festival was meant to dispel such emotions.

Students from the Magic Department filled the front of Orphin Hall.

Since I didn’t want to stand around and do nothing, I took on tasks that
would help me train my mana mastery. It involved infusing and
manipulating mana into magic tools to be used as shiny ornaments.

It was menial labor that required minimal mana consumption and
repetition. However, since you had to twist mana inside the magic tool,
it would be a difficult task if you had low mana mastery.

Tristan was enthusiastic about his work. Soon, he took on a supervisory
role, and now he was going around offering praises to the students like
“Ha! How aesthetic! Excellent!”

Seeing students genuinely say, “Thank you!” made him burst out laughing.

Each decoration prepared for the academy was filled with the student’s
hard work and dedication. Knowing this, Tristan walked around showering
praises with an excited voice.

Mateo Jordana was quietly focused on the preparations for the Grand
Festival.

Amy Holloway was busy making and moving decorations while flirting with
the main character, Ian Fairytale.

Kaya Astrea was in charge of moving big and heavy decorations using her
wind magic. The students gasped and applauded at her ridiculously high
mana density and Kaya responded with a shy, yet proud smile.

Suddenly, Kaya looked in my direction and our eyes met. I smirked and
gave her a thumbs-up.

***What a remarkable girl.***

Kaya’s face turned bright red. With newfound motivation, she
effortlessly lifted even heavier decorations to the top of the building.

Even I couldn’t help but think that her mana density and mastery were
insane when she placed the decorations at the top of the spire with her
wind.

***Ah, the task is finished. There aren’t many magic tools left to work
on here.***

“Group leader, I’m done with this!”

After infusing all the magic tools with mana, I shouted at Tristan.

He quickly approached and inspected the magic tools lined up in front of
me, frowning.

“Damn it… There’s nothing to criticize…!”

He seemed to have been hoping to find some fault.

“I’m going inside to handle the rest.”

“Then, go to the utility room on the third floor. I’m sure you can be of
help there.”

“I knew it\~. You know everything. You’re our pride, Tristan.”

“Tch…! Don’t act friendly with me, Isaac!”

Tristan frowned and grimaced when I chuckled softly.

Then, following Tristan’s instructions, I went inside Orphin Hall and
went up to the third floor.

Utility room. I peeked through the window and saw a feast of
decorations. The students were happily chattering away, busy preparing
for the festival.

They greeted me warmly, shouting, “Isaac!” when I entered the room.

“Where are the magic tools?”

“Over there! Isaac can work on those!”

A female student in Class B pointed toward a large pile of small magic
tools. This would take some time.

The blackout curtains occupying a corner of the utility room were drawn
back. All eyes turned in that direction.

“Ta-da! The face of the second-years appears!”

“Waaah!”

“Oh, so pretty!”

What appeared were three girls sweating profusely, trying to maintain
their excitement, and Luce Eltania with a nonchalant expression.

The students on the opposite side of the curtain cheered, admiring
Luce’s beauty.

***Seriously, she’s amazing.***

Luce was dressed in a modified wizard’s robe that accentuated her
figure. She was so dazzlingly beautiful that eyes were naturally drawn
toward her.

Seeing her in person, she was quite sensual.

The male students blushed and stared at Luce, completely mesmerized.

Her makeup enhanced her beauty even more, so I totally understood their
feelings.

On the other hand, the three girls standing around Luce looked terrified
for some reason. Their forced smiles were very obvious.

‘What happened behind the curtain…’

They looked like they were walking on thin ice…

Luce’s current appearance was due to a Grand Festival tradition.

Each department and grade would select the most beautiful person to
represent them. These representatives would boost morale as the face of
their respective grades.

They were automatically entered into one of the festival’s events, the
beauty pageant.

In the Magic Department, Snow White was chosen to represent the
first-years and Dorothy for the third-years. Among other strong
competitors, Priestess Miya and Alice Carroll chose not to participate
due to personal reasons.

Miya was appointed to dance during the Grand Festival, and Alice was the
Student Council President. However, they could have participated in the
pageant if they wanted to.

Ah. If anyone asked why Miya, who followed a different religion, would
be dancing, it was because the Lord, Manhalla, advocates for harmony.

The academy requested the Priestess to dance in hopes that the festival
would be celebrated alongside the God of Horan, and Miya agreed to it.

Also, in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Dorothy was not present at this time
of year, so some pretty student was chosen as the face of the
third-years.

He was a cross-dresser. Surely, many male students who had taken a
liking to him would throw up upon discovering the truth.

***Thank Dorothy that Dorothy is still alive.***

He would appear in the beauty pageant, but my goddess Dorothy, would
crush him with her divine beauty.

“Huh?”

Luce had been standing poutingly, but when she spotted me, her
expression softened into a warm smile. It was a dramatic change of
expression.

“Isaac!”

She ran towards me, the hem of her dress fluttering. Envious gazes of
the male students turned in my direction. However, I was used to it by
now.

“Oh, Luce, aren’t you looking pretty?”

“Hehe, is that so? Do I *really* look that pretty?”

As Luce twirled around, holding the hem of her dress to show off her
appearance, I gave her a thumbs-up and nodded empathically.

Luce swung her body. She seemed pleased with my compliment.

“Be careful not to fall for me, okay?”

Luce smiled cheekily.

***What a tease.***

I smirked and flicked her forehead lightly.

Although she didn’t seem to be in pain, likely due to \[Basic Protection
Magic\] she habitually used, the slight impact made Luce touch her
forehead in surprise.

“I’ll go get working.”

“Ah, me too. I’ll help you.”

“You have your own tasks, Dummy.”

The students seemed hesitant to talk to Luce. Whenever someone other
than me talked to her, her face would stiffen up and her mouth would
shut tight.

Since they were all looking at me pleading for help, I decided to make
it clear to Luce.

“Let’s do our assigned tasks first. Luce, you have the most important
role in our class. We’ll be more motivated if you become more delightful
than anyone.”

“…Hmm.”

“Well, let’s both give it our all.”

In the end, Luce nodded her head, and the students breathed a sigh of
relief.

***Good.***

I lightly patted Luce’s delicate shoulder and walked over to the magic
tools, repeating the work I had been doing outside Orphin Hall. I
infused the magic tools with mana, checked if they were working
properly, and forged them one by one.

Occasionally, Luce would come up behind me and rest her chin on my
shoulder.

It seemed to calm her down just by resting on my back.

“Isaac.”

While I was busy working, a girl came up to me and whispered in my ear.

“Thanks to you, Luce has become docile. Kehe, seriously, thank you…!”

“Oh? Is that so…”

She was on the verge of tears.

***Became docile, huh? What was she like before…?***

After expressing her gratitude, she smiled and walked towards the
blackout curtains. As she entered, the curtains partially opened.

I stretched my head out like a turtle and peeked through the curtains.
Luce was being pampered by the female students, her face was calm like a
docile puppy.

She looked blissful. Just my presence seemed to make Luce happy.

A smirk escaped my lips.

\*\*\*

“Senior Isaac!”

“You’re so handsome…”

“Haa, Senior Isaac…!”

There were not enough magic tools for the number of people. It seemed
there was a mistake in the distribution of the supplies provided by the
academy.

So, I went down to the first-year floor to look for spare magic tools,
and a few female students sent me adoring glances.

I heard from White before that my story was often talked about amongst
the first-years. The way I looked and acted during the duel with the
Priestess hade made an impression on the students.

She said that even disregarding the whole Priestess fiasco, many
students thought I was cool.

Well, it was a pretty good feeling.

It was a senior’s duty to show their juniors how cool they were.

***Let’s keep our cool.***

I walked down the hallway like I always do, back straight and walking
like a model. Today, for some reason, I felt like I was going to fall
over.

“Hey, Buddy, do you have a spare of this?”

I showed the magic tool I was carrying to a female student passing by in
the hallway.

Her face turned red as she replied in a shy voice, “Yes, we do…” and
pointed towards the utility room.

I walked over and opened the door without hesitation.

“…?”

A cute female student was sitting in front of the doorway.

Her pure white hair swirled up like a spike, immediately drawing my
attention.

It was Snow White, the face of the first-year.

Our eyes met.

For a moment, my mind had to take time to process the situation.

I looked around. All the students in the utility room had their hair up
in a spike as if it were a stiletto pointing to the ceiling.

They stopped chattering and quietly looked in my direction. It was as if
they were trying to keep their silence to respect their senior.

The silence was suffocating.

“…”

***…I’ll just buy the magic tools with my own money.***

With that thought, I quietly closed the door and turned away.

I didn’t want to know why they looked like that, nor did I want to
associate with them.

“S-senior Isaac…!”

Although the stiletto-haired junior’s teary plea reached me, wanting to
explain something…

I quickly fled the scene.

Chapter 179: Preparations for the Grand Festival (3)
====================================================

**༺ Preparation for the Grand Festival (3) ༻**

“Presideent\~!”

“Senior Dorothy…? Oh.”

After purchasing magic tools from the store, I was leisurely working
alone on a bench near Orphin Hall. I made a thick table using \[Rock
Generation\] and it made working more convenient.

Suddenly, Dorothy came down from above and approached me. She must have
spotted me while flying around with her starlight mana.

As the face of the third year, she was dressed in a beautifully designed
witch outfit. It must have been made by skilled designers of her grade.
For a moment, I was so mesmerized by her that I lost my train of
thought.

“Do you have any of these left?”

Dorothy showed me an identical magic tool that I was working on.

“Yes, I bought extra, so I have some spare. How many do you need?”

“About 20!”

“…That much?”

“I broke about 20 of them when I was helping the students by infusing
them all at once. I promised to take responsibility and find
replacements!”

Dorothy responded with pride, like breaking it was something to brag
about.

She overestimated this small magic tool. How could they withstand her
mana?

“Did you buy these? Looks like you guys were also short.”

“Yes, we were.”

“Nihihi. I have extra gel, so I’ll buy it from you at double the price!”

Dorothy extended her index and middle fingers.

“I won’t refuse that.”

I accepted in a heartbeat.

She was already a sight to see, and I also got financial benefits.
Dorothy was a godsend.

“Heave-ho\~.”

“Senior?”

Without warning, Dorothy approached the bench and sat down next to me.
No, she laid down, using my thigh as a pillow.

***Huh?***

I felt my face heat up a bit.

Her pretty face was positioned so that I could see it if I tilted my
head slightly. Her eyes, looking up at me with a smile, seemed to hold
the vastness of the universe within them, thanks to her starlight mana.

“Can I borrow your leg for a bit, President?”

“Oh, yes… of course, Senior. But is it okay to do this?”

“I’m tired. I want to slack off.”

It was a mind truly deserving of a perfect score.

The corners of my mouth threatened to dance on their own and I struggled
to keep my composure.

Perhaps sensing my emotions, Dorothy sheepishly opened her eyes and
smirked.

“President, can you not get excited when I’m like this?”

“I can try.”

Startled by her soft voice, I continued working on the table and
responded calmly. As expected, it was impossible to hide my feelings for
Dorothy at my level.

Having Dorothy’s head on my thigh gave me a subtle sexual stimulation.
Especially since she was dressed in an unusual and sensual outfit,
intensifying the feeling.

I figured it would get better if I just focused on my work.

“I’ll get up if you’re uncomfortable\~. I need to leave soon anywa-”

“No.”

I looked down at Dorothy and smiled. Her smile was pretty.

“It’s okay, stay a bit longer.”

“…Oh?”

Dorothy seemed surprised by my reaction, her mouth dropped open.

Then, as if satisfied with my answer, she nodded her head.

“I can’t help it then\~. I’m the not type to refuse kindness.”

She smiled broadly and closed her eyes.

A feeling of happiness washed over me as I gently stroked Dorothy’s
hair. At that moment, Dorothy smiled contentedly and quietly enjoyed my
touch.

A refreshing breeze blew in.

\* \* \*

“Sir Isaac…?”

The female knight with green hair in a ponytail, Merlin Astrea, was
hiding in a nearby tree because she could not enter Orphin Hall. She was
currently surveying the inside along with her familiar.

It was quite a distance away, but she could see the utility room where
White was located. If she found someone suspicious, she could easily
take them down.

…However, she couldn’t understand why they were doing a strange ritual
with strange hairstyles. No, she didn’t want to understand.

As she was watching White.

She saw Isaac working on a bench near Orphin Hall.

There was a stone table in front of him.

Behind him, a girl’s bare legs stretched out from the side of the bench.

Her toes were wiggling in her heels. They twisted and turned, pushing
off her heels and straightening out. Her toes were flushed red,
wriggling furiously.

Her embarrassed feelings were fervently expressed by her toes, but Isaac
didn’t seem to have noticed.

“Hmph.”

*Smirk*. With a smile on her face, Merlin wiped her nose.

Even at a time like this, Isaac and Luce were spending time together.

Whenever Merlin thought about the relationship between those two, she
felt as if she had become a young girl again. The fresh love stories of
youth had the power to touch her heart deeply.

Especially the love life of Isaac, White’s mentor, brought her so much
joy.

***Are those two in that kind of relationship now? Well, if they’re like
that, it says it all.***

‘You’ve found love at last, Sir Isaac.’

Hence, the thought that Isaac and Luce had become lovers brought a sense
of satisfaction to Merlin.

Merlin momentarily commanded her familiar to watch over White while she
observed Isaac with interest.

“…?”

But, something was off.

Merlin’s expression gradually stiffened.

Now that she looked at it, those legs… Were they really Luce Eltania’s?

Due to the distance and the wiggling toes, she hadn’t noticed it at the
start, but they seemed to belong to someone slightly taller than Luce.

“Hmm.”

Well, it must be a misunderstanding. Who else could Isaac be engaging in
such intimate behaviors with, other than Luce?

After all, Isaac was the kind of man who could only love one woman. She
had no proof, but Merlin was convinced of that.

She had watched him teach White all this time. It was natural for her to
assume that he was of good and noble character.

However, certainty was always personal.

Soon, Merlin’s fantasy was shattered.

A female student with light purple hair suddenly sprung up from Isaac’s
legs. She looked like she was about to leave.

Merlin’s eyes widened in surprise. At first, she was surprised when she
realized that it wasn’t Luce, and secondly, she was taken aback by the
girl’s identity.

The Star Witch, Dorothy Heartnova. A formidable figure in the continent.
A rare genius rumored to have received the blessings of the Lord
Manhalla.

***Such a person, why…?***

“…!”

Dorothy’s gaze snapped towards Merlin.

Merlin locked eyes with her and she quickly ducked to hide herself among
the branches and leaves.

Cold sweat trickled down from her forehead.

***Did she see me? It was likely. That student is not someone this
academy can handle.***

However, there seemed to be no hostility. Dorothy merely seemed to be
protesting with her gaze, asking why Merlin was watching them.

‘Sir Isaac, what in the world…?’

Merlin couldn’t understand the situation.

***Isaac, whom she thought had a noble character, is actually playing
with the hearts of two maidens…?***

And those two were Luce Eltania, the top seat of the second year, and
Dorothy Heartnova, the top seat of the third year…?

‘It can’t be…’

How could she accept this? The fact that Isaac had two women was one
thing, but the fact that they were two of the most talented and powerful
women on the continent was another.

If those proud women both liked one man…

***Won’t it be a bloodbath far beyond the means of this academy?***

Merlin thought there must be some misunderstanding.

But it wasn’t something she could directly ask…!

Merlin, who had supported the warm love story of Isaac and Luce,
desperately tried to erase the feeling of betrayal that was slowly
creeping up in her.

\* \* \*

“Tristan, we’re done over here!”

“Ha! What’s this modded? It’s splendid!”

“Tristan, take a look at this! It might not be well-made, but I did my
best…!”

“Ha! Are your eyes just for decoration? How pathetic! It’s utterly
beautiful!”

“Tristan, how about this? Isn’t it perfect?”

“Don’t talk about ‘perfection’ rashly! The angle isn’t perfect!”

The sun was slowly setting.

After I finished working on the magic tools, I helped move heavy items
and decorations. Unexpectedly, I found it beneficial for muscle training
and stamina, I sprinted as I carried the items, and the students watched
me in amazement.

I looked around Orphin Hall as I ran.

The vain blond nobleman, Tristan Humphrey, had completely become the
manager of the second-year’s festival preparations for the Magic
Department. His tone seemed like he was pouring out criticisms, but if
you listened closely, it was mostly compliments.

Looking around, the scene was quite different from the familiar scene of
Märchen Academy.

The colorful banners flying overhead glowed with magical light, and
ornate decorations surrounded the buildings for aesthetic appeal.
Colorful strings connected between buildings. Various lights and
uniquely designed lamps beautifully illuminated the structures.

Although I had seen this countless times in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I
still couldn’t help but be impressed.

I wondered how beautiful it would be on the day of the Grand Festival.
It looked like it would be much more impressive than I imagined.

Now, I would be decorating the academy in my spare time.

Next would be practicing for each event, like cheering, etc. I should
also start practicing for the arc ball race.

I had three main goals during the Grand Festival.

First, protect White.

Second, defeat the Clover Paladin.

And third…

‘Clear Chapter 8 safely.’

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, I gained EXP no matter which event I
participated in, but I wasn’t sure if that would be the case here.

Based on my past experiences, it seemed likely that I would gain EXP.

‘Besides, I’ll be clashing with that Clover bastard in the arc ball
race.’

It would be a shame if I didn’t get any EXP.

Moreover, Märchen Academy offered many gifts at the Grand Festival.
Significant achievements could lead to quite substantial rewards.

‘I’ll have to give it my all.’

It was like any other day.

I faced obstacles and overcame them.

\* \* \*

On the rooftop of Orphin Hall, Priestess Miya was quietly gazing at the
sky dyed with the evening sunset.

She had helped with the preparations for the first year Grand Festival,
aware of her status as a student.

“…”

A week ago, around this time.

Sitting in an empty classroom, she heard the whisper of the Student
Council President, Alice Carroll.

Every time her enchanting lips moved, Miya felt her mind drift away.

—’You hate your senior, Isaac, do you not?’

—’You hate people, do you not?’

Miya felt herself falling into a hypnotic trance as she listened to
Alice’s voice.

—’It’s okay, you don’t have to hide your feelings.’

From within the choker. A thin stream of dark mana emanating from
Alice’s neck quietly flowed into Miya.

And, Alice’s voice gnawed at Miya’s mind like a mouse.

—’I only stopped you back then because we couldn’t have innocent
victims.’

–’So, my dear, how about you express your feelings to the person you
hate, at just the right moment?’

─‘Why not pour out all your emotions right now, without restraint?’

─‘Surely, you’ll feel better.’

Malice grew within Miya’s mind. As she felt her heart slowly being
overtaken, she felt alarmed but couldn’t break free from Alice.

It was as if her entire body was tightly chained. She couldn’t move an
inch.

With a trembling voice, Miya asked why she was saying those things to
her.

And with a comforting smile and tender voice, Alice whispered.

─‘Because I know you are a superior being’

─‘Someone too special to be ignored.’

─‘That’s who you are.’

Miya’s eyes lost their light, and they scanned the academy grounds.

The silver-blue-haired second year, Isaac, caught her eye as he mingled
among the students.

For a while, Miya watched him with a cold gaze, then turned her back and
walked away.

<span id="0178_180_The_Grand_Festival_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 180: The Grand Festival (1)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (1) ༻**

“Now, I declare the commencement of Märchen Academy’s Jeblem!!”

Headmistress Elena Woodline’s cheerful proclamation echoed loudly
throughout the vibrantly decorated Märchen Academy. Her voice was
amplified by the loudspeakers placed throughout.

Simultaneously, bundles of magical fireworks burst into the daylight
sky.

With a loud boom, the Academy erupted in cheers as students filled the
outdoor stadium. The atmosphere was particularly loud.

It was a fine day.

The weather was sunny, and the temperature was just right.

On stage, a choir and cheer squad, dressed in beautiful outfits, sang
and danced to the excitement.

After many incidents dampened the mood, the academy was in full swing
for the first time in a long time.

“Ohhh.”

From the back seat, Luce Eltania rested her chin on the crown of my head
and watched the performance with me, impressed.

I felt the same. Watching a performance filled with the unique
sentiments of this world in real life was so different from what I’d
seen in the game. It was deeply moving and struck a chord in my heart.

Märchen Academy planned to create a joyful atmosphere at the opening
ceremony and a touching one at the closing ceremony a few days later.

Priestess Miya would dance in hopes that the gods would come together
and enjoy the Grand Festival, and at the same time bestow abundance.

The dance was meant to symbolize a peaceful world filled with love.
However, considering the prejudiced value of the dancer, it was
regrettable that the meaning of the dance was diminished.

That reminded me…

***…Isn’t it time for Luce to go?***

“Luce, when are you going to get ready?”

“Soon. I’ll be right back, so stay here.”

“What are you talking about? You can’t come back, you’re the second
year’s representative.”

“What does that have to do anything? I’ll stay by your side.”

Luce responded calmly and confidently with her beautiful voice.

I guess she would never change. A stubborn character who would ignore
the rules if they didn’t suit her. She was like Dorothy in a way.

Normally, one would want to be with their one and only friend in such an
event. Well, that had always been the case, but it was inevitable this
time.

“Don’t be so stubborn… or I’ll avoid you.”

“…I suddenly hate the Grand Festival.”

Luce grumbled as she twirled my tousled hair with her fingers.

During the opening ceremony, a girl approached Luce and spoke to her.
She was in charge of the second-years makeup.

“Luce, let’s go and get you ready.”

“Ugh…”

She looked incredibly disgusted…. and her expression was hilarious.

“Bye.”

As I chuckled, Luce grabbed my shoulders with a sullen face, seemingly
annoyed with me, and brought her mouth to my ear.

“I hate you.”

She whispered and blew a breath into my ear. It sent shivers down my
spine and I felt a rush of thrilling pleasure.

Wow. I reflexively pulled my head back and covered my ear.

‘That… was very stimulating.’

Luce exploited the fact that her voice was a weak spot for my ears
whenever she found me annoying. She did so without warning and was
incredibly proficient at it.

Luce glared at me with a displeased expression and got up from her seat.
It was her way of showing displeasure for how quickly I could send her
off.

Of course, it was mostly a joke. Luce was not irresponsible enough to
abandon her role.

“Sorry, Isaac. I’ll need to borrow Luce for a bit\~.”

The girl apologized with an awkward smile and left the stands with Luce.
I waved goodbye to Luce, saying we’d see each other later.

I was alone again. Holding a magic tool, I pretended to watch the
students while repeatedly circulating mana and quietly scanning my
surroundings.

The four Paladins sat separately amidst the first-years of the Magic
Department.

Alice Carroll was seated on the upper deck, away from the stands, as the
Student Council President.

I discreetly paid attention to them.

\*\*\*

The Grand Festival proceeded just as I had seen in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱.

Before the games began, the students cheered as the faces of each
representative made their entrance.

They ignored the representatives from other departments.

From the Magic Department, White for the first year, Luce for the second
year, and Dorothy for the third year took the stage. They were dressed
in beautifully modified clothes and wore make-up that highlighted their
prominent beauty.

White was nervous, Luce was indifferent, and Dorothy was excited. They
all boasted their exceptional appearances, fitting their role as the
face of their respective year.

It was a huge relief that White was properly dressed and didn’t have her
stiletto-shaped hair.

After they were placed in their respective seats, various games took
place. The students cheered for their side with various performances
centered around their representatives.

Being in a festive atmosphere inevitably brought joy. I resisted.
Whenever the urge to enjoy myself rose, I suppressed it and kept my
emotions in check.

‘Don’t break the tension.’

There was no telling what the Clover Paladin would do to White.

It was now lunchtime. The heat of the game had died down and the
students were eager to get something to eat.

With a face full of dissatisfaction, Luce was dragged away by the
students to prepare for the next performance.

My heart sank at the thought of her being separated from the students
and eating alone, but regretfully, I wouldn’t be able to join her today.
All because of the Clover Paladin.

“Nyahaha! Karina, I almost died laughing earlier! Your slapstick\~.
Nihihi!”

“Ugh. Dorothy, you…”

The popular Dorothy was swarmed by students and they all went for lunch.
Their laughter never stopped.

I suddenly remembered watching the opening ceremony for the Grand
Festival in ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱.

Before the ceremony began, a cleric from the Helize Church offered a
prayer of thanks. Whenever this happened, I hoped that the festival’s
warmth would reach Dorothy as well, asking her to watch over this scene
from heaven, which she had given her life to protect.

‘Because in such a scenario, Dorothy had to die.’

I couldn’t help but smile.

Seeing Dorothy enjoying life at the academy like it was the most natural
thing filled me with a sense of pride.

‘Well, now…’

***Let’s get to work.***

My goal for the Grand Festival was to protect White. Every time I
remembered how badly beaten she was by Priestess Miya, anger surged
within me.

The Clover Paladin also harbored a childish plan to harm White to
provoke me.

Since \[Psychological Insight\] was not all-powerful, I couldn’t
precisely know how he might have changed his mind by now. He might have
found a way to torment White in a way I couldn’t anticipate.

In that case.

“Excuse me, I need to get through.”

I made my way through the first-years of the Magic Department.

I approached the Pure White Princess who stood at the top of the class,
bent over, looking down at the students like a goddess.

“Hey?”

“Huh? Senior Isaac?”

“Ack!”

Ignoring the various reactions of the freshmen as they stepped aside, I
noticed the four Paladins had already left and were nowhere to be seen.

The students flocked around White like she was a celebrity. She had yet
to notice that I was approaching.

She was smiling awkwardly, looking quite troubled.

She seemed to be unable to escape the crowd of students. I could tell
she was anxious to get down from her seat and get away.

“Please grant us the honor of serving Princess White…!”

“There’s no beauty in the world that can compare to White’s beauty!”

“Your Highness! I, the eldest child of the Hameln Family, will serve you
with utmost dedication!”

What a commotion. If I were that popular, my self-esteem would be
through the roof.

Well, if it were any other Princess, who had heard all sorts of
flattery, they might’ve been annoyed by this utterly chaotic atmosphere
and ordered everyone to shut up.

It would have been quiet, as if a mouse had died. But the good-natured
White was incapable of doing anything even remotely similar.

Despite holding the power and status of an Imperial Princess.

The students took White lightly, confident that she wouldn’t retaliate.
It was the fate of a kind-hearted pushover.

Of course, I couldn’t say that I didn’t get them. They were the children
of noble families, after all, eager to make a good impression on White.

Especially here, in an academy where traditional social hierarchies were
somewhat lax.

Being of the same age as the Princess, the chance to interact with her
so closely would likely never come again.

However, regrettably, I must take that opportunity away.

“Huh?”

White spotted me. Surprise spread across her face, turning into relief.

The first-years were also surprised at my sudden arrival.

***Yes, be surprised. I am your senior, Isaac, the one you all
admire.***

“White.”

The previously noisy atmosphere quieted down significantly because of
me.

I stood in front of White and looked up at her.

And she looked down from her high seat, meeting my gaze.

“Let’s go.”

When I held out my right hand, White’s head faintly trembled. Her eyes
widened even more, and her lips parted slightly, looking stunned.

Perhaps because she had been wanting to escape from the crowd of
students, my hand must have felt like a lifeline.

Although our relationship began as mentor and mentee, White now regarded
me as a teacher and master. That made me more approachable to her than
anyone else at the Academy.

Well, the feeling was mutual. Initially, I wasn’t too excited about
meeting White, but as we spent time together, a deep affection
developed.

It felt similar to the sentiment in old movies where a master would
cherish their student. Was it something like that…? I wasn’t too sure.

Anyway, had that cleared up the traffic?

“…Okay.”

A pure smile flooded over White’s face.

Without hesitation, she grabbed my hand and jumped off her seat.

*Whoosh*

A cushion of wind magic fluttered beneath her feet.

White landed smoothly on the ground, and we exchanged bright smiles.

The freshmen were astounded, especially those nearby who had been
showering White with their flatteries.

They were armed with high status, all sorts of flattery, adulation, and
sweet nothings to invite White for a meal.

It must have been quite perplexing for them to see White go because I, a
commoner, simply said ‘Let’s go.’

“Ack.

I took White with me.

We had to cut through a sea of first-years, so I held onto White’s wrist
and walked away. It would be troublesome if I lost her in the crowd.

Fortunately, most of them made way for us. They were most likely aware
of our mentor-mentee relationship.

Having her wrist grabbed, White let out a tiny yelp that soon turned to
silence. The explanation could wait until later.

As long as Alice didn’t reveal her true intentions, I had to be cautious
about the Clover Paladin, the alpha male who was targeting White to
provoke me.

My solution was simple. I just had to keep White by my side.

Right now, the Hilde was hiding in the collar of my shirt, keeping
watch.

Unless it was an all-out brawl, I would be able to go toe-to-toe with
the Clover Paladin.

I was determined to protect White. I couldn’t allow a repeat of what
happened during the duel evaluation.

I turned my head back to look at White as we continued walking.

She pursed her lips, trying hard to keep her delight from showing on her
face.

She looked hilarious and I couldn’t help but let out a chuckle.

“Keep up with me. I won’t let go of your hand.”

“…Yes…!”

White nodded and gazed at me intently. Her delight had a hint of
nervousness.

What was it? The scene unfolding before White seemed to be making a deep
impression on her.

Well, there was no point in reading her psychology.

I turned my head back to the front and we quickened our pace.

As we passed the still-stunned first-years, we made our way out of the
stadium.

“Ah, Merlin.”

I spotted Merlin Astrea at the entrance and greeted her with a bright
smile, pleased to see her.

Being an outsider, she wasn’t allowed inside, so she had been watching
over White from that spot. Interestingly, as the daughter of the Sword
Saint, she was more than capable of protecting White from this distance.

As we approached the exit, I invited Merlin to a meal. Having her around
would certainly feel reassuring.

“How about joining us for a meal…”

*Swoosh.*

With a graceful move, Merlin quickly positioned herself between White
and me, placing her hand on White’s grasped wrist.

White and I stopped dead in our tracks.

“Sir Isaac.”

“Yes…?”

“Please let go of Princess White’s hand.”

Merlin shot me with a wary glance.

<span id="0179_181_The_Grand_Festival_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 181: The Grand Festival (2)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (2) ༻**

The Astrea Family was currently formed through the union of the Sword
Saint Gerald and the genius wizard Historia.

However, their story did not start with a beautiful tale of pure love.
Rather, it was a story of a grotesque, struggle of lust, desire, and war
to determine which woman would claim Gerald as her own.

Gerald Astrea, the head of the Astrea Family, was once a notorious
womanizer. A man of status and fame who always had a woman by his side,
a true casanova.

Historia was one of the women who loved Gerald, and she somehow managed
to capture his heart and drive the other women away.

Yet, it did not change Gerald’s past or his lascivious nature, which
coveted every beautiful woman he laid his eyes upon.

Merlin Astrea despised her father for it.

Considering his status, it wouldn’t have been unusual for him to have
several concubines, but Merlin could never forgive him for being
physically involved with other women while still married to her mother.

Moreover, Historia only seemed to have resigned herself to the situation
and told her husband to exercise self-restraint. To Merlin, it was
frustrating that her mother simply gave up and let things slide solely
because she was the legitimate wife.

Therefore, Merlin longed for a love that was pure and beautiful, like a
flower, not one that was mired in lust like mud.

However, as she focused solely on her swordsmanship, graduated from the
academy, and joined the Imperial Knights, hearing lustful conversations
of men made her idealistic hopes for pure love seem more like a distant
dream.

***Is it that hard to find true love?***

Having never had romantic feelings for anyone even after becoming a
knight, the concept of pure love became something Merlin could only
yearn for.

That was why Isaac and Luce’s relationship at the academy, full of
youthful innocence, seemed so beautiful to Merlin.

She believed they embodied the pure love she had dreamed had only ever
dreamed of.

Moreover, Merlin was secretly happy that such a person was White’s
mentor.

However.

‘Why would you show such a sight, Sir Isaac…’

After seeing Isaac and Dorothy spend time together like young lovers
during the Grand Festival preparations, Merlin wished to deny reality.

In the end, was Isaac no different from her despicable father, Gerald
Astrea, a man who hid his lascivious nature behind a kind facade…?

…No, that was a rude thought. There could be misunderstandings Merlin
hadn’t been made aware of. Yet, she couldn’t help but be wary.

Isaac was a good-looking man with a gentle personality. It wasn’t
surprising that Snow White, who was a teenager and didn’t care about
social status, might have a crush on him.

That was why Merlin was secretly wary of Isaac.

Even though their relationship was limited to teaching the basics of
scythe combat and swordsmanship, she had grown fond of him during the
time they spent together.

Whether or not Isaac was attracted to women was a separate issue.

\* \* \*

Merlin’s chilly demeanor was understandable.

No matter how close White and I were, the extreme difference in our
social statuses couldn’t be ignored, and the act of leading her by the
wrist was problematic in and of itself.

Even if I was an escort knight, I would have been cautious of someone
like me.

I did it only because I trusted White, but if it had been any other
Princesses, by now we would be deeply discussing whether or not to cut
off my wrist. The situation could have escalated uncontrollably.

And…

‘She saw it.’

Merlin thought that Luce and I were in an intimate kind of relationship.

After accidentally seeing me with Dorothy during the Grand Festival
preparations, she seemed confused. I could tell by reading her
psychology.

She thought I was possibly a womanizer and was wary of my physical
contact with White.

I wasn’t too affected. It was nothing new.

I felt boundless affection for my favorite characters.

What Merlin thought of my actions of showering them with affection
hardly mattered.

“…I’m sorry, White.”

White let out a muffled ‘Ah,’ when I let go of her hand.

However, Merlin continued to glare at me. She was so wary.

White was flustered by the unexpected tense atmosphere. She forced a
smile and waved her hands quickly enough to leave an afterimage.

“N-no! Don’t be sorry! I was so happy that Isaac brought me here! Also,
um, Merlin…?”

Merlin had no intention of making White uncomfortable. She reluctantly
bowed her head once and stood next to White.

Without another word, we all walked out of the stadium.

White seemed flustered by the subdued atmosphere.

Even after lunch, Merlin Astrea kept a close watch on me.

Whenever I tried to make even the slightest bit of physical contact with
White, she would intervene and stop me.

Not knowing what sweet words might pop out, I also paid attention to my
words and actions.

‘This is getting uncomfortable.’

At least now her wariness had died down. Perhaps it was because
passersby were admiring White’s beauty, and she was internally growling
at them as ‘a bunch of horny people.’

Today, White’s beauty was even more radiant than usual as she was fully
dressed up as the face of the first year of the Magic Department.

“Princess White, your dress…”

“Ack?!”

Suddenly, the sound of fabric tearing resounded from behind White.

It seemed that even with her slender body, the tautly pulled fabric
couldn’t take it anymore.

“Ahhh…!”

White scrambled to her feet, trying to look at her back.

Merlin took out a thin coat from her magic pouch and draped it over
White’s shoulders.

“Ah, thank you, Merlin! Senior Isaac, do you mind if we go to the
dressing room?!”

“Let’s go.”

We made our way to Orphin Hall.

As soon as we entered, we noticed the graduate student, Marco, hunched
over and trudging along. The dark circles under his eyes suggested he
had been up for several nights.

I wondered why he was so busy even though it was time for the Grand
Festival. It was regrettable, but it was unavoidable since he was a
graduate student. We passed by him.

White, Merlin, and I went up to the first-year floor and entered the
dressing room, a space prepared for use during the Grand Festival.

“The spare clothes…. are here. Merlin, could you help me get dressed?”

“Sure.”

White took a set of clothes hanging on the rack and went behind the
blackout curtains with Merlin.

White stuck her head out and looked at me.

“These clothes are difficult to put on by myself… Senior Isaac, I’m
sorry, but could you wait a bit?”

I nodded and leaned against the wall. While I waited, I decided to
concentrate on circulating mana in my magic tool.

Sounds of fabric brushing against skin came from behind the curtain.
White groaning ‘ugh,’ indicated that the pretty clothes were difficult
to take off. It seemed even Merlin was struggling to help her change.

It was going to take some time.

“By the way, Senior Isaac. Uhm…”

Just then, White spoke from beyond the curtain.

Like it was the right moment to bring up a conversation that would be
difficult to have face-to-face. It was clear what she was about to
discuss.

“It’s due tomorrow.”

“Ah, ehehe…! R-right? It’s tomorrow? Of course, I remembered!”

I beat her to it. White had been concerned about it all along, her
excited voice came through.

The due date of the debt overlapped with the Grand Festival. White had
only earned enough gel to get by and had not yet paid off her debt. It
was also unlikely she’d be able to fully repay it by tomorrow.

Even if she did well during the Grand Festival and won a prize, the due
date of her debt would come first before the end of the festival. And
she knew what would happen if she failed to repay the debt.

To White, I was a resolute person. While usually kind and gentle, I
could also seem cold-blooded, capable of cutting ties easily, even
though I didn’t see myself that way at all.

“What are you going to do?”

“I-I can pay it back! I’ll definitely pay it back tomorrow!”

“How?”

I already knew she was thinking of taking a loan from the Academy Bank.

White was still a low-ranked student. In other words, she could only
choose a high-interest loan at the unreasonable Academy Bank. She
wouldn’t be able to manage the skyrocketing interest.

Excessive debt was a shortcut to expulsion, especially for a low-ranked
student like White. Debt adjustment? Holding on? Such things would not
even be considered.

Even though there was a possibility that she would be given special
treatment for being a Princess, it was doubtful that White, who hated
being indebted, would readily accept it.

I was about to suggest that she sell some of her valuable training
tools, but I stopped. Doing so would blur White’s resolution to become
stronger, even if it meant becoming a debtor.

“Anyway! I just wanted to say don’t worry, I can pay it back. I have a
way!”

She was basically saying ‘Don’t prepare your heart to leave my side.’

Since she was absolutely terrified to see someone abandon her.

She was so pure. I somehow felt guilty.

I only mentioned the due date because I wanted White to do her best. Of
course, I’d be by her side, and I had to anyway, considering what was to
come.

“Don’t borrow gel from somewhere else. You won’t be able to handle it.”

“Oh…! T-that can’t be! You’re talking nonsense, I wasn’t thinking about
digging myself into debt…?! How could a low-ranked student like me get a
high-interest loan from the Academy Bank?!”

***I didn’t even mention the loan, you fool.***

Now that the due date was near, it might be okay to talk honestly. I had
no intention of leaving, and I didn’t care whether she paid it off or
not.

Would physical labor be okay? By now, White should have at least reached
the minimum threshold for what I wanted her to do.

I might end up making her do tough tasks like anaerobic exercises, but
she would understand later that it was for the future.

There was no better pretext than ‘paying off the debt.’ There was also a
good purpose for both of us to become stronger together. It was truly a
win-win situation.

After a brief pause, I brought up the conversation.

“You don’t have to pay it back with gel. There are many ways to take
responsibility. If not gel, there’s physical—”

*Swing!*

The curtains flung open, and the escort knight with a green ponytail,
Merlin, popped out.

‘Why did she come out?’

I was flustered. White’s surprised voice came from inside the curtain,
‘Merlin?!’ But Merlin ignored her and quickly walked towards me.

A chill ran down my spine at her eerie gaze.

***What the hell? She’s terrifying.***

“Merlin, where are you going?! M-my clothes…!”

“Excuse me for a moment. Gran, stay with Princess White. Report to me
immediately if anything happens.”

Merlin grabbed my wrist and dragged me to a corner of the dressing room.
Her brown falcon familiar, Gran, was summoned into the air and flew
beside White, closing the curtains with its beak.

*Thud.*

Merlin then pushed me into a corner and forcefully placed her hand next
to my head against the wall.

“Huuu.”

Merlin exhaled deeply, her head hanging low. She seemed to be having a
hard time, drumming her fingers.

***Should I pretend to be perplexed?***

“Merlin? What’s going on all of a sudden—?”

“Sir Isaac, I also feel very burdened by the debt Princess White owes
you. This must also be a social experience that Princess White must
overcome.

Merlin clicked her tongue with a sorrowful expression.

“But indeed, you are just the same as other males. My suspicions weren’t
wrong. I had developed some affection for you, given you were teaching
Princess White well and even taught her basic weapon skills…”

“What are you talking about…?”

“Don’t feign ignorance…!”

Merlin suddenly lifted her head and was about to shout, but she lowered
her voice quickly.

“Suggesting to pay off her debt with something physical, that’s clearly
something indecent…?!”

She cut off my words to suit her own interpretation.

“Even you cannot tolerate using Princess White’s kindness and sense of
responsibility to satisfy your own selfish desires.”

“Merlin…?” White was still behind the curtain, looking desperately for
her escort knight and calling out

After seeing me with Dorothy during the festival preparations, Merlin’s
perception of me drastically changed. The pure-hearted Isaac in her mind
transformed into a lascivious Isaac. The gap between these two
perceptions couldn’t be wider.

Because of this, Merlin had even considered the possibility that I might
make an indecent proposition if White failed to pay off her debt, and
upon hearing my words, she immediately assumed her suspicions were
correct and confronted me. It was a ridiculous misunderstanding.

I might be a harem lover, but I was certainly not a beast who had been
preying on White’s innocence.

And now, it seemed Merlin hastily jumped to a conclusion and pushed her
misunderstanding onto me, which didn’t sit well with me at all.

I narrowed my eyes and spoke with a sharp tone.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. So, are you going to pay me
back tomorrow?”

“That’s…”

White was determined to take responsibility for her own actions. If
Merlin were to pay it all off, it would be an insult to White’s hard
work and commitment.

Merlin knew that better than anyone. Actually, it was doubtful that
Merlin could pay it back in the first place.

“Merlin, what’s going on there…? I can’t wear this dress by myself…!”

Merlin did not respond despite White’s pleading voice, she just locked
eyes with me.

I observed her reaction, curious how she would respond given her haste
to condemn me based on her misunderstandings. I intended to clear up the
misunderstanding, but I was intrigued.

Merlin avoided my gaze and continued with an exasperated look on her
face.

“…Would it be possible to extend the due date or forgive the debt?”

Hmm, it seemed that she was willing to negotiate in a way that wouldn’t
undermine White’s resolve.

***Oh well.***

“Why should I?”

“I’m an outsider, so I can’t use gel, but… I can, just a little… let you
touch me.”

Merlin knew how attractive she was during her years at the Academy and
the Knight Order. I hadn’t expected her to go this far, though.

***Is she suggesting that she will tolerate me touching her body? She
must think that all men would be tempted by such an offer.***

Merlin hung her head again, trying to hide her flushed face.

To go to such lengths.

“Haa.”

I let out a heavy sigh. Merlin glanced at me with a sharp look in her
eyes.

“I’m not interested in your body, Merlin.”

“What?”

Her gaze turned lethal.

***Ah, I may have misspoken.***

I quickly corrected myself.

“I think there’s been a misunderstanding. I was going to have White help
me with mana circulation. It’s tough but beneficial for both of us, so I
thought of it as a way to settle the debt.”

“What…?”

Merlin looked flustered.

“I never had inappropriate thoughts towards White. I’ve been seeing and
teaching her every day for a while now, and I’ve grown fond of you,
Merlin… I didn’t realize you thought of me that way.”

“S-sir Isaac…?”

“I’m… a little disappointed.”

I deliberately looked down, looking sorrowful, which made Merlin break
out in a cold sweat. She seemed troubled about what to say next, clearly
overwhelmed.

I continued, seizing the momentum.

“And why would you say something like that? Do you think your body
wouldn’t be defiled?”

“N-no, that’s not…”

“Don’t ever bring up anything like that in front of me again. Even if
your role is to protect White with your life, that doesn’t diminish your
worth.”

I lectured her like a teacher instructing a child. Perhaps I’d become
accustomed to this manner of speaking from teaching White.

Merlin, her face filled with shock and confusion, trembled violently.

I gently lowered the arm she had propped against the wall. It swung
limply in the air.

***…Unexpectedly, it seems I have incurred a moral debt.***

Merlin was now feeling obliged to apologize and make amends. This might
be a good time to lighten the mood.

“Okay, Merlin?”

“Yesss….”

Her response was lifeless.

That should be enough. I immediately softened my expression to a gentle
smile.

“Alright. Let’s forget this ever happened. White seems to be in a bind,
you should go check on her.”

“…”

“Merlin?”

“…I’m sorry, Sir Isaac. I don’t know if this is alright, but I’ll give
you the opportunity to slit my throat someday…”

I didn’t see the need for such an opportunity.

I smiled awkwardly and reassured her that it was fine and there was no
need for such harsh reflection. Merlin let out a sad sigh.

Merlin turned and went behind the curtain. Then, an apologetic voice
came from inside the curtain,

“Princess White, I have committed a grave offense…”

“Merlin? What’s wrong?!”

There was a lot of back and forth behind the curtain. Merlin glossed
over our recent conversation and quickly concluded her reflection.

\*\*\*

“Let us now commence the highlight of the Jeblem! Let the ‘Arc Ball
Race’ begin!!”

The voice of the announcer echoed through Märchen Academy.

The Arc Ball Race began.

<span id="0180_182_The_Grand_Festival_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 182: The Grand Festival (3)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (3) ༻**

Thirty minutes before the start of the Arc Ball race.

I changed into my gym clothes in the waiting room.

It was specially made by some second-year Class B students of the Magic
Department.

The Arc Ball race was a team event, so a coordinated uniform was a
requirement.

I looked around. The others had changed into gym clothes with the same
design.

‘Ohh.’

Maybe it was because we were wearing matching clothes for the festival,
but I felt a stronger sense of belonging than usual. It reminded me of
high school festivals, and I was secretly excited.

With the safety gear on my knees, elbows, and head, I was ready to go.

I sat down and put my safety gear on the table next to me.

My teammates were already in full safety gear. The reason I was slower
than them was because I came to the waiting room late.

I used \[Clairvoyance\] to watch the Clover Paladin enter the first-year
waiting room of the Magic Department. I couldn’t help but be anxious
because I didn’t know what he would do to White.

“Tristan already went out.”

“Tristan was so excited. Uhh, I’m shaking like crazy…”

“I’m going out first, Isaac. Come out when you’re ready.”

I nodded indifferently and said, ‘Okay,’ to the main character, Ian
Fairytale.

The team was about to leave when the door on the other side suddenly
swung open, and they stopped in their tracks.

“Huh…?”

Everyone looked shocked.

***What’s up with them?***

I turned my gaze toward the door and it suddenly made sense.

“President?”

“What is the Student Council President doing here…?”

***Wait, what?***

As the surprise visitor came in, the team parted like the Red Sea.

Then, a beautiful woman with a gentle smile came into view. For a
second, time seemed to slow down before coming to a standstill.

She was neatly dressed in her uniform, with her light gold hair.

‘What are you doing here…?’

The Student Council President, Alice Carroll, walked straight up to me.

She bent down, resting her hands on her knees, until we were
face-to-face.

My teammates just stood there, frozen with wide-eyed shock.

“Hi, Baby.”

“Senior Alice? Why are you here…?”

“No reason, I just miss you.”

My teammates’ mouths dropped open in disbelief and they started
whispering.

Alice, this girl really didn’t know right from wrong. Was that something
one said in front of people?

This was making things difficult for me. It was the same when she
visited White, it was clear she was trying to provoke a reaction out of
me.

Possibly because she was the type to easily brush off other people’s
murmurs, Alice didn’t mind it. But please, pay attention to their
chatters.

I gave her a half-hearted look, and Alice shifted her attention to the
safety gear on the table.

“Are you putting on your safety gear?”

“Yeah…”

“Hmm.”

Alice looked back at me with her cherry blossom-colored eyes.

“Could you hold still for a moment?”

“What?”

Alice picked up the safety gear beside me and slid it onto my arms.

***What the hell is she doing?***

“What are you doing?”

“I’m taking care of you, Baby.”

“No, I can see…”

“Lucky for you, then.”

Alice offered a warm smile.

‘…Hilde, do you think she’s putting on some sort of device on me?’

\[I do not believe that to be the case.\]

Hilde communicated telepathically, hiding as a faint glimmer around my
collar.

For some reason, it seemed like Alice was just putting on my safety
gear.

My teammates gaped in disbelief, rooted in their spot, as I received the
undivided attention of the esteemed Student Council President.

***When are they going to leave?***

“Is it okay for the Student Council President to do this?”

“It seems you’ve forgotten that I’m a spectator. I’m on your side. As a
spectator, it’s okay for me to be biased, isn’t it?”

She used the word biased so blatantly. She must have her own position
too.

That was her own problem, so I didn’t have to worry about it.

“So, you came here to cheer me on?”

“That’s correct.”

“Why?”

“Because I like Baby.”

Alice knelt down, pressed her knees together, and began putting on the
safety gear on my knees.

With a click, the gear was safely fastened all over my body.

Finally, Alice picked up the helmet with both hands and carefully placed
it on my head, a satisfied smile on her face.

“All set\~. Hehe, so cute.”

Alice patted my helmet.

If we weren’t enemies, I would have found it beyond adorable.

“Well then, Baby, don’t get hurt and do well. I’ll be cheering for you.”

“Ah, okay… Thanks.”

With a polite yet guarded smile, I rose to my feet.

I made my way past Alice and left the room, my teammates were still
gaping at me in sheer disbelief.

“Let’s get out of here.”

“Yeah…”

I exited through the door with my dazed teammates in tow. They exchanged
glances between Alice and I, pointlessly speculating about our
relationship.

As I glanced back, I saw Alice waving at me with a genuinely warm smile
still spread across her face.

It was intriguing. Perhaps she was planning to install some strange
device in the waiting room after we left?

As long as Phantom Cat Cheshire was present, I couldn’t monitor Alice
with \[Clairvoyance\].

So after the Arc Ball race, and before we entered the waiting room, I
had to check inside with \[Clairvoyance\] first.

‘Of course, I have to do that.’

…I doubt Alice would carelessly cause trouble in the waiting room. She
wouldn’t want to risk becoming a suspect in case something dangerous
happened.

I gave Alice a curt nod and then headed down the hallway with my
teammates.

Along the way, I was bombarded with questions about my relationship with
the Student Council President, whether we were dating, and what happened
with Luce, but I brushed them all off.

\*\*\*

Under the broad daylight sky, at the outdoor stadium.

Students from various departments stood at the starting line. It was
like a marathon was about to start.

Around them, square-shaped bleachers encircled the stadium, structured
so that spectators could view the entire route of the Arc Ball race from
any direction.

Race participants were dressed in gym clothes according to their class’
concept. It made identifying team members easy. As I noticed earlier,
the clothes were stretchy and easy to move in.

Oddly enough, the participants from the first-year Class D of the Magic
Department had the stiletto-like hairstyles that I saw during the Grand
Festival preparations. Of course, not wanting to be bothered, I ignored
them.

‘Okay.’

I warmed up a little. I was in good condition.

The first day of the Grand Festival, the first Arc Ball race.

Fortunately, there had been no incidents involving White. But now, the
real game began.

The Clover Paladin glanced at me briefly before clicking his tongue with
a frown.

However, he quickly composed himself and flashed a charming alpha-male
smile at the group of female students who were looking at him from the
stands, screaming, ‘Kyaah.’

Each time, the decibels of the girls’ voices increased.

***What an uproar…***

Then, the Clover Paladin’s face stiffened in annoyance.

He had been like that ever since he saw my name on the participant list.
He realized his plan to make me watch helplessly as White suffered had
been thwarted.

However, he hadn’t completely abandoned his plan. He still intended to
attack White to provoke me.

Now the real battle began.

On the other team, I saw Dorothy. When our eyes met, she flashed a smile
and waved her hand at me like she had been waiting for it.

‘So pretty.’

I felt an urge to hug her tightly. Seeing her warm smile made my heart
leap into my chest.

On the other side, White was shivering in excitement and nervousness.

***Good luck, White.***

I also recognized other familiar faces.

Among my peers from Class A, Lisetta Lionheart was participating. She
seemed pretty excited at the thought of clashing with others.

But when our eyes met, she quickly turned her head away in fright.

***Is she still scared of me…?***

It was disheartening how she reacted like that every time she saw me,
even though I wanted us to get along.

“Ha!”

Among my teammates, the vain blond nobleman, Tristan Humphrey, let out a
gallant chuckle.

“This heat! These cheers! Truly a perfect stage for this body! Kaha…!”

*Bam bam bam.*

The band began to play, and Tristan gasped and began to choke in his
laughter, coughing in surprise.

“And now!! The moment you’ve all been waiting for has arrived!!”

The lively voice of the announcer echoed throughout the academy. It was
Amy Holloway, a girl with short white hair adorned with black ribbons
that were tied to resemble the shape of rabbit ears, and also Ian’s
girlfriend.

As the announcer, she was also dressed up in pretty clothes for the
occasion.

Standing at the announcer’s booth above the stadium, she energetically
shouted into the megaphone as the band played in the background.

“All participants have assembled! The preparations for the Arc Ball race
are now complete!”

The students in the stands let out a unified cheer.

And the band’s music changed to an upbeat tune.

‘Amy looks excited…’

***This is nice.***

My teammate, Ian Fairytale, also smiled fondly upon seeing his
enthusiastic girlfriend.

“Before we start the Arc Ball race, let’s go over the rules briefly! The
competition will take place over 3 days, skipping a day in between the 5
days of Jeblem! Teams will be selected based on their performance to
advance to the next round!”

It meant that the tournament would be held every other day.

“Now\~, everyone, please raise your heads and look at the sky!”

Amy raised her right arm and pointed toward the sky, prompting both
participants and the audience to look up.

I also gazed up at the sky.

Above the stadium, in the air, numerous mana particles moved around,
clinking and clanking through telekinesis, orchestrated by the delicate
magic of the Hegel Tower Master, Aria Lilias.

It was the same as the end-of-semester evaluation when I was a first
year. That immense mana mastery was as impressive as always.

The mana particles formed a map mimicking the surroundings. The route
and destination of the Arc Ball race shone brightly in vivid colors.

“The race track extends to the outskirts of Märchen Academy, and today’s
destination is Bartos Hall! The first six teams to reach the destination
with the Arc Ball will advance to the next round! The rest,
unfortunately, will be eliminated! On the last day, the top three teams
will receive the very, *very* nice prizes announced during the opening
ceremony, so everyone, do your best!”

All participants shouted, ‘Woah!’ Raising their arms in excitement. I
joined in too.

“Lastly, let’s hear some words from the idol of our female students, the
cool and handsome, Professor Fernando Frost!!”

As Amy pointed to the silver-haired, handsome Professor among the
faculty, the female students screamed their lungs out, almost roaring.

Fernando cleared his throat with an, ‘Ahem’.

He picked up the megaphone and spoke firmly and without expression.

“First-year Class D of the Magic Department, be prepared if you get
eliminated. I’ll double your homework.”

“Impossible!! A terrifying statement I hoped I’d never hear!! But, it
looks like my juniors are now motivated! Excellent!!”

Aside from the horrified first-year Class D students of the Magic
Department, the rest of the academy erupted in laughter.

“Now, then\~!”

With a beaming smile, Amy stretched out one arm forward.

“We now commence the crowning event of Jeblem! Let the Arc Ball race
begin!!”

*Boom!*

A firework made of fire magic bursts in the sky, creating colorful
patterns in the air.

The band played a grand and lively melody.

Students cheered, each supporting their team, creating an electric
atmosphere.

And then.

“All participants, get ready!!”

As Amy raised her right arm, students on either end of the starting line
raised their flags forward. At the same time, the cheers from the entire
academy died down.

A heavy tension filled the air. I bent my upper body slightly and braced
my knees, ready to run.

I had a few goals during the Arc Ball race. Protect White, land a blow
on the Clover Paladin, to win a prize, and although uncertain, I hoped
to gain some EXP as well.

I glanced at the Clover Paladin, Pierre Flanche. He was eyeing his
target, Snow White. He looked like a creep.

I was going to take this opportunity to show him how foolish his plans
were.

Soon, Amy threw her arms up and shouted, her voice filled with laughter.

“Race start!!”

The flag was raised.

Amidst the cheers and shouts of the students, I, along with the other
participants, crossed the starting line and dashed forward.

Chapter 183: The Grand Festival (4)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (4) ༻**

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱「Act 8, Chapter 1, The Grand Festival」

Players could choose from various sports events.

Depending on their choice different events would occur, ensuring that
one could always play the sport one wanted.

Regardless of the scenario, one could freely play various mini-games
themed around the sports events of the Grand Festival. I remember having
quite a bit of fun with them.

Among them, the sport considered the highlight of The Grand Festival was
the Arcball Race.

Going into the detailed rules would be headache-inducing, so to put it
simply, what was the Arcball Race?

It was a race where you passed an ‘Arcball’ among team members while
running a designated course, and the order of arrival at the destination
determined the ranking.

Arcball was a magic tool in the shape of a ball that was tightly packed
with lightning mana. It was about the size of my fist.

This ball must be caught with a unique netless racket, which combined
the appearance of a tennis racket and a butterfly net. Physical contact
was considered a foul in this game.

An Arcball caught in the racket was incapacitated for 2 minutes, meaning
it regained its functionality and escaped after 2 minutes.

Therefore, passing between team members was essential to keep the
Arcball continuously incapacitated.

Amidst the chaos, I moved my feet, blending in with the participants.

“Let’s go!!”

“Everyone, move aside!!”

“Wowww!”

In the meantime, Lisetta Lionheart, a Class A delinquent with an orange
ponytail, pushed forward. Being robust, she didn’t lose out in the
physical altercation.

Then, in front of the large passage leading out of the stadium, mana
concentrated, and with a crackling noise, it formed into a ball emitting
currents.

It was about the size of my fist. It was the Arcball.

“Now!! The Arcball has been generated!! Who will take the lead?!!”

*Whoosh─!*

As expected, a female student with light purple hair swiftly swooped in
and scooped up the Arcball with her racket.

A myriad of colorful stars swirled around her.

“Nihihi.”

The goddess stretched out one arm towards the students, spreading her
index and middle fingers into a v-shape.

Dorothy pressed down on the witch hat on her head and smiled brightly.
The Arcball, passing through her racket was caught and couldn’t move due
to the crackling lightning mana flowing from the racket.

“Is it as expected?! Our Märchen Academy’s celebrity! Player Dorothy
Heartnova is the first to catch the Arcball!!”

As announcer Amy Holloway shouted, cheers from the students spread,
especially from Dorothy’s fans.

On the other hand, several participants stood in a daze or clicked their
tongues.

Of course, I was happy.

***Dorothy, do whatever you want.***

With Dorothy in the lead, the participants, including myself, passed
through the stadium corridor and went outdoors.

From the passage, mana particles shone brightly, forming a very long
track.

The rule of the Arcball race was to pass through the track with the
Arcball and reach the destination.

Each time a team completed the race, the mana particles would move
around, and the track would be reconfigured to be shorter. Thus, the
first track was the longest.

We ran along the track.

“You guys, hurry up!”

Dorothy couldn’t rashly push forward.

After all, if she took the Arcball first, she would have to pass it to
her teammates within 2 minutes.

Teammates using physical contact or magic on each other was considered a
foul. it was a regulation to prevent solo runs.

But what if it wasn’t between teammates?

‘They can hit each other.’

As long as one got past the safe line, and as long as the path wasn’t
blocked, it was possible to attack competitors with 1 and 2-star magic.
It was going to turn into a mud fight.

Ah. Physical contact was allowed between competitors unless they were
holding each other, and this was independent of the safe line.

Anyway.

‘It’s all about teamwork.’

That was why everyone was watching each other.

Dorothy’s team strategy was clear at a glance, so much so that there was
no need to use \[Psychological Insight\].

Her speeding ahead as the leader meant her team members would also be
moving forward.

If Dorothy’s team kept the Arcball and stayed ahead until they crossed
the upcoming safe line, the race would inevitably turn in her favor.

But the folks here were not easy fools. Already frustrated at losing the
lead to Dorothy, would they let things go her way?

Dorothy, being in a small class of A, was placed in a team mixed across
classes, indicating her teammates were not at her level.

As expected, other participants began to closely monitor and challenge
the third-year students who were dressed like Dorothy. Dorothy was
formidable, but her teammates were seen as easy targets.

This was why taking the lead early on was not good.

“What should we do…?”

Dorothy, flying with starlight mana, broke into a sweat as she watched
her teammates, rendered helpless by the strategic checks and challenges
from many students. Her distress was evident.

Soon.

*Squeak─.*

“Ugh!”

After 2 minutes, the lightning mana flowing through Dorothy’s net faded,
and the Arcball regained its function, quickly escaping.

The Arcball, swift as a fly, zipped through the air.

The Arcball moved busily back and forth along the track, within reach if
one only jumped high enough.

Dorothy hastily chased after the Arcball, but…

“Aaaargh!!”

As if they had been waiting, many students rushed at once towards the
Arcball that had been freed from Dorothy.

*Thud.*

*Crash.*

*Thump.*

There was a fierce skirmish, with students pushing and tackling each
other. While students from the Knight Department with their superior
physical abilities took the lead, those flying with wind magic were
almost as fast.

“Everybody move awaaay!”

*Woong─!*

Rock pillars shot up from the ground.

The delinquent of Class A, Lisetta Lionheart, soared up on a rock pillar
and quickly jumped down.

With her rock-element magic weapon, Rock Bat, slung over her shoulder,
she sprang up, hopping from one male student’s head to another.

Weapons were allowed as long as they weren’t swung at other
participants, but most didn’t use them because they were cumbersome
along with the racket.

‘The important thing is quick action and mobility.’

Moreover, handling a magic weapon like Rock Bat required complex mana
mastery. It was not quite suitable for the Arcball Race, where combat
wasn’t a main element, as it would only be a distraction.

However, it seemed Lisetta felt uneasy without Rock Bat in her hand.

The poor male students served as Lisetta’s stepping stones, giving her
momentum before falling backward.

She was also one of the athletic types in the Magic Department, a fact
anyone could tell just by looking at her body.

With her orange gym shirt half-undone, assertively emphasizing her
prominent chest, Lisetta was the epitome of confidence.

*Crackle.*

The Arcball was caught in Lisetta’s racket. She landed on the ground
with a thud, laughed heartily, and dashed along the track with her
teammates.

The participants sighed.

“What a mess.”

I nodded in agreement with Tristan Humphrey’s calm tone.

Our team leisurely ran and watched the scene unfold.

That was our strategy, to observe during the fiercely competitive early
stages and start making our move after crossing the early to mid-part
safe line.

‘Strategy aside.’

I naturally planned to strike a blow on Pierre Flanche. Yes, I was
focused on taking down just one guy.

Amy’s voice, broadcasting the progress of the Arcball race, reached us
there.

The race situation had to be shown to the audience in real-time through
messengers. It was possible, given the structure of the stadium, to see
what was happening outside.

A giant map made of mana particles unfolded in the sky. The position of
each participant was marked on it like a GPS.

Soon, several participants dashed forward, trying to surround Lisetta’s
team.

“Hey! Catch!”

“Hya!”

Lisetta, leading the way, swung her racket as if were a game of tennis
towards her teammate, and the Arcball flew fast like a baseball.

Lisetta’s teammate was surprised but managed to catch the flying Arcball
with the racket. The lightning mana sparked up instantly, securing the
Arcball.

*Grrrrrr──!*

Lisetta pulled up rocks from beneath her feet. A pillar of rock shot up
diagonally in front of her, startling the students who failed to
intercept in time.

The teammate immediately swung the net, throwing the Arcball back
towards Lisetta.

Lisetta tried to catch the Arcball, which flew like a tennis ball, with
her racket leisurely.

*Thud.*

Dorothy swooped in swiftly and snatched the Arcball away.

Lisetta grimaced fiercely and yelled irritably, ‘Aaang?!’

“Nihihi! Go on, try to catch it if you can…!”

*Beep─*.

“Huh?”

As Dorothy hastily flew too high, a warning beep sounded from her scoop.

“Ah! Dorothy Heartnova has violated the height limit! Oh no!
Unfortunately, that’s a disqualification!”

“…Eh?”

Announcer Amy shouted.

Due to the disqualification, Dorothy’s racket was forcibly disabled. The
Arcball immediately left her racket.

“Ah…!”

Realizing the situation, Dorothy trembled with a look of utter despair,
just watching the Arcball drift away.

***Such a pity.***

In the Arcball Race, one must not ascend beyond a certain height on
their own or with the help of teammates.

This rule also prevented solo runs and was a major issue that undermined
the fundamental fun of the Arcball Race, resulting in immediate
disqualification.

Dorothy seemed to have been so focused on securing the Arcball that she
failed to gauge the height limit.

The sight of third-year students from the Magic Department and Dorothy’s
fans screaming in the stands was vivid in my mind.

‘I’ll have to comfort her after the race ends…’

The fleeing Arcball was caught by a male student. He moved forward,
chuckling with his teammates.

Of course, they too had the Arcball snatched away by another team before
long.

And so, the struggle for the Arcball continued.

Suddenly, the light green line on the ground, the safe line, began to
appear. It was time to prepare for battle.

The ones ahead, fighting over the Arcball, started hurling 1 and 2-star
elemental spells at each other as soon as they crossed the safe line.

Being only 1 or 2-star, the magic wasn’t as lethal as during a duel. It
was used merely for checking each other.

Note that using magic against students who haven’t crossed the safe line
or blocking their path was against the rules. That was why those ahead
only fought among themselves.

It was almost time. The safe line was getting closer.

Pierre Flanche, the Clover Paladin, and Snow White, my mentee, were also
nearing the safe line.

As Pierre’s teammates began to move ahead, excluding him, I exchanged
glances with my teammates and nodded slightly.

I circulated mana within my mana circuit, gathering ice mana and
spreading my right hand.

I could feel the mana of the students around me gradually spreading.

And then, the moment we crossed the safe line.

“…!”

“What…?”

*Whoosh.*

As a powerful mana burst forth, students felt a chill run down their
spines.

The source was, of course, just one person. Excluding the disqualified
Dorothy, he was the strongest among the current participants.

A man with beige fine hair and light green eyes.

It was Pierre Flanche.

*Whooooosh──!!*

“Aaaaah!”

“Eeeek!”

Water elemental magic burst forth from Pierre, swirling with terrifying
force. It was massive. Despite being a basic 1-star spell \[Water
Generation\], many students were helplessly swept away.

Simultaneously, high waves surged along the track.

His basic water magic devastated the surroundings in an instant.

<span id="0182_184_Chapter_185_-_The_Grand_Festival.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 184: Chapter 185 - The Grand Festival
=============================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (5) ༻**

The principle of the Helize Church was to be built in a style rich with
curves, as it was defined in the scriptures.

At a location of Märchen Academy, atop a spire soaring towards the sky,
there was a statue of a pierced crescent moon symbolizing the Helize
Church. The churches of Helize surrounded that spire.

Church sanctuary.

The Saintess with light pink hair, Bianca Anturaze, was sitting alone in
the pews.^1^EDMIn Note: Pews are basically the long benches you see in
church.

She was covered in a pure white saint’s robe, adorned with golden
ornaments and a veil over her head. It was an attire a saint had to wear
during the period of the public ceremony. Because of her status as a
Saintess, Bianca Anturaze had to maintain a restrained appearance.

After offering prayers to Manhala as the academy’s representative at the
opening of the public ceremony, she returned to the church to complete
her private prayers.

The church was devout and quiet, in contrast to the fervor of the public
ceremony.

Bianca held a book in her hand.

An old book from Carly Hall, the once most prestigious building in the
old campus of Märchen Academy where the Nameless Hero did battle with
Thunderbird Galia.

She had already read it several times.

Bianca thought that the cause of her finding this book was divine
intervention, which was the reason why she kept reading it over and
over.

Although she still couldn’t read the characters that were both neat and
round,

She could definitely recognize the pictures.

‘Where is this?’

Rain made of blood fell endlessly. It was possible to recognize the
figure as deliberately drawn with the observer’s own blood.

There was a hole in the sky as if the ground had been turned upside
down.

The rainwater seeped into the vast lake.

Around the lake, several things were stationed. They looked like solid
masses, but it was hard to determine exactly what they were.

Looking around the world, there were no places with holes in the sky,
and even if there were, rain made of blood would not fall to make a lake
similar to this.

The scriptures of the Helize Church did not mention such ominous places.
Then, where exactly was this?

“Holy Saintess. Are you sure it’s okay not to participate in the public
ceremony?”

Sylon, the escort priest standing in the corner of the sanctuary, asked
as if probing, and Saintess Bianca slightly turned her head towards him.

Bianca still had her eyes closed. Whether she opened or closed them, the
lost vision of her body wouldn’t return.

She could only ‘see’ with her mysterious divine power. If the power was
depleted, she would be thrown back into a world of darkness.

“There are many lambs that will become the playthings of the Lord. I
merely struggle to deeply understand the holy will of the Lord through
my prayers. Isn’t that the mission of one who has become a saint?”

A refined voice. It was a solemn nuance befitting a saint.

Bianca turned her head back to the book.

“Now, I want to know as soon as possible what this book is about and to
whom I should deliver it.”

She was prepared to give her life if it was the will of the Lord.

She did not know the author’s identity. However, the fact that this book
had come into her hands must have certainly been the will of the Lord.

Therefore, she did indeed have to deliver the book to this person to its
destined recipient.

And the identity of that recipient was already becoming clear.

“No, there’s no need to worry about one of them…”

Certainly, there was some mystery hidden here in Märchen Academy.

Even the Saintess herself could not fathom such an enormous secret.

It was all too clear who stood amidst that secret.

“‘The Nameless Hero… It must be him. This book has to be passed on to
him.”

The Nameless Hero, the enigmatic Archwizard.

***The book must be delivered to him.***

“Sylon. I will deliver this book to the Nameless Hero. Even if my limbs
are crushed, and my body battered, I will crawl on the ground like a
desperate worm if necessary. Isn’t that the will of the Lord?”

Beyond the colorful stained glass engraved on the ceiling.

The midday sunlight seeped in, brilliantly illuminating the symbol of
the Lord.

“So, if my breath ceases and my soul returns to the Lord’s side, please,
I hope you will deliver this book to him. Even if your limbs are
severed, your eyes gouged out, or half of your body is blown away,
please prioritize the mission.”

Sylon approached the Saintess’ side, knelt on one knee, and bowed his
head.

He had no hesitation. Having his life once saved by the Saintess, he had
already vowed to dedicate his life to the Lord and the Saintess.

“…Yes, I understand.”

Bianca let out a refined smile.

\* \* \*

On the Arcball Race Track. When they crossed the safety line.

The ones ahead were shocked and turned around, gaping at the immense
mana of the Clover Paladin, Pierre Flanche.

‘Outrageous.’

***Such a level of basic elemental magic. Isn’t that too ridiculous?***

Well, it was to be expected.

However, we were already prepared.

“…What?”

Pierre showed a surprised expression. It was because the outcome had
deviated from his expectations.

“Kahaha!!”

Tristan was already flying along the track at an incredible speed, with
wind wrapped around his body.

*Whoosh!*

Our protagonist, Ian Fairytale, was rocketing through the air, arms
stretched back, explosively casting fire elemental magic.

Although his skills were not yet enough to match Tristan’s speed, it was
a respectable level on its own.

Our team’s male student, Doji Tu Mals, whose presence was strong
sometimes and then quiet like an outsider, lifted a pillar of rock from
beneath his feet like Lisetta, dodging whirlpools and waves.

The highly dense water magic shattered even his rock pillar, but by that
time, Doji had already escaped Pierre’s attack range.

There were zero casualties on our team. Moreover, Snow White, his
target, wasn’t swept away by the water magic.

Pierre quickly turned his gaze to find White and me.

“Waaah! Senioooor Isaac!!!”

*Splash─!*

Holding White, I created an ice board beneath my feet and surfed on the
wave created by Pierre.

White screamed so much that my ears hurt.

Hair and clothes fluttered wildly. Even our shoes were frozen to the ice
board, securing our feet in place.

I froze the surface of the wave as I went, stretching forward at high
speed. Even in the midst of this, thanks to my trained physique, it was
quite easy to maintain my balance.

I had made a secret agreement with White’s team.

Since White was my mentee, I had vowed to protect her if anything
happened.

I had also informed our team, and they all agreed.

Perhaps because of the incident during the Duel evaluation when White
was rag-dolled by the Priestess and I got angry, the atmosphere was one
of understanding towards my feelings among the students.

Additionally, under the pretext of cautioning against Pierre Flanche,
who was known for his high mana quality and quantity, we also shared our
strategy.

The moment we crossed the safety line, we decided to go full throttle,
like blasting boosters in a kart game, to prepare for the eventuality of
Pierre trying to annihilate everyone.

‘I had already figured it out with \[Psychological Insight\].’

Thanks to that, our team and White’s stiletto-haired team successfully
avoided Pierre’s attack.

‘Oh.’

We had climbed quite high. Pierre’s astonished face looked down on us.

“Ha! Worms!”

Tristan in a single breath cut through the air, passing every other
student and reaching the Arcball.

He had gotten even faster. I couldn’t grasp how much more he had trained
since his defeat to me.

Tristan intercepted the Arcball that had been caught in another
student’s racket. Since there were no actual nets to speak of, it was
perfectly feasible to snatch the ball away by swinging it through
someone else’s racket.

Several students were taken aback by Tristan’s sudden appearance.

“Ah!”

“Don’t lose it!”

However, judging that he couldn’t handle all the competitors swarming
around him, Tristan immediately passed the Arcball to Ian.

The Arcball flew at a high speed, and Ian easily caught it with his
scoop.

Lightning mana flowed out, securing the Arcball.

“Tch!”

Pierre, who was relatively close, swung water magic towards Ian. In an
instant, water magic formed around Ian, rising up in the form of a wave.

It would have been hard to avoid that.

*Whoosh─!*

“Isaac!!”

Then Ian swung his racket and threw the Arcball towards me, who was
surfing on Pierre’s wave.

I swiftly caught the flying Arcball with my racket.

*Zap.*

Lightning mana flowed from my racket, securing the Arcball.

***Good.***

*Whoosh!!*

“Aaah!”

Ian was swept away by the wave out of the track and lost consciousness
due to the barrage of water magic cast upon him.

Ian hit his back against a tree and closed his eyes.

***Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.***

It wasn’t just him. Looking back, many students swept away by Pierre’s
water magic were groaning in pain or rolling on the ground, most of them
unconscious.

***Thanks for eliminating the competition.***

Well. Pierre was one of Alice’s most powerful subordinates, a Paladin.

Due to his highly dense mana, even a basic water spell felt like getting
hit by iron rather than just water.

Anyway, the next step was clear. Pierre had unabashedly revealed himself
to be the most dangerous person in this race. That meant, I also had
ample reason to unleash my attacks on him without reservation.

“White! Take out the staff!”

“Hngh…!”

As previously discussed, White took out a magic pouch from within her
robes and then took out Zhonya’s Staff from it. It was a magic pouch
that held just that singular weapon.

The magic pouch was tossed aside, and in White’s hands, she wielded a
magic weapon as big as herself.

Hugging me tightly, White pressed it against my chest, and I firmly
grasped Zhonya’s Staff.

“Whoa!! From the moment they crossed the safe line, it’s been absolute
chaos!! Amidst it all, Isaac, riding on an ice sheet, advances through
the wave created by Pierre Flanche and secures the Arcball!!”

Amy’s voice echoed throughout Märchen Academy via the loudspeakers
placed all around.

*Whoosh─.*

Pierre withdrew his water mana. The slowly subsiding wave instantly
turned into blue powder and scattered in the wind.

“Aaaaah!!”

I felt a sense of buoyancy. As we started to fall swiftly downwards,
White tightly wrapped her arms around my shoulders, hugging me tightly
and screaming at the top of her lungs with her eyes firmly shut.

During the fall, I looked at Pierre.

Around Pierre, water mana was still swirling, ready for both offense and
defense at all times.

Ignoring White’s ear-splitting screams, I calmly extended Zhonya’s Staff
toward him, directing the energy of the dawn contained within the mana
stone at him.

Then, I unleashed a torrent of pale blue ice mana. I executed the
complex mana mastery I had practiced countless times to wield Zhonya’s
Staff swiftly

A powerful current flowed. Completely freezing Pierre’s formidable water
mana was still beyond my capabilities.

However, it wasn’t necessary to freeze every bit of his water mana.

*Crackle!*

My \[Elemental Efficiency\] was top-notch. Meaning, the area in which I
could cast magic was quite extensive.

At the center of the whirlpool, I froze the water mana around Pierre.

\[Elemental Synergy\] was activated. The power and effect of ice spells
used to freeze water were enhanced.

Realizing I was aiming to freeze his own body, Pierre’s eyes widened in
shock, and he quickly dissolved the whirlpool.

That wasn’t my aim.

*Groooow──!*

“…!!”

At the same time, shadows formed around Pierre.

Shockwave. Only then did he look up and notice the large chunks of ice
falling toward him.

One after the other, I created several large chunks of ice in rapid
succession, aiming at the escape routes where he could potentially run.

Above the ice chunks falling towards Pierre, I also created icicles for
a secondary attack.

This feat was only possible due to the amount of water mana he had
spread. I even absorbed the remnants of his scatted mana to amplify my
power even further.

My target was solely Pierre.

“Is he crazy?! How did he do that so quickly…?”

“That bastard…!”

Tristan and Lisetta seemed surprised to see me create several large
chunks of ice with basic elemental magic in one go.

Just before White and I hit the ground, I created an ice slide and slid
down on an ice board smoothly. As soon as we touched the ground, I
dissolved the ice board and started running again.

*Boom─!*

Behind me, the ice chunks fell to the ground from a distance.

A cloud of white dust from the low temperature rose, and a loud noise
echoed, mimicking a mini earthquake for just a moment.

Pierre was alone, and with nowhere to run, he took the full brunt of the
falling ice.

“Senior Isaac!!! It, it was so scary…!!”

“I thought my ears would fall off because of your screaming.”

While running with White in a princess carry, I urged her on. It was
quite uncomfortable with a racket in my right hand and Zhonya’s Staff in
my left.

I looked back.

Amidst the white mist, a chillingly eerie mana burst forth. Of course,
one wouldn’t faint just from that.

“…Isaac…”

The figure who emerged, brushing off the dust with a swing of his arm,
was Pierre, bleeding from beneath his beige hair. The furrow in his
brow, filled with murderous intent, was particularly striking.

To think he was in that condition even after taking a direct hit from a
large ice chunk that was enhanced by \[vs Human Combat Power\], Zhonya’s
Staff, and my absurd \[Elemental Synergy\].

***Seems like he took my ice attack with nothing but his \[Basic
Protection Magic\]. Impressive.***

“White, hold onto the staff for me.”

“Ah, yes!”

“Hold it tight.”

“What…? Aaah!!”

After handing Zhonya’s Staff to White, I used all the strength in my leg
muscles to sprint down the track.

The Arcball remained secured in my racket.

From behind, Pierre, and from the front, other participants
simultaneously lunged towards me.

Chapter 185: The Grand Festival (6)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (6) ༻**

A video of Isaac embracing Princess Snow White while running was played
in the middle of the stadium, in mid-air.

The entire academy gaped at the sight.

No matter how close they were as mentor and mentee, they were still a
commoner and a princess.

But Isaac looked like a prince straight out of a fairytale as he saved
the princess.

Despite being in Isaac’s embrace, White showed not a hint of rejection
as she clung even tighter to him.

The only blemish was her unbecoming manner of crying.

“…”

The expression of Luce Eltania, a female student whose rose gold hair
was elaborately styled, was filled with a sinister aura. Her eyes were
fixed on the video like someone plotting a murder.

The second-year Magic Department students gathered around were
overwhelmed by her murderous intent, trembling with fear.

Princess Snow White. Her relationship with Isaac must have grown close
through almost daily mentoring.

The fact that some of the limited time she could spend with Isaac was
allocated to that woman… It was enough to make Luce shudder.

To her, the sobbing White looked like nothing but a conniving vixen as
she clung to Isaac. Such a sight only served to intensify Luce’s
wariness.

Meanwhile, in a seat in the audience.

A beautiful female student with light green pigtails was trembling, her
fists clenched.

Her face twitched repeatedly. She stared blankly at the video with her
jade-colored eyes, unable to control her shaking body.

“I… I haven’t… received it yet…”

Kaya Astrea murmured to herself in a soft, sighing voice.

***A princess carry from Sir Isaac.***

She remembered when Lisetta Lionheart received a princess carry from
Isaac during last year’s joint practical evaluation.

She hadn’t received one herself yet… It was something she had only
enjoyed in her imagination up till now…

Princess Snow White received it first… How could this be?

She knew the circumstances, but she had not expected White to be
protected in such a manner.

Kaya was so jealous of White that it was almost palpable.

“Ah!! As many students rushed at Isaac at once!! Indeed, how will Isaac
overcome this crisis?!”

The announcer, Amy, shouted with an excited voice.

Running while the princess was in his embrace. Indeed, his friend,
Isaac, was pleasantly insane.

On the Arcball race track. The remaining participants were swarming
towards Isaac.

The second-year student with silver-blue hair, Isaac, looked straight
ahead and spoke.

“White, take off my glasses.”

“Huh, yes…!”

Snow White, who was sobbing in Isaac’s arms, took off his glasses. The
reason her tears hadn’t stopped was because the shock of having ridden
on thrilling waves and then abruptly crashing was still being stirred in
her heart.

The glasses that she had just taken off were a magic tool, Ribella’s
glasses.

Just as wearing sandbags and then taking them off could make one’s body
feel temporarily lighter, wearing those glasses and then taking them off
allowed one to follow the flow of mana more easily for a while.

Isaac’s eyes quickly scanned the competitors swarming in from the front.

“Hand it over!!”

“Give us the Arcball!!”

*Woooosh!*

Using the 2-star spell \[Cold Divergence\], Isaac spread a pure white
mist with fierce momentum.

The participants attacked Isaac with elemental magic or their rackets,
cutting through the mist.

He skillfully dodged the attacks or countered with elemental magic,
moving past the students.

Isaac, despite the limitation of holding White, dazzled as he bypassed
his competitors.

His remarkable physical abilities allowed him to follow the flow of mana
even in the cold, dodging his opponent’s magic or using elemental magic
at the right moments, showing excellent judgment and reflexes.

Truly an artful movement. The students who had rushed at Isaac were
astounded by his dazzling movements, it was difficult to believe that he
had come from the Magic Department.

Only top students from the Knight Department could possibly hope to
match him.

“Aah!”

“What do you think you’re doing attacking me, idiot!”

As the chill thickened, participants began attacking each other
indiscriminately due to their obscured vision.

By the time many students had dispelled the mist with basic elemental
magic, Isaac had already passed through the mist and gone beyond all the
students who had rushed at him.

“What…?!”

The students were bewildered as they watched Isaac, who was ahead,
running fast on the race track.

***Is he really running while embracing a woman? What kind of speed is
that?***

Cheers from the students erupted in the stands.

“Wow!! Isaac successfully dodged the attacks of numerous students!!
Amazing!!”

Announcer Amy shouted with a smiling face.

*Whoooaah!!*

At that moment, a chilling mana swept over the race track again.

Behind Isaac. Water mana pulsed through the air and waves of blue began
to crash with ferocity that belied the power of elemental magic.

“Ah, Senior Isaac…! Behind, behind you!!”

The wave naturally covered the race track. At that terrifying sight,
White’s pale face turned even paler.

“T-t-t-that! Is, is that basic elemental magic?!”

Even someone with a low mana perception could feel it. That wave
contained an enormous amount of water mana.

If White herself were to be swept away by that wave, fainting would be
the least of her worries.

Isaac casually turned his head back to check the wave sweeping the
ground.

“Does that even make sense…?”

“Arrrgh!”

“S-save me…! Aaah!”

The students who failed to attack Isaac looked at the approaching huge
wave with faces filled with horror.

They desperately turned to run, but the wave, arriving much faster,
swept them away first. It was a powerless end.

The man running behind the wave was Pierre Flanche. A first-year in the
Magic Department and a genius with Grade S mana.

Pierre’s popularity and reputation were partly due to his innate
abilities. Not many in this academy could win against him in a fight.

Amidst this, Isaac nodded in satisfaction.

“Good.”

“What?!”

Pierre’s ruthless attack was helpful in eliminating competitors. Isaac
had anticipated this.

The regrettable part was that Pierre’s teammates were still alive. They
must have agreed among themselves that Pierre would take care of the
rear.

“What now, that crazy guy!?”

Lisetta Lionheart, having not rushed at Isaac, was still running ahead.

As someone who knew the true capabilities of the archwizard Isaac, she
had no confidence to rush at him.

***Anyway, what kind of monster is that beige-haired junior who popped
out of nowhere?***

Although it was incomparably lower than the true mana Isaac displayed
when the Abyssal Sea Monster appeared, there was no denying that the
junior before her possessed tremendous mana.

“White put your arm around my shoulders and hug me. It’ll be
uncomfortable for a moment, but bear with me.”

“Yes, yes!”

The possession limit of 2 minutes for the Arcball was rapidly
approaching. They needed to pass the Arcball to a teammate quickly.

White wrapped her arms around Isaac’s shoulders and clung tightly to
him.

To prevent White from slipping away as her strength waned, Isaac created
rock cuffs around her arms to secure her.

One of Isaac’s hands left White’s shoulder.

As her center of gravity shifted towards her hips, White had to hug
Isaac even tighter, like someone hanging from a cliff.

“Huu, ah…!”

She couldn’t move. Yet, for some reason, being unable to move in Isaac’s
embrace seemed to ignite a fire in White’s heart.

It was a rather pleasant feeling of restraint and pressure. For White,
who was a teenage girl before she was a princess, it was a highly
stimulating sensation.

“Ah, ah, no…!”

***…Let’s restrain ourselves.***

Just like during the joint practical evaluation, she felt guilty for
harboring such lascivious desires towards a senior she respected.

White clenched her eyes shut and struggled to suppress her rising
passion.

She felt a murderous intent from somewhere, but it must have just been
her imagination.

“Tristan!”

Isaac swung his racket and threw the Arcball. Tristan, with light green
wind swirling around him, flew in at an incredible speed and easily
caught the Arcball, which was cutting through the air like a baseball.

“I’ll be right behind you!”

“Ha! Do as you like!”

Tristan moved ahead again.

Isaac released the rock cuffs that bound White’s hands and then grabbed
her shoulders again.

Isaac returned White to a princess carry again.

White’s cheeks were flushed, but she tried to compose her emotions and
maintain her usual expression.

However, she couldn’t stop her lips from quivering or her eyebrows from
twitching.

“White, you can fly with wind for a bit, right? Just like we practiced
before.”

White immediately understood that he meant for her to escape.

White was startled.

“Eh? What about you, Senior Isaac?”

“I’ll stop what’s coming behind us.”

“What?”

Behind them, the vast wave was still approaching relentlessly. It was
about to reach Isaac.

“H-h-h-how are you going to…?”

“Quick!”

“Ahh, yes! Uwaaah…!”

As wind flowed from White, Isaac let go of her.

*Whooosh!*

White flew away on the wind.

Her mana mastery wasn’t enough for her to fly for more than 10 seconds
without severe dizziness and disruption of her mana circuit, but it was
sufficient to escape.

Isaac stopped running. Like a car slamming on its brakes, the soles of
his shoes slid and screeched against the racetrack.

Isaac turned around. The wave was about to engulf him. The reason the
risen wave didn’t stop and continued was that Pierre was constantly
infusing it with mana.

There was no escaping him now.

Someone had to stop Pierre, and Isaac was ready to take on that role.

The wave, fundamentally a basic elemental spell, would be weaker than
most attack spells, but Pierre’s immense mana fortified it. Being swept
away would certainly mean unconsciousness.

Isaac slammed Zhonya’s staff into the ground, drawing up mana.

***Is he preparing to counter Pierre?***

The students in the stands held their breath, watching the scene unfold.

“…”

Pierre Flanche was still running along the racetrack, one arm extended
forward, channeling his mana, while the other wiped the blood from his
forehead.

Beyond the wave, Pierre could feel Isaac’s mana.

<span id="0184_186_The_Grand_Festival_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 186: The Grand Festival (7)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (7) ༻**

“As expected.”

Pierre sensed Isaac’s mana.

Isaac pulled up a pillar of rock from beneath his feet and shot up over
the waves at high speed.

Though it was just basic elemental magic and the rock’s strength would
be quite weak, Pierre knew that such skill was considered excellent at
the academy.

Isaac jumped off the rock pillar at just the right moment. He and Pierre
locked eyes.

Just when he thought Isaac might create another iceboard…

With a rustling sound, ice mana gathered and several large ice blocks
appeared in the air.

Isaac stepped on them and leaped forward. The large ice blocks,
momentarily suspended in the air, immediately fell to the ground with a
slight shock from his weight.

His silhouette against the sun caught Pierre’s eye. The shadow of a man
with the dazzling sunlight at his back chased him in a straight line.

Pierre stopped in his tracks and raised water mana in both hands.

Gradually, Isaac’s figure became clearer from the sunlight.

“…!!”

Then, Pierre’s eyes widened in shock.

It was then he noticed something following the mana stone attached to
Zhonya’s staff.

It was a magic circle for the 5-star ice spell \[Frost Explosion\].

It was a magic absolutely forbidden in the race.

“Khhhh!”

A smile curled on Pierre’s lips. It was a thrilling sight.

If the magic were to be activated, Isaac would be disqualified. In other
words, the man was using himself as a sacrificial pawn to eliminate
Pierre, the most dangerous participant in the race.

It was a common occurrence in the Arcball race. It was a team race.
Sacrificial pawns became a tactic.

Even for Pierre, with his Grade S mana, it would be impossible to
withstand Isaac’s 5-star elemental magic with just basic elemental
magic.

If he were to take that attack head-on, he would undoubtedly fall.

“You’re making this enjoyable…!”

The only option left was to counter, even if it meant disqualification.
Isaac forced such a choice upon Pierre.

Since Isaac’s goal was to protect White and self-destruct with Pierre.

Pierre gladly accepted Isaac’s challenge.

It was when Isaac almost reached Pierre. It felt as if time was moving
slowly.

Due to the delayed judgment of the situation, there was not enough time
for complicated magical calculations. However, he could calculate a
5-star spell in an instant.

Pierre conjured the magic circle for a 5-star water spell, \[Hydro
Cannon\].

Although he would be disqualified, Pierre smiled, rationalizing that it
was necessary to stop Isaac.

It was then.

Isaac, perhaps surprised, widened his eyes as if he had encountered an
unexpected sight.

“What?”

Pierre felt an unexpected mana from behind. He was so focused on Isaac
that he noticed it too late.

Flickering flames. The warmth enveloped his back.

Pierre, startled, quickly turned around.

“…?!”

A black-haired man, drenched in water, had just reached him.

Flames made of mana flickered around the sword he held in both hands,
making a whooshing sound.

“Ian Fairytale?!”

How could he not know who this black-haired man was?

Ian Fairytale. A character with the light element who the Evil God, who
was sealed in the abyss, wanted to kill.

***Hadn’t he been knocked unconscious?***

“No.”

He must have regained consciousness quickly after being knocked out.

Pierre’s basic elemental magic had failed to keep Ian, an SSS-Class
Master Fainter, knocked out for long.

Ian’s resistance to being knocked out was getting stronger, after all.

“The ones who will win are…!!”

Ian Fairytale roared as he swung his sword.

“…Us!!”

***Oh, what?***

Ian, who had been knocked out, had come back to life. It seemed he
charged as soon as he regained consciousness.

Could it be that he had grown to the point where he could quickly regain
consciousness even after being hit by one of Pierre’s waves?

“Marvelous…!”

Truly, it was a great leap forward.

Ian was holding a long sword, with his racket partially tucked into his
uniform’s trousers. The red flames blending with the blade trailed
behind him like a tail, it elongated as the air resisted.

Pierre kicked off the ground and hastily deployed a new magic circle
towards Ian. Perhaps due to the disruption of his mana and calculations,
his response towards me slackened. The magic circle for \[Hydro Cannon\]
was distorted.

Unfortunately for him, Ian and I, who were now charging at Pierre, were
considered anomalies with exceptional physical abilities,
uncharacteristic of the Magic Department.

It was awkward to say it myself, but no one could avoid getting hit when
Ian and I both targeted the same person simultaneously. I was confident
I wouldn’t lose track of Pierre either.

The distance had already closed. Our speed surpassed that of Pierre’s
casting

*Whoosh!*

Ian easily dodged the water spell that Pierre hastily released by
swiftly twisting his body. Pierre was greatly taken aback by movement
that seemingly defied the laws of physics.

***Do not underestimate our protagonist.***

Soon, the flaming sword drew a splendid straight line towards Pierre.

*Whoosh!!*

“Ugh, Aaagh!”

The strike of the fire sword engulfed Pierre and swept across the
ground.

With a boom, Pierre’s body burst into flames and was lifted into the
air.

‘Nice!’

***You’re the best, Ian!***

Even amidst the fierce flames, Pierre did not lose consciousness and
fired \[Hydro Cannon\] at me. His mental fortitude was truly admirable.

However, by then, I, who was falling, had already reached Pierre.

Releasing condensed ice mana, I extended Zhonya’s staff and activated
\[Frost Explosion\].

*Whooosh─.*

*Booooooom!*

The ice mana exploded right in front of Pierre’s nose.

The delayed activation of \[Hydro Cannon\] was swallowed by \[Frost
Explosion\]. Having been hit by Ian’s flaming sword strike and with the
activation timing delayed, his mana was ultimately disrupted by \[Frost
Explosion\].

The ice mass fiercely stretched toward the ground, turning the
surroundings into an ice sheet.

I glided down on the ice mass lightly. Nearly falling at one point, I
kicked off the ice mass and landed on the race track.

With his gym clothes burnt inside the ice mass, Pierre was encased as if
time had stopped.

Beyond that, Ian, who had been chasing Pierre, was catching his breath.

A beeping sound came from my racket and Pierre’s racket within the ice
mass. We were disqualified for using spells that exceeded 2 stars.

‘This is quite…’

It ended more easily than I thought. I expected a fierce fight with
Pierre.

I never expected Ian to be such a wildcard.

Ian passed by the ice mass, looked at me with a solemn nod, and then
gave me a thumbs up.

“Isaac, your determination has been properly conveyed! I’ll definitely
come back in 1st place!”

“Uh… yeah. Fight on.”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but I gave him a thumbs up in
response anyway.

Like a determined shounen protagonist, Ian Fairytale dashed off again
along the race track.

His running speed was so fast that it kicked up dust and whipped up the
wind.

Suddenly, I saw faculty members flying towards us. It seemed they were
coming to fetch Pierre and I after our disqualification.

“Isaac and Pierre Flanche, after a heated battle, have been
disqualified! Ian Fairytale, who joined forces with Isaac, carries on
the will of his self-sacrificed comrade and dashes forward fiercely!!”

Amy’s voice and the cheers of the students echoed throughout the
academy.

Amy seemed completely absorbed in the commentary, adding all sorts of
odd footnotes.

It was then.

A cracking sound came from the direction of the ice mass. Scratches
appeared on the ice mass.

***I haven’t released the ice yet…?***

Pierre’s mana surged within the ice mass. The ice mass cracked
repeatedly, and streams of water spurted out from its fissures.

“…!”

I reflexively dodged to the side, avoiding the water jet that shot out
like a blade.

The water jet, squeezing through the narrow cracks created by the
splitting ice mass, extended like a thin sword strike, scraping the
ground.

Soon, the ice mass burst apart.

*Boom!*

Before the ice fragments scattered in all directions, I quickly
converted them into ice mana to prevent injury in consideration of the
approaching faculty members.

At the same time, a massive amount of water burst forth around Pierre,
like a dam breaking and causing a flood, forming a tsunami.

*Whoosh!!*

“Whoa!”

There was nowhere to escape. I conjured the defensive 4-star ice spell
\[Ice Wall\], and was swept away along with the ice wall by the surging
water mana.

The wave engulfed me. Thanks to \[Ice Wall\], I was spared from the
impact, but I had to swim through the water unexpectedly for a while.

Pierre’s water magic quickly subsided into the ground.

I pushed off the ground and lifted my head straight up. Water droplets
dripped from my soaking wet body.

On the race track, after shattering the ice mass and crashing down, a
soaked Pierre propped himself up on the ground, coughing violently and
continuously spitting out blood.

His body was not in a good condition because he had taken my \[Frost
Explosion\] head-on.

“Pierre! Are you alright…?!”

As the faculty members approached, Pierre suddenly deployed four magic
circles around himself.

A strong mana, filled with lethal intent, spread out. The faculty
members hesitated for a moment and then swallowed nervously.

Their position as faculty members was just a role after all.

Being human, they couldn’t help but feel fear towards a person who
ranked higher in the food chain than them.

“Pierre Flanche has been disqualified, yet he is deploying magic circles
towards Isaac! This shouldn’t be happening?!”

Amy reported the situation.

It was an unexpected situation. I thought he was the most compliant with
Alice’s words, and among the paladins, he was considered the most
lenient.

He must know that fighting here openly would be a violation of academy
rules.

“Pierre, retract your magic circles immediately!”

“You could potentially be suspended! Calm down! Fighting Isaac here will
result in disciplinary action!”

The faculty members desperately tried to dissuade Pierre, but his magic
circles were still emitting bright colors.

Pierre lifted his head.

The moment I saw his eyes, I guessed that it was futile to entertain any
further thoughts.

His eyes, seemingly void of emotion, were fixed on me.

He was filled with the intention to harm me.

<span id="0185_187_The_Grand_Festival_8.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 187: The Grand Festival (8)
===================================

**༺ The Grand Festival (8) ༻**

I threw my racket aside.

Standing up, I stuck the ground with Zhonya’s Staff.

The tip of Zhonya’s Staff carved a clear ice crystal shape. It gradually
grew in size until it was clearly marked on the ground.

Soon, a cold wind enveloped the area.

“…This is self-defense.”

Three light-blue magic circles unfolded. At the same time, I began
calculating the formula for the 6-star ice spell \[Frost Wave\].

This was to counter the Clover Paladin.

A drop of cold sweat trickled down my cheek.

I had no intention of getting hurt here. During the Grand Festival, I
had to defeat Miya and the shadow demon in order to gain EXP.

“Student Isaac?!”

“Are you crazy?! Stop it!!”

“Didn’t I tell you to calm down?!”

“If you don’t stop right now, I will resort to force!”

Faculty members also deployed magic circles or drew their weapons.

However, they couldn’t hide their nervousness, knowing Pierre and I were
far stronger than them.

In fact, they were more like hindrances than actual combatants.

I gazed at Pierre with a faint smile on my lips.

“I told you to calm down, what do you think you’re doing? Don’t tell me
I got you worked up?”

“…”

Pierre didn’t respond. Thoughts of killing me ran rampant in his head.

Of course, he wasn’t acting solely on impulse. There were rational
judgments in his behavior as well.

The four Paladins suspected me of being the Nameless Hero.

It must be Alice who made them suspect me.

Thus, they usually hesitate to provoke me.

But if I tried to hide my power in front of the entire academy, I would
inevitably fall prey to the Clover Paladin.

Comparing our mana, it was obvious who would win between Pierre and I in
a fight. For me to win, I would be forced to unleash my “hidden power”.

So, this was his judgment.

Suppose I was the Nameless Hero and, in this situation, I hid my power
and ended up severely injured.

Even if I recovered through healing magic, I’d still be bedridden
throughout the Grand Festival.

Being in the hospital would mean more eyes on me, restricting my
movements.

Especially during the Grand Festival, when the shadow demon was expected
to show up, the Nameless Hero would need to act. Alice and the four
Paladins likely knew about this.

Using the hospital’s eyes would be a great way to reveal my identity.

Yet, recovering at a dramatic rate and gaining freedom would also be
problematic. It would deepen their suspicions.

And now, Pierre had found the perfect excuse to attack me.

He could say that his motive for attacking me had nothing to do with him
being a Paladin. A motive that the entire academy would find plausible.

With the rumors of an informant in the academy circulating, such an
excuse would be very handy.

In other words, he was willing to sacrifice himself to provide Alice
with useful information.

So, assuming that a fight was inevitable, I conjured a magic circle.

“You’re Senior Isaac, right…? I’ll speak gently, so listen up.”

Pierre stretched his arms out in front of him.

“I’m going to try to kill you. Try to dodge it.”

After saying this, Pierre conjured a water elemental magic circle on the
ground.

A large magic circle drew a trajectory. My feet were within the range of
the magic circle.

‘Bastard…’

There was no way I wouldn’t recognize the form of this magic circle.

It was the 6-star water elemental magic \[Flying Whale\].

It was the spell that Luce had used during the end-of-semester
evaluation in the first semester of our first year, devastating the
surroundings. It was a magic where a mass of water in the shape of a
whale bursts out, within which flows a powerful current strong enough to
shatter buildings.

If I were caught in the \[Flying Whale\] conjured with his mana and
rage, even someone like me would have to brace myself for death.

The only way to counter was to run away quickly or freeze the \[Flying
Whale\] with a stronger power to prevent it from bursting out. But
neither of those methods was accessible to me at the moment.

If I tried to run, he would immediately cast \[Flying Whale\].

And I didn’t think my skills would be enough to freeze the water mana in
that raging current.

“I’m warning you! Withdraw your magic circle immediately!!”

“Pierre! I told you to stop!!”

Several faculty members casted \[Ice Spear\], \[Rock Avalanche\],
\[Fireball\] and deliberately missed Pierre. They were warning shots.
For the administrative faculty who had just come to collect the
disqualified students, that was the best they could do.

However, Pierre didn’t care. He only found it annoying. He stared at me
with lifeless eyes, focusing solely on me.

I unleashed the magic circle for the 6-star ice spell \[Frost Wave\].

I planned to counter \[Flying Whale\] to some extent with \[Frost Wave\]
while pulling up rock pillars from the ground to escape.

The rock pillars would be shattered immediately, but by pulling up
several all at once, I thought I could somehow manage to escape.‘

I had no choice but to try, otherwise I’d die.

I focused.

As the blue magic circle emitted intense light from the ground, I
activated my ice spell.

At that moment.

A crisp, clear sound rang through my ears.

An enormous amount of mana descended before me.

*Whooong!*

“Ahh!”

The ground gave way in an instant, and I lost my footing. I nearly fell
but managed to maintain my balance by leaning on Zhonya’s Staff.

Between Pierre and me, an unnaturally strong gravitational force seemed
to have descended, preventing \[Flying Whale\] from fully manifesting.

At the same time, a thunderous roar filled the sky. Due to me putting my
entire focus on Pierre, I hadn’t noticed the dark clouds gathering in
the clear sky. It was a thundercloud, and purple lightning split the
sky.

Within the storm clouds, a silhouette of a giant black grouse appeared.
The magic beast disappeared along with the thunder and lightning.

One after another, red winds rushed in like a typhoon. Countless sharp
winds, like a blade, cut through the air.

*Ching!*

Surrounding Pierre, a myriad of colorful starlight magic circles
unfurled, aiming at him from all directions. Encircled, he frowned and
scanned his surroundings.

Three female students had gathered around him, their arms outstretched
and their magic circles deployed.

“…”

Dorothy Heartnova, a student with light purple hair wearing a witch hat
rode on the starlight magic. She remained silent.

“Who are you going to kill…?”

Luce Eltania, a girl with rose gold hair wrapped in purple lightning
mana. Her lifeless, dull eyes and murderous voice were directed at
Pierre.

“Kill who? What nonsense.”

Kaya Astrea, with her green pigtail hair fluttering in the blood-red
wind, tilted her head and let out a scornful laugh worthy of a villain.

Subsequently, some of the most powerful forces among the dispatched
Imperial Knights, including some teachers with excellent combat
abilities like Professor Philip Meltron, appeared all at once and
surrounded Pierre. There were about ten of them.

They had all come to stop us before the situation escalated
uncontrollably.

I was taken aback at first, but I was eventually in awe.

“Baby.”

I felt a soft and plump touch on my back.

A gentle voice tickled my ear and I reflexively turned my back and saw a
gold-haired girl.

Alice Carroll. There she was, closely behind me, lightly touching my
arm.

She had her usual friendly smile on her face.

“Why don’t you stop before you get yourself in more trouble?”

“Senior Alice…?”

With these guys here, not just me, but Pierre too, wouldn’t have a
chance to react.

As I withdrew my magic circle, Alice murmured in my ear with a melting
voice, ‘That’s right, good boy.’ Her soft hand smoothly slid down from
my arm.

“Hey, Friend.”

Hearing Dorothy’s voice, I turned my head towards her.

Even though she was smiling, her voice was more subdued than usual. She
wasn’t talking to me but to Pierre.

The brim of her witch’s hat casted a dark veil over her eyes. The air
was heavy due to the oppressing mana emanating from her.

“Stop it. If you mess with that kid, I’m not sure what I’d do to you.”

Pierre frowned and turned his gaze towards me.

Though it seemed like he was looking at me, he was actually making eye
contact with Alice, who was hugging me from behind.

Alice was resting her chin on my shoulder. I couldn’t see her
expression, but it was probably not a good one.

Pierre sighed deeply, closed his eyes, and withdrew his magic circle.

Pierre’s mana was Grade S. Causing trouble meant the academy would have
no choice but to put him under special supervision.

Therefore, when Pierre acted unpredictably, the academy took immediate
action.

There was no issue for Dorothy and Kaya to be here since they were
officially involved in protecting the academy. I didn’t know about Luce
though.

Soon after, with his usual handsome smile, Pierre raised both of his
hands in surrender.

“I’m sorry. I surrender. I lost my reason for a moment…”

\[Wrathful Tail Strike!\]

“Kugh!”

Bello, the small killer whale familiar, which had been summoned at some
point, lashed its tail at the back of Pierre’s head.

*Thwack!*

There was a dull thud as Pierre’s head jerked forward from the impact.

***That must have hurt.***

\[I don’t know who you are, but if you mess with Isaac, this valiant
killer whale, Bello, won’t let you off easy!\]

Bello shouted in the voice of a young boy.

***He sure is reliable.***

With earnest acting skills, Pierre looked at Bello and chuckled softly,
‘Haha,’ showing a kind smile. Now that his plan had failed, he knew
better than to draw further attention to himself.

“Uh, oh, ugh…!”

Amy’s panicked voice echoed throughout the academy.

“Yes! Somehow the situation has been resolved!! The disqualified
players, Isaac and Pierre Flanche, please exit quietly!!”

Unable to let go of her enthusiasm for hosting, Amy shouted a warning in
the midst of it all.

Pierre’s wrists were handcuffed together after his rash behavior. They
were special magic tools designed to disrupt mana circulation.

On the other hand, no action was taken against me. It was clear to
anyone that I had only deployed magic circles to protect myself from
Pierre.

Surrounded by faculty, we left the racetrack.

<span id="0186_188_Priestess_of_The_Red_Lotus_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 188: Priestess of The Red Lotus (1)
===========================================

**༺ Priestess of The Red Lotus (1) ༻**

“Isaac, do you intend to work things out with Pierre…?”

“Absolutely not. I would like to see such a heinous attempted murderer
promptly put behind bars.

“That… you’re unexpectedly calm and resolute.”

The incident merely became a part of the festival’s aftermath.

Pierre Flanche, the center of the incident, was led away with a gentle
smile on his face.

His statement about wanting to kill me was heard by Dorothy, Luce, Kaya,
and several faculty members on the scene.

The faculty members pressed him on why he made such a statement.

He responded with an apology for letting his emotions get the best of
him and speaking harshly… He said he thought that I, the senior, would
have handled it better.

‘Make a believable excuse at least.”

According to my \[Psychological Insight\], Pierre was resentful.

His plan to provoke me had failed, and his impulsive emotional actions
came to nothing.

He must have thought that cornering me would make me reveal my hidden
power.

‘But this is the extent of my power.’

Pierre’s thoughts were complicated. It was uncertain whether this
incident would lessen the suspicions against me.

Then, I remembered the sight of Dorothy, Kaya, and Luce growling. They
had arrived at the scene with terrifying speed.

They had flown in as soon as Pierre unleashed his 6-star spell. With my
current capabilities, I wouldn’t have stood a chance against Pierre’s
\[Flying Whale\].

Not to mention, they all seemed angry. As if they were more sensitive to
the hostility directed at me than to themselves.

I was touched, and my heart was filled with comfort.

His statement was concluded swiftly.

With almost the entire academy as witnesses, the investigation focused
more on the conflict between Pierre and I than on the incident itself.
Of course, there was no connection between us, so the interrogation was
pretty short.

During the statement-taking, the first Arc Ball race came to an end.

Lisetta Lionheart’s team took first place, and our team secured second.

Pierre Flanche’s team also qualified for the next game, but it was
unlikely that the incident that I feared would reoccur.

‘Since Pierre was in custody.’

Pierre Flanche had been sent to the Academy’s detention center. This
place confined and controlled the students who had caused trouble or
were difficult to control and was now jointly managed by the academy and
the Imperial Court.

Avoiding severe disciplinary action would be challenging. This was the
answer I got after secretly asking a faculty member. Of course, he also
mentioned that we would only know the details after the statement was
taken and established the facts.

At least, Pierre wouldn’t be participating in the Arc Ball races during
the Grand Festival, so in a way, my goal was completed.

After cooperating with the investigation, I left the detention center.

The academy was still buzzing with a festive mood. The incident was just
an incident, after all. However, Pierre’s incident would be a hot topic
among students for a while.

“Isaac!”

As if she had been waiting, an alluring voice tickled my ears.

By the wall of the academy’s detention center, a female student with
rose-gold hair, Luce Eltania, greeted me. She pulled away from the wall
and hurried towards me.

“Luce?”

“Are you okay?”

Luce sniffed, her eyes checking to see if there was anything wrong with
my body.

“I’m fine. Thanks for earlier. What about the others?”

“They all went back.”

Dorothy had to return as the face of her department’s year.

Kaya probably left because she didn’t want to openly reveal our
relationship in front of the entire academy.

But why was this girl here? She was supposed to be with her team as the
face of the second year of the Magic Department.

“You? Is it okay for you to be here? You’re the representative…”

“Isaac comes first.”

Her response was indifferent yet firm. It was a touching answer, but… I
was planning to head back soon anyway.

In times like this, I thought it would be better if she fulfilled her
own role.

I felt bad thinking about the students, who were supposed to take care
of Luce, frantically searching for her by now.

“You’re not hurt. I’m glad you’re safe.”

Luce pulled away from me, genuinely relieved.

I smiled, grateful for the concern.

“Thank you for worrying about me. Let’s go back, Luce.”

“Okay, don’t stray too far from me.”

“…You don’t have to hold onto my sleeve. I’m not a child.”

“I’m still worried about you… Even if you’ve gotten stronger. If you’re
going to get in trouble like that, stay close to me.”

“I’ve never been in trouble, though?”

Luce glared at me. She was probably referring to the incident with the
Clover Paladin, Pierre, where I was nearly caught up in his magic.

Well, the fact that I didn’t get hurt was just a matter of outcome. If
no one had intervened, I might have faced the worst possible outcome. I
would have fought back in my own way, but it likely wouldn’t have led to
a good outcome.

By the way, she wasn’t using any restraints… unlike during social
situations.

Looking at how she wasn’t being reckless in this situation, it seemed
like Luce had also grown significantly.

“Isaac, I have something to ask.”

“What is it?”

“Who is that guy?”

Luce’s voice was sharp. Her tone was calm and cynical.

There was no one else she could be referring to as ‘that guy’ other than
Pierre.

“I’ve never seen a trace of him on you. He just tried to get revenge on
you for what happened during the race… right?”

***Sharp. To dig into that part immediately.***

“Probably, I’ve never even spoken to him.”

“Is that why he tried to use a 6-star spell on you? Threatening to kill
you?”

Luce’s voice dropped to a whisper.

“Perhaps.”

“…Okay.”

A short response. Her voice was subdued. I couldn’t see her expression
because she was leading the way, holding onto my sleeve, but I could
clearly read her psychology.

It was filled with murderous intent.

It wasn’t that she was going to go and kill Pierre right away. Luce
wasn’t someone who would commit murder indiscriminately.

However, it seemed clear she intended to keep a close eye on Pierre. If
he tried anything against me, Luce was ready to end him at a moment’s
notice.

That time was rapidly approaching.

***When the academy’s administration temporarily grinds to a halt…***

***…At that time, I will have to deal with Alice.***

“Hey, Isaac.”

“Yeah?”

“If something bad happens to you…”

Without looking at me, Luce laced her fingers through mine inside my
sleeve.

“…I’d probably… feel like the world is falling apart.”

Her words sounded like a warning.

I could feel the slender yet firm touch of Luce’s fingers. The ring on
her finger sparkled with a jet-black sheen.

\* \* \*

“Why did you do that?”

Alice’s labyrinth, a space decorated with a red and black checkered
pattern.

Pierre Flanche was sitting, restrained against a wall amidst luxurious
red furniture.

The Heart Paladin, a girl with short red hair, Shera Hectorica, leaned
in to question him. However, Pierre avoided answering with his usual
friendly smile.

“Be. Cause. Of. You. I. Thought. My. Heart. Would. Drop. You. Fool.”

Shera repeatedly pushed Pierre’s forehead with her fingers with a
dissatisfied expression. His head jerked helplessly.

Looking remorseful, Pierre offered an apology with a coy smile.

“I’m sorry.”

“Ah! You say you’re sorry and that’s it? Is that really all you can do?
You’ve caused trouble for the Kingdom, you…! Captain! Can’t you do
something about him? He’s caused trouble for us and the Queen!”

Shera asked the Spade Paladin, who was leaning against the wall with his
arms crossed, his head bowed deeply. He looked troubled.

The intelligent-looking male student, the Spade Paladin, sighed deeply
and walked over to Pierre.

His footsteps gradually quickened. Then he grabbed the handle of a chair
in his path and kicked it to pieces.

The chair shattered. The Spade Paladin continued to walk toward Pierre,
still holding the handle.

He swung at Pierre violently.

*Thwack*!

“Gack!”

“Kyaa!”

Shera staggered back, horrified.

Alexa, the Diamond Paladin, who had been watching Pierre from a
distance, looked at the Spade Paladin with curious eyes.

“Woah… that scared me, Captain!! If you’re going to hit his face, give
me a heads-up!”

Shera stomped her foot on the ground, but the Spade Paladin paid her no
mind and swung the handle on Pierre’s head once more.

A thud echoed as Pierre’s head snapped to the side. It didn’t actually
physically hurt him, as the room was only a mental space, but the impact
was clearly felt.

This place was a labyrinth that invited the psyche. It was a realm
independent of \[Basic Protection Magic\] that usually shielded one’s
body.

The shock experienced here was converted into psychological damage. The
injuries on Pierre’s face would eat away at his mind.

Behind the Spade Paladin’s glasses, his cold dark blue eyes shone.

“The first time, it was forgivable. Alexa’s foolish act could be
overlooked once, as it wasn’t a fatal mistake. But… to attempt murder
after witnessing her idiotic act is completely unacceptable. Moreover,
it wasn’t a plan we discussed. It was solely your own decision… Do you
have no self-control?”

“I’m sor— ack!”

*Thwack!*

“Where’s your rational judgment?”

*Thwack!*

“Did it satisfy you to mess things up with your emotions?”

*Thwack!*

“We’re doing this shitty student act for the sake of the Kingdom, to
repay the Queen’s favor, and for us to live. So what the hell are you
doing?”

Pierre hung his head low, his psyche form’s lips burst open, dripping
with blood.

The Spade Paladin threw the chair’s handle to the side.

“Our goal is to stop the Black Monster. To reveal its identity and
neutralize it. In the meantime, you look like you’re going to be
severely punished. You’ve even forgotten why the Queen called for us.”

The Spade Paladin crouched down, glaring at Pierre.

“Damned fool… Even so, I cherish you. When ‘that day’ comes, I will come
for you. By then, you must make up for this mistake.”

“…I understand.”

Pierre replied weakly, his voice choked with blood.

\*\*\*

The Priestess Miya became strange.

To the Nine-tailed Fox, Mae, Miya had always been a curious master. She
was a girl who proudly proclaimed her ambitions and cheerfully trampled
on others.

But lately, she had been nothing but quiet. It was very unlike her
master.

Ever since the Student Council President, Alice Carroll, whispered in
her ear.

Miya’s heart suddenly turned darker than ever, and she lost her usual
talkativeness as if she had become a different person.

She couldn’t figure out why. From the moment Alice started talking,
Miya’s mana supply was cut off, making it impossible for her to maintain
her form. It felt like a thick black fog had rolled in, creating a wall
between her master and herself.

And after being summoned again, Miya had changed like this. When I asked
her what happened, she simply dismissed it, saying, ‘Nothing happened.’

Miya stood quietly by the audience entrance, looking at the stadium. Her
lifeless eyes remained the same.

There have been only a few moments in recent years when she had been
wide-eyed and animated

It was during the Arc Ball race, when Pierre Flanche, her classmate, and
her senior, Isaac, confronted each other.

However, after Pierre was taken away, she couldn’t hide her
disappointment.

“…”

Miya watched the Arc Ball race participants cross the stadium.

Her gaze lingered on White. Miya frowned at White’s restless demeanor,
worrying about Isaac.

“Idiots.”

\[Miya…?\]

It was the worried voice of the Nine-tailed Fox, Mae. The familiar was
embedded in the form of mana inside the fingernail of Miya’s index
finger.

Miya quickly turned around and exited through the audience entrance.

“…Mae, store your mana in all your tails.”

\[For what reason?\]

Crossing the hallway, Miya thought of Isaac, the silver-blue-haired boy,
causing her to tremble.

“There’s something I need to deal with soon.”

<span id="0187_189_The_Priestess_of_The_Red_Lotus_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 189: The Priestess of The Red Lotus (2)
===============================================

**༺ The Priestess of The Red Lotus (2) ༻**

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 118!\]

Many female students submitted petitions to the academy.

To mitigate the clear wrongdoing of Pierre Flanche, they presented all
kinds of examples of his good deeds and asked for leniency.

They said Pierre wasn’t like that, that he was a person of excellent
character and kindness, and that there must be some kind of
misunderstanding.

‘Is this the life of a fucking alpha male.’

I had seen it on TV. There was a case abroad where a heinous criminal
was reported in the media, and a throng of people emerged protesting for
his release just because he was good-looking.

Could Pierre be such a case?

There were a few foolish juniors who directed their resentment at me,
but they stopped bothering me after receiving Luce’s murderous glare. At
times like these, there was no one as reliable as Luce.

After the Pierre incident, the Grand Festival proceeded smoothly.

Our team took first place in the Arcball race.

On the last day of the Grand Festival, the Arcball race award ceremony
was held.

The vain blond noble, Tristan Humphrey, stepped forward as the
representative for our team and raised the first-place trophy with both
hands, and our team cheered unanimously.

The first-place prize radiated vivid colors of mana and was engraved in
the air, existing only as a formless shape. It was scheduled to be
awarded after the conclusion of the Grand Festival.

I mocked Lisetta by saying, ‘Defeat is nothing to be ashamed of,’ she
furrowed her brow and gritted her teeth, muttering, ‘This bastard…’

Whether the moment of taking first place was purely joyful or not, I
seemed to be in an elevated mood as well.

Contrary to concerns, the Arcball race proved to be a valuable
experience. As soon as we won first place, my level rose from 117, which
I had reached during the preparation period for the Grand Festival, to
118. It was a satisfying outcome.

If there was something to lament…

‘I didn’t really enjoy anything else.’

As I walked around the campus, there were all sorts of things laid out.
Although there were many games and snacks ambitiously prepared by the
students, I didn’t really enjoy anything other than the Arcball race.

Even when Dorothy whined wanting to play together, I had to patiently
bear it.

Because I had to train.

My condition wasn’t poor, and the training ground was empty because it
was the festival period. It was truly a mouth-watering situation.

I wanted to master 7-star magic as soon as possible.

That was why I decided to be satisfied with just enjoying the festival
atmosphere. I had no intention of taking it easy.

Even if I feel regret now, I guess I should put off comfortably enjoying
festivals or anything else until after defeating Nephid the Evil God.

Before I knew it, a deep blue darkness had crept across the sky.

I left the training ground staggering as usual. I slowly made my way to
the closing ceremony.

I deliberately did not carry any magic tools since my body needed to
stabilize for a while.

After calming my breath for two minutes, I was able to walk normally.

***Now, let’s go.***

The campus was deserted. The entire student body would have been at the
stadium as it flaunted its splendid lights. I headed straight there.

Perhaps because my training focused on complex calculations and mana
manipulation, the mana expended was minimal. My physical strength could
be easily recovered with just a little rest.

Even amidst the tough training, I conserved my mana and physical energy
for the imminent event.

‘Act 8…’

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 8, Chapter 2, The Priestess of the Red
Lotus」.

During the closing ceremony of the Grand Festival, the last act has
Priestess Miya stepping onto the stage.

She captivated the students with the traditional Dance of Fire of the
Land of the Fire Blossoms.

However, the moment the dance ended, she suddenly went berserk, shooting
flames at several people.

To Ian, it was to settle a grudge from a duel, and to others, it was
because she resented them for speaking ill of her behind her back.

As she spectacularly lost control in front of all the students, the
player, watching the cutscene, couldn’t help but be shocked.

Fortunately, the combat troops affiliated with the academy were
positioned around the auditorium and quickly erected a barrier to
protect the students, but Miya soon fled.

And some people testified that just before Miya escaped, they saw a
demon in her shadow.

Thus, the academy went into emergency mode, concluding that Miya had
been possessed by a demon.

The academy then set out to find Miya.

Miya, hiding around the academy, knocked people down and attempted to
kill those she resented.

Ian Fairytale, driven by a sense of duty to defeat the demons with his
light element and sense of justice to protect the students, summoned his
friends.

Thus, the player had to form a party of four, including Ian, to chase
after Miya, who was under the control of a demon.

They had to stop her before the damage spread.

That was the content of Act 8, Chapter 2.

‘I don’t know if it will go according to the scenario.’

The variable ‘me’ already had a tremendous influence on the existing
scenario. Thus, the memory of the game was only for reference.

I didn’t know if Miya would go berserk during the closing ceremony or
not. However, it was necessary to be cautious and be on standby.

While walking, a white bird flew towards me, squawking, ‘Kwek, Kwek!’ It
was ‘V’, a letter courier often used for urgent matters, a magic beast
with a gentle nature that didn’t harm humans.

I paused and extended my arm. V landed on my arm and, with its long
beak, pulled out a letter from the bag it was carrying and handed it to
me.

“Thank you.”

As soon as V flew away, I checked the envelope.

A black letter with only the recipient’s name on it. There was no seal
stamped on it. It looked suspicious from any angle, but I didn’t feel
any suspicious mana.

“Eden.”

Rock mana gathered in the air, forming the shape of Eden, a small golem
familiar.

\[Kyuuu!\]

“Open this for me.”

As I gave him the letter, Eden quickly took it with his short arms.

Eden, being made of rock, was immune to poison. Even if something were
to spring out of the letter, I could simply just unsummon him.

Eden opened the letter with his adorable rocky hands and took out the
contents.

\[Kyuuu!\]

Eden handed me the letter. It was an ordinary piece of paper with only
writing on it.

I took the letter from him and read the contents.

Although the sender wasn’t written, I could immediately tell who sent
it.

“Indeed, it’s different from the scenario…”

\[Kyuuu.\]

I didn’t even dare to expect things to go as I thought they would.

As expected, Act 8, Chapter 2, was heading in a different direction than
originally planned.

\* \* \*

A scene in contrast with the night sky took over a corner of Märchen
Academy. It was a brilliantly shining stadium.

Students in uniforms occupied the stands. Everyone was visibly excited.

“Now, let’s begin the closing ceremony of Märchen Academy’s Jeblem
Festival!”

The announcer Amy Holloway shouted. Fireworks loudly burst into the air,
marking the start of The Grand festival’s closing ceremony.

Amidst the splendid performance on stage and the students’ enjoyment…

Luce was solely waiting for Isaac, Dorothy was excitedly responding to
the performance, and Kaya was nervously swallowing her saliva.

Eventually, the closing ceremony performance reached its final sequence.

A beautiful girl with black hair gracefully made her way onto the stage.

Her red dress was adorned with dangling gold ornaments.

Mana flowed around her like ocean water, enriching the stage.

The Priestess stood alone at the center of the stage, readying herself
for the performance.

With elegant poise, her delicate body boasted graceful lines. Soon, as
the orchestra’s music weaved beautiful melodies, Miya unfolded her black
fan with flair.

In the brilliant illumination of mana lights, she displayed a dance of
great dignity.

Her dance, an offering to the gods, was truly artistic. The students,
utterly absorbed in the music, were mesmerized by Priestess Miya’s
dance.

As the performance reached its climax, Miya’s flames spectacularly burst
forth in sync with the timing.

The undulating red flames spread like silk, elegantly slicing through
the air, perfectly harmonizing with Miya’s movements.

This was the tradition of Horan, Land of the Fire blossoms, the Dance of
Fire.

The students watching Miya’s dance were either spellbound with their
mouths agape, lost in a trance, or smiling in admiration.

Watching this, Dorothy quickly furrowed her brow in a stern expression.

“Huh, Dorothy?”

“That’s… a fake.”

“What is?”

“…I’ll be right back.”

“Huh? Where are you going, Dorothy?!”

Without responding to her friend, Dorothy left the stands and climbed up
the stairs.

\* \* \*

Dozens of minutes earlier.

With the noisy closing ceremony behind, Märchen Academy was submerged in
quietness.

There were hardly any people around the campus. After all, the students
were all watching the closing ceremony.

A student with silver-blue hair left the campus grounds and arrived at a
nearby outdoor dueling ground. It was quieter than anywhere else,
despite the ongoing festival.

With not a single lamp, the place drenched in darkness was illuminated
by nothing but the feeble light of the moon and stars.

The dueling ground had a structure that extended downwards. Isaac, after
passing through the passage, stopped in front of the stairs leading
down.

He lowered his head, taking in the sight of a woman in a red dress,
adorned with ornate decorations, standing in the middle of the training
ground.

She sensed someone’s presence and turned her head. As befits the star of
the closing ceremony, her beautifully made-up face, sharp eyes, and
lifeless pupils were now directed at Isaac.

“You’ve come, Senior.”

The silence of the dueling ground was broken.

She spoke in a prickly tone while gathering her black hair.

It was the Priestess, Miya.

Isaac descended the stairs without a word. He took off his jacket and
tossed it aside in the stands, then loosened his tie by pulling on it.

His demeanor revealed he had quickly guessed the reason Miya had called
him here. Miya let out a laugh at that.

On the dueling ground, Isaac stopped walking, keeping a distance from
Miya.

“You came alone. I like that you’re obedient.”

“You’ve been watching me all along.”

Isaac took off his glasses and spoke in a calm tone. His gaze had turned
cold.

He had strategized with Kaya and Dorothy for the scenario of Act 8,
Chapter 2. However, immediately after receiving a letter from Miya,
Isaac guessed that all their plans had turned to dust.

The letter contained a childish self-made drama.

It demanded that Isaac come alone to the outdoor training ground at
night, claiming they had White. There was also a warning that things
would not end well if he tried anything foolish.

Immediately after reading the letter, Isaac scanned the area with
\[Clairvoyance\]. He realized that a watcher minion made of flames was
watching him from afar.

He didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t follow the letter’s
instructions. If he had attempted ‘anything foolishness’, Miya would
surely have noticed, potentially causing her to do something that Isaac
couldn’t predict.

However… within the range of what could be predicted, Isaac wasn’t
particularly concerned.

Rather, he was thankful that Miya hadn’t caused a commotion and had
simply called him out alone.

“Your insight is sharp. Quite impressive for an insect.”

“You don’t actually have White, do you?”

Using \[Clairvoyance\], Isaac had confirmed that White was watching the
closing ceremony.

Miya, not fully aware of Isaac’s abilities, had underestimated him.

“Sorry for lying. But you knew that was a lie and came anyway, didn’t
you?”

Isaac nodded his head.

After finishing a light stretch, Isaac glared at Miya.

“…Do you resent me?”

“Do you not want to kill an insect that bites you, Senior?”

“I see how you’re treating me.”

There was nothing more to say.

Isaac amplified the circulation intensity of his mana circuit. Clenching
his fists, he assumed a battle stance with an indifferent expression,
grasping coldness in his hands.

Miya smirked. Flames wrapped around her, and three tails of fire rose
up.

In her shadow, a demon’s eyes flashed.

The moment they had been waiting for was drawing near.

<span id="0188_190_The_Priestess_of_The_Red_Lotus_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 190: The Priestess of The Red Lotus (3)
===============================================

**༺ The Priestess of The Red Lotus (3) ༻**

‘Hilde, try to sneak out and get Kaya.’

\[What are you planning? You can not win against that woman with your
current power, can you?\]

‘I’m going to win. And listen carefully to what I’m about to say.’

\*\*\*

\[…Understood. You must survive, Master. When I return, I will give you
a full taste of my affection.\]

‘I don’t need it.’

\[…!\]

I gave orders to Hilde, who was hiding as a small form of mana in my
collar.

Miya’s watcher minion disappeared as soon as I reached the outdoor
dueling ground, so there shouldn’t be any problem with Hilde moving
around.

The one I should be the most wary of, the Phantom Cat Cheshire, was
probably engrossed in the heat of the closing ceremony by now.

The key was to send out Hilde without being detected by the Priestess
Miya.

I steadied my breathing and prepared for battle.

Unlike the last duel, Miya didn’t let her guard down and unleashed the
power of the Nine-tailed Fox from the start.

With her having unleashed the fox’s power, I couldn’t win on my own. The
differences in combat experience, physical abilities, and even clever
tactics were all meaningless in the face of the overwhelming gap in
power.

‘Three tails…’

That wasn’t her full power, not by a long shot.

Her tails stored a considerable amount of mana and enhanced the output
of magic.

Meaning, the more tails she revealed, the stronger Miya became.

When the ninth tail appeared, that was when her full power was truly
shown.

‘Planning to pressure me gradually, huh?’

It was a rather vicious strategy. She wasn’t satisfied with simply
unleashing all nine tails at once.

Currently, a shadow demon was lurking within Miya’s shadow. Unbeknownst
to her, it snuck in.

While it was fused in the shadows and unable to do anything for now, if
Miya unleashed the full power of the Nine-tailed Fox, it would devour
her power.

Then, I would become a Demon-Limited Hunter, able to annihilate both
Miya and the demon at once.

Therefore, I should give Miya a motive to bring out all nine tails.

I would have to withstand her attacks, counterattack, and escalate this
fight.

‘Not bad at all.’

Foolishly, I felt a sense of excitement.

This was a great opportunity to gain real combat experience.

A life-and-death battle was far more nourishing than a hundred duels.

Every experience like this was incredibly valuable on my journey to
defeat the Evil God.

*Crackle!*

Miya swirled flames with her black fan.

It was time to settle things with this tiresome kid.

\*\*\*

*Bang!*

*Crackle!!*

“Are you just going to keep running away, Senior? Try to make me look
like a fool like you did back then!”

In the outdoor dueling ground, where only the two of them stood, Miya’s
red flames drove away the black darkness.

Miya, having partially unleashed the power of the Nine-tailed Fox,
spread powerful flames in all directions, maintaining the spell
\[Firestorm\] around herself at all times.

Though this should rapidly deplete her mana, Miya had more than enough
mana to not worry about its consumption.

Isaac sprinted around the ground, countering using ice and rock magic.

He leaped out of the dueling ground and into the stands, avoiding Miya’s
flames. He was as nimble as a squirrel.

Before long, his right hand was clutching Zhonya’s Staff, which he’d
pulled out from his magic pouch.

The mana stone, infused with the natural mana of dawn, was imbued with
ice magic. He executed high-level mana mastery in an instant.

A powerful ice spell countered Miya’s flames. Red and pale blue colors
painted the night scenery.

*Boom!*

The flames were neutralized.

Isaac and Miya glared at each other through the rising white steam.

“You’ve gotten stronger? Your mana has become more refined.”

Miya gathered her flames.

To her senses, Isaac’s mana was denser than it was during their last
duel.

Even with three of her fox tails unleashed, at this rate, she would not
be able to defeat her silver-blue-haired senior.

While she had the advantage in sheer mana quantity, Isaac possessed
additional abilities that could bridge that gap.

After pushing back some of her anger, Miya regained her rationality.
Which told her…

Isaac, that man, was a genius.

He was simply a late bloomer with his talents.

‘Or perhaps.’

That man could be the Nameless Hero.

In other words, he could be slowly revealing his true strength while
pretending to grow. If there was a reason to conceal his power, what
better excuse than ‘growth’ to ease the restrictions of his actions?

Although it was an unwelcome hypothesis, it was also an undeniable
possibility.

The idea that the man she wanted to devote her body and soul to could be
such a fraud was so absurd that she involuntarily let out a scoff.

Miya glared at Isaac, convinced that such a possibility was false.

“I’ve been thinking…”

In Miya’s hand, the tip of her luxurious black fan flickered with flames
like a bonfire.

Behind her, three tails of flame waved gently, casting a soft glow.

“I hated you. I thought I’d make you pay for humiliating me during our
duel. But after calming down and thinking it over… it turns out you seem
quite useful, like a decent piece of trash.”

“What are you trying to say?”

Isaac asked, clearing his throat, and Miya covered her mouth with the
flaming black fan.

Her eyes twinkled with mischief.

“Become my subordinate.”

“What are you saying…?”

“If you join me, I can promise you wealth and honor. I swear as the
Priestess of the Land of the Fire Blossoms, Horan. That’s quite a
tempting offer for a lowlife like you, isn’t it?”

“Haa.”

He sighed deeply.

Isaac sat down in the stands right behind him and slung Zhonya’s Staff
over his shoulder.

Even without the hints from \[Psychological Insight\], deciphering
Miya’s intentions was fairly simple.

“Hey, I’m late in asking, but what about the closing ceremony? What are
you doing here?”

“You really are late in asking.”

Miya turned her head toward the stadium.

Far from the academy grounds, she couldn’t hear the music of the closing
ceremony. But she could feel the festive atmosphere through her skin.

A chuckle escaped Miya’s lips.

“My clone will take care of it.”

“Is that your familiar’s ability?”

“You know well. Yes, Mae is proficient in all sorts of magic.”

“Must be convenient when you’re substituting.”

“Senior… aren’t you a bit too relaxed? Why don’t you worry about
yourself instead of the closing ceremony?”

The fact that the Priestess of Horan commands the Nine-tailed Fox, Mae,
was widely known across the world.

One of the fox’s abilities was to create clones. Miya, its master, could
also use this ability to create a clone of herself.

Though it wouldn’t be able to communicate, the clone would be able to
dance at the closing ceremony.

“So let me get this straight if I become your underling, I get wealth
and honor… right?”

“Looks like you get it. See, I rule over the East. Once I say something,
I mean it… On one condition.”

“And what is that?”

Miya chuckled and extended three fingers of her right hand.

“Three fingers. The index, middle, and thumb should suffice. With these,
I’ll forgive all your impudent actions and promise you a life of wealth.

“…”

“It’s quite generous for messing with me. Just three fingers to appease
my anger and serve under the grace of the most beautiful woman in the
world for the rest of your life… Where else would you find such a
ludicrous offer?”

Miya had no intention of actually messing with Isaac’s fingers.

Though she coveted Isaac’s talent for her ambitions, her anger and
disdain had already accumulated too much.

If she ever had the opportunity to sever his fingers, she’d do it
slowly, joint by joint, and, pretending it was an accident, she’d cut
off his wrist along with them.

Every time he screamed in pain, she would feel a chill of pleasure. It
would surely soothe her rage to some extent.

“What do you think?”

“Hmm.”

Isaac lifted his head, feigning contemplation, then calmly raised his
middle finger to Miya.

“Fufu.”

Miya let out a chilly laugh and intensified the flames from her black
fan.

The flames surged powerfully.

*Whaaaack!!*

Miya waved her fan and the flames rushed towards Isaac with fierce
intensity. Isaac sprung to the side, dodging the \[Firestorm\], and
countered with numerous spells.

\[Ice Spear\], \[Frostfire\], \[Frost Explosion\], \[Rock Avalanche\]…
All the elemental magic failed to penetrate the flames surrounding Miya
and were consumed.

The flames were dense with mana.

It was as if an intangible force created a defense mechanism with the
sole purpose of protecting her like a dense sand wall.

However, the Priestess Miya was also unable to pressure her opponent.
The strength of three tails was not enough. As it was, it would only
turn into a battle of endurance.

She doubled her firepower.

Miya pulled out three more tails. Six flickering flame tails, resembling
a fox’s tail.

As the tails increased, Miya’s magic grew in power and temperature.

It was no longer just a burning flame. It shattered and swept away
everything.

*Crackle!*

*Boooom!*

“Senior! If I can’t have what I want, I have the urge to destroy it! The
more you resist, the worse things will be for you! Just come with me
peacefully, huh?!”

“…”

Isaac remained impassive. Not a trace of bewilderment on his face.

His cold gaze, which contrasted with his usual gentle eyes, was scanning
the situation. If his opponent was stronger than him, he would simply
adapt his response.

Isaac skillfully handled Miya’s flames. He thoroughly understood her
attack patterns, as if he had fought her countless times before.

With his exceptional physical abilities, Isaac navigated the stands, his
movements gradually restricted by the threatening \[Firestorm\] swirling
and barricading around Miya.

The flames that almost reached him were somehow neutralized by powerful
ice magic.

“Really… Is that all? You dared to confront me with such mediocre
skills?!”

Miya was filled with mixed emotions.

She glared so hard that veins bulged out on her forehead. She released
her seventh tail, cackling.

“Kugh!”

Even without direct contact with the fire magic, Isaac could feel his
skin burning and sizzling.

Isaac spread the chill that enveloped his body even more intensely to
ease the burns.

“Kehe, how amusing.”

Miya tracked the scruffy man as he continued to flee through the cloud
of dirt and pungent smoke.

A stark difference in mana. It was clear that she, who was imbued with
the power of the Nine-tailed Fox, was much stronger than her
silver-blue-haired senior.

Yet, Isaac was somehow bridging that gap with his exceptional combat
sense and observational skills.

Such talent was rare to find.

Miya, a tyrant who had used her position as a Priestess ruling over
Horan, and looked down upon her people and violently took advantage of
them, knew this all too well.

Wizards were very expensive.

This place was Märchen Academy, where talented individuals gathered, so
it was not uncommon to find people skilled in magic.

Outside, simply wielding 6-star magic could earn a commoner noble-like
status.

Moreover, wizards who could wield 7-star magic or higher would demand
higher prices.

Then what about this man?

He had already mastered 6-star magic and possessed physical abilities
that were uncharacteristic of an aspiring wizard.

Plus, he showed exceptional combat sense that pressured Miya during
their last duel.

With such capabilities, it wouldn’t be long before he’d be capable of
wielding 7-star magic. His potential was unimaginable.

‘I want him.’

He was a remarkable talent.

Especially if having this man also meant gaining the overwhelmingly
talented Luce Eltania.

Therefore, she had to have Isaac by any means necessary.

***Fine, let’s see who is superior.***

***I’ll prove to you that I’m far mightier than you’ll ever be. I’ll let
you feel the full extent of my power.***

***I am the woman who will dominate this world. A Divine Priestess who
will rule as the sole monarch.***

***This lowly academy is merely a stepping stone on that journey.***

***So beg for my forgiveness and come under my wing.***

***Even if you don’t want to that doesn’t matter to me. I’ll stick to my
ways.***

***I’ll take someone dear to you as a hostage.***

***Gouge their eyes out, skin them, or cut off their limb, and then
you’ll surely grovel and beg on your own.***

***Beg me to take you as my subordinate, admitting your mistakes.***

***That is the future awaiting you if you refuse to heed my offer,
Isaac.***

Miya thought to herself as she relentlessly unleashed her fire magic at
Isaac.

“Eden!”

\[Kyuu!\]

The rock golem familiar, Eden, appeared around Isaac.

Eden, clad in rock armor to increase his battle prowess, created a rock
shield in Isaac’s hand.

He leapt through the stands and charged toward Miya. He aimed his
enlarged fist at her.

From another direction, Isaac jumped forward with the rock shield,
simultaneously wrapping his body in intense cold and releasing
\[Frostfire\].

The \[Frostfire\] swirled together with the \[Firestorm\], momentarily
creating a cloud of steam.

Meanwhile, ice magic condensed around Zhonya’s Staff, followed by a pale
blue magic circle.

It was the formula for the 5-star ice spell, \[Frost Explosion\].

Isaac intended to protect himself from the flames using the rock shield
while casting \[Frost Explosion\].

“Hehe! Is that all you’ve got?”

A reckless choice.

Miya unleashed her eighth tail. Red flames erupted from her like steam,
engulfing Isaac and Eden.

*Paaaa!!*

“Kugh!”

Isaac crouched and hid behind the rock shield, but the violent flames
sent him flying like a ball.

\[Frost Explosion\] was activated, only to be consumed by the scorching
flames, rendering it ineffective.

Eden was also helplessly pushed back by the flames and crashed into the
stands alongside his master.

The stands shattered with a loud crash, and dust rose into the air. Eden
grunted and groaned as flames that could even melt his rock body
surrounded him.

At that moment, there was a dagger slithering across the dueling grounds
towards Miya.

*Swoosh!*

However, the dagger was helplessly deflected by \[Flame Pillar\] which
erupted from the ground.

“Trying that trick again… Don’t you get tired of it?”

Isaac, along with Eden, distracted Miya by secretly throwing the Sheath
of Disaster.

Having been tricked by it before, Miya saw right through it.

The magic circle engraved on the Sheath of Disaster emitted a pale blue
light and flew into the stands. The glow quickly faded.

Isaac tossed the hot rock shield aside. It rolled across the ground with
a clatter and soon dispersed into brown mana in the air.

He swung his arm to clear the dust and stood up. His uniform was
scorched. His silver-blue hair was covered in dust.

He wiped the blood that trickled down his forehead.

Through his hair, his frosty red eyes, filled with determination, were
solely focused on Miya.

Calm and steady.

‘That’s the spirit.’

Miya looked at him like an enticing ripe fruit on a tree.

If she took one bite, the juices would surely burst out.

He possessed great potential and wasn’t intimidated by opponents whose
power overwhelmingly surpassed his own. He focused his will and stared
down his enemy.

It was a remarkable spirit. Indeed, she wanted him.

“Senior, what will you do…?”

Isaac held out the Zhonya’s Staff. The mana stone emitted light.

*Gooooo…*

Miya swiftly raised her head as she felt heavy mana above her head.

A pale blue magic circle had been unleashed within the \[Firestorm\].
Amidst the chaos, Isaac had taken time to calculate the deployment
formula for 6-star ice magic.

The \[Frostfire\] was engulfed by the \[Firestorm\] and it interrupted
the formation of the magic circle.

Miya was so focused on the Sheath of Disaster that she failed to realize
Isaac’s final move.

Something had burst forth beneath the magic circle. It was a
dangerous-looking pale blue sphere.

By the time Miya saw it, the spell had already been activated.

*Whaaaaaa!!!*

Miya’s eyes widened.

It was the 6-star ice spell, \[Frost Glitter\].

Dense, thick spikes rained down like a shower. Even the \[Flamestorm\],
imbued with the power of the Nine-tailed Fox, couldn’t block this
attack.

“…Hehe.”

However, Miya soon smirked.

The final tail of the Nine-tailed Fox sprang out, instantly forming a
powerful defense system.

Fire magic burst from the ground in multiple streams, spiraling outward.
It happened in the blink of an eye.

The air heated up intensely.

The flames swirled and gathered.

Soon, it erupted in a burst of flames.

*Boooooom!!*

The pillars of flame surged up like beams of light with ferocious
momentum, pushing away the \[Frost Glitter\] and devouring the sphere of
dense magic.

It was the 6-star fire spell, \[Explosive Wave\].

A tremendous explosion of steam shattered the stands.

Isaac hastily deployed a wall of ice imbued with rock magic,
\[Fossilized Ice\], but the aftermath of the explosion shattered it away
and sent him flying.

“Ugh!!”

Isaac was hurled at tremendous speed to the edge of the dueling ground.
Isaac grumbled as he crashed into a wall, making it crumble.

It felt like his bones were broken. Even with \[Basic Protection
Magic\], he was helpless against such an impact. Luckily, he didn’t pass
out.

His strength drained away. He gritted his teeth and forced himself to
exert power throughout his body.

A terrifying pressure of mana crushed Isaac. The difference in power was
now incomparable.

He lifted his head.

The \[Flamestorm\] that filled the dueling ground had turned into a
gentle breeze of flower petals. It was the 7-star fire spell, \[Cherry
Blossom\].

Touching even one of these petals could cause an explosion far beyond
anything the \[Firestorm\] could produce. No matter how much defense
magic he used, he had to be prepared for his body to be blown away.

Within the \[Cherry Blossom\].

Under the night sky, in the middle of the dueling ground.

There was a girl with nine tails of flames wrapped around her.

Her hair turned red, it was shaped like flames, blazing at the tips.

Her red eyes glowed with a holy aura.

She was the Master and Divine Maiden of the Eastern Nation, the
Priestess of the Red Lotus.

The tyrant of the East; who would not be satisfied if she didn’t get
what she desired.

“I’ll give you another chance. No… this is an order.”

The Priestess who unleashed the full power of the Nine-tailed Fox spoke.

“Join me. Be my subordinate and beg. If you are still unwilling, even
with promises of wealth and honor, I will have no choice but to use
violence. Wouldn’t that be sad?”

“…Such as?”

Blood trickled from Isaac’s mouth. His voice was laced with blood.

“I’ll harm someone dear to you.”

“Why…?”

“You made it quite obvious you care deeply, almost sickeningly so. You
came at me with fury in your eyes over a hurt worthless bitch. If I were
to harm someone far more precious to you than Princess Snow White… what
kind of reaction would I see from you?”

Miya’s smiling face suddenly hardened.

“I might just gouge out your mother’s eyes. And if that doesn’t make you
want to serve me, next, I’ll skin her. And if you still won’t listen…”

“Don’t… talk… nonsense…”

*Flop.*

Isaac’s voice trailed off.

He closed his eyes and collapsed limply to the side.

Miya was momentarily startled but felt a thrill at having said her
piece.

“Huhu, it’s too boring if you pass out now. The fun has just—”

Miya was about to approach Isaac.

But then.

Behind her, a pitch-black darkness crept up from the ground like an
assassin.

There was no mana emanating from it. Miya was slow to realize because
there was no presence.

Startled, she quickly turned her head.

\[Give me that power.\]

The dark figure opened its jaws wide and swallowed Miya whole.

“Kugh…!”

Miya clutched her head in agony as her body and mana were gradually
engulfed by the dark mana.

From within her shadow, a human head with three pairs of eyes and three
mouths carved like triangles sneered wickedly.

\[Miya! Miya!! Ugh, what’s with this guy?!\]

The Nine-tailed Fox’s desperate cries echoed through the dueling ground
but soon lost her voice.

The nine tails that were wrapped around Miya’s body were all dyed a deep
black.

The color of the 7-star fire spell, \[Cherry Blossom\], that surrounded
her also transformed from a beautiful and brilliant red to a void.

The shadow demon let out a strange howl and finally absorbed Miya’s
power completely.

From Miya’s face, where black mana smoke seeped out, three pairs of eyes
took their places.

Miya was flung sideways by the demon and rolled across the ground.

The demon that had drained Miya’s power looked down at her with a smile
full of satisfaction.

“Demon…!”

Miya frowned grimly and tried to wield fire magic, but nothing came out,
leaving her in shock.

It was the moment of the shadow demon’s triumph.

“…”

Isaac cracked open one eye to witness the scene. He pretended to be
unconscious.

His field of vision was clear. It was obvious since he fell down at a
calculated angle.

In 「Act 8, Scene 2, Priestess of the Red Lotus」 of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, Miya finally revealed her full power by unleashing all nine
tails of the fox.

And so, the demon hiding within her shadow revealed itself.

It was the final boss of Act 8, the Shadow Demon.

\[Elmetona the Ethereal\] **Lv:** 180

**Race:** Demon

**Elements:** Dark, Fire

**Danger:** Highest

**Psychology:** \[Pleased with successfully stealing the power of the
Priestess and the Nine-tailed Fox.\]

‘She’s out.’

「Act 8, Scene 3, The Shadow Priestess」.

We have reached the final chapter of Act 8.

\[Finally, you’ve unleashed your full power…\]

“Kugh!”

Elmetona the Ethereal grabbed Miya’s throat and lifted her up.

Miya struggled, gripping Elmetona’s arm in agony. Despite her attempts
to kick at the dark figure that looked exactly like her, it was futile.

Her eyes rolled back as she choked, tears and saliva streaming down her
face.

Without the ability to wield fire magic, Miya was just a powerless girl.

If the source of her power died, Elmetona would lose what little power
she gained, so she couldn’t kill Miya.

However, the demon only intended to show Miya who was superior.

\[Waiting was hard.\]

*Whack!*

“Ugh…!”

Elmetona punched Miya in the face as she choked her.

\[I’m exhausted. I almost killed myself because I was impatient. I
almost ended my own life. I’m dumb. I’m foolish. I’m pathetic. But I
took it away. I took this power away…! But I loathe myself…! I’m
idiotic! I’m miserable! I deserve to die!!\]

“Ku, kughh…!”

*Slap!*

*Thud!*

*Whack!*

*Thud!*

*Crack!*

Elmetona slapped Miya’s face repeatedly as she rapidly spat out words.

She slammed her knee into Miya’s abdomen and broke Miya’s leg with a
kick.

“Kughhhh…!!”

Miya couldn’t move because she was being choked. She couldn’t even turn
her head. She could only gasp for air as she received the blows.

Her once beautiful face was now a hideous bloody mess.

The shadow demon, Elmetona the Ethereal, was sinister and deeply
self-loathing. She was constantly muttering self-deprecating remarks.

If any creature looked at her, she would tear them apart because she
thought they were disrespecting her. She had extremely low self-esteem.

‘That was very hard…’

Elmetona wouldn’t kill Miya. Instead, she intended to preserve her as
the source of her power.

Since it had come to this, she might as well take a beating.

Elmetona did not stop her one-sided violence. Before Miya could choke to
death, she released her throat, then grabbed her arm and repeatedly
kicked her like a punching bag.

It was the process of creating a hierarchy.

She would instill fear in Miya, the true owner of the power, by
assaulting her every day.

It was a daily process of exploiting her strength.

Isaac slowly got to his feet.

The debris clinging to his body fell, clinking softly against the
ground.

\[…?\]

The Shadow Priestess, Elmetona, released Miya’s arm as she gasped,
‘Kugh…’

With a thud, Miya’s body collapsed to the ground. Her face was swollen
with bruises, her joints were twisted, and her clothes were filthy. She
was a complete mess, like a tattered rag.

*Crunch.*

Elmetona stepped on Miya and glared at Isaac with three pairs of eyes.

\[What’s with that look? Are you calling me an idiot, pathetic,
disgusting, pitiful? Are you looking down on me?!\]

*Crack, crack.*

“Ack, aaak…”

Elmetona repeatedly stomped on Miya in anger. The blows shattered her
bones, even the ones that were still intact.

Unable to think rationally in the excruciating pain, Miya eventually
lost consciousness due to the pain.

That should be enough.

Isaac grabbed his shoulder and lightly stretched his neck, then he spat
out a mouthful of blood.

His cold, red eyes scanned the demon.

Meanwhile.

At the stadium where the closing ceremony was taking place.

A small, firefly-like figure approached Kaya Astrea and whispered into
her mind.

It was Hilde.

The familiar conveyed Isaac’s instructions to Kaya.

“Sir Isaac…”

Kaya’s expression hardened, and she stood up from her seat and made her
way through the aisle behind her.

She was about to leave when Dorothy, who had the power of \[All in the
World\], noticed that the dancing Priestess was a fake.

*Goooooo.*

Unmatched, heavy mana descended upon the stadium.

Time seemed to stand still for a moment, as the noisy closing ceremony
fell into a sudden hush.

Dorothy’s eyes widened and she froze. She wrapped herself in starlight
mana and floated up.

With shocked expressions, Luce and the Paladins turned their heads
toward the enormous surge of mana.

Seated at the top, Alice closed her eyes to gather her thoughts.

Beside her, Phantom Cat Cheshire flashed a strange smile. As if it knew
what was coming.

The faculty and Imperial Knights scrambled to assess the situation.

In an instant, the festival grounds were filled with chaos and murmurs.

Everyone there realized one clear fact.

The Great Archwizard.

The Nameless Hero had appeared.

Chapter 191: The Priestess of The Red Lotus (4)
===============================================

**༺ The Priestess of The Red Lotus (4) ༻**

The Nine-tailed Fox, Mae.

In the Nation of the Land of the Fire Blossoms, where Miya ruled like a
tyrant, the reason she was not easily assassinated was largely due to
the significance of her magic beast.

Once upon a time, the Nine-tailed Fox had transformed into a poisonous
stone that took the lives of anyone who approached her.

The reason for this was her deeply rooted distrust in humans due to
almost having been killed by them. The Nine-Tailed Fox had thus
transformed itself into a cursed rock that poisoned every approaching
living being.

The forest with the poisonous stone was known as the Forest of Death,
deserted and off-limits.

And so, the Nine-tailed Fox had to live alone, in solitude, for
countless years.

Then one day, a curious young girl, came to the Forest of Death.

Born into a poor family, her appearance was humble, but her intelligent
eyes and beautiful black hair were very pretty.

She was later known to be a girl named Miya.

The girl possessed a mysterious power.

Enough to recognize the lonely emotions and the long-dulled sadness of
the fox magic beast that had become a poisonous stone.

Braving death, Miya approached the Nine-tailed Fox, which had
transformed into a poisonous stone, without hesitation, even though she
was poisoned by the strong toxin.

She constantly healed herself to prevent herself from perishing, gently
caressing the rock.

─ ‘It’s okay, it’s okay…’

Her voice and touch, like sunlight splitting through a canopy of trees,
illuminated the dark forest.

The young girl named Miya, barely keeping herself alive and having
already poisoned, continuously stroked the rock with her hands, now
faded in color.

Before Miya collapsed, the Nine-tailed Fox released her transformation
and revealed her true form.

The pure white Nine-tailed Fox shed tears as she was caressed by Miya’s
touch.

Miya smiled broadly, exclaimed how beautiful it was, and then hugged the
Nine-tailed Fox.

The Nine-tailed Fox laid down her hostility towards the young child.

Miya often visited the Forest of Death to meet the Nine-tailed Fox and
shared her everyday stories.

Happiness was the fulfillment of absence. That was what the Nine-tailed
Fox realized after meeting Miya.

Her loneliness had disappeared with happiness being rooted in its place.

Miya gave the Nine-tailed Fox such genuine happiness that even the
trauma of nearly being killed by a hunting party soon faded away.

However, at some point, Miya stopped visiting the forest.

The Nine-tailed Fox waited for Miya.

Every day, she waited only for Miya’s return.

Rain poured.

Snow fell.

Yet, It stood in a spot where she could immediately meet Miya if she
came, like a dog waiting for its master, the Nine-tailed Fox simply
passed the time quietly.

Then, after a long time had passed, on a day when the white snowflakes
had thickly covered the forest,

Miya came back, but by then, she was no longer the kind little child the
Nine-tailed Fox knew.

─ ‘Follow me. I will show you the world I will rule.’

The girl was adorned in glamorous clothes and expensive-looking jewelry.

There stood a tyrant, ready to commit cruel acts without hesitation to
get what she wanted.

\*\*\*

“You dare to touch my mother?”

Mana surged.

My body became as light as a feather, and my stamina was not only
restored but increased to the point of it being never-ending.

My mana circuit became incredibly robust. The density and amount of mana
flowing within were pumped with a terrifying force.

Sensing an ominous aura, the Shadow Priestess Elmetona the Ethereal
instinctively decided that she must protect Miya, the source of her
power.

Elmetona layered a sturdy black flame protective shield over Miya.

*Whoosh!!*

An extremely cold chill burst from Isaac, driving away the flame blossom
spell \[Cherry Blossom\], turning the surroundings into a frigid ice
field.

A heavy force of suffocating mana settled down. That alone almost made
Elmetona stagger.

The unique trait \[Hunter\] activated.

Dramatic enhancement of the body and mana.

Isaac’s mana had grown so powerful that it not only pressed down upon
this island but also extended its force over the sky and the surrounding
seas.

***It’s only a matter of time before people flock here.***

***However… it won’t take long to take down that demon.***

Isaac stretched his right arm to the side.

*Whoosh.*

Dark blue mana gathered in his right hand before expanding and then
condensing into a singular point. Isaac stretched out his arm and
clenched the mana with his hand as a scythe took form and snugly fit
within his grasp. The sounds of chains resounded throughout the dueling
ground.

It was the Frostscythe, a legendary weapon wielded by the Primordial Ice
Sovereign.

“There’s one thing you’ve overlooked.”

As Isaac narrowly opened his eyes, his skin’s hue intensified and his
silver hair bristled.

Then, a deep aura symbolizing the Primordial Sovereign gently flowed out
from Isaac.

The 9-star passive skill, \[Ice Sovereign\].

Elmetona the Ethereal, upon sensing that aura, couldn’t keep her mouth
shut. It was evidence of having reached the pinnacle of a single
element.

Isaac, lifting the Frost Scythe, said in a scornful tone:

“I don’t have a mother, Bitch.”

Pale blue mana flowed from his red eyes, a harbinger of newly acquired
magic.

He slammed the end of the Frostscythe into the ground.

A clear, ringing sound echoed.

From that point, a clear chill spread in all directions, enveloping the
entire dueling ground.

With a cracking sound, layers of vivid ice walls rose from the ground,
constructing a wide space.

「Domain Expansion」

The cold transformed the ground into a massive floe and made the world
its canvas.

A pale blue magic circle was engraved on the beautifully sculpted ice
ceiling. Countless brinicles slowly extended downward, dripping with a
murderous chill.

Within that icy palace, the frosty wind bestowed a hellish cold to those
trapped unfortunate enough to be in its embrace.

\[Is this…?\]

Elmetona’s eyes widened in shock.

A strong sense of crisis rang like an alarm from within.

The being before her was an archwizard. No, something far more menacing.

Feeling his immeasurable power, Elmetona furrowed her three pairs of
eyes. Her face contorted hideously with revulsion.

This place was a freezer of the extreme where violence flowed. A
sinister palace of ice.

It was Isaac’s domain.

「Divine Sanctum of Blooming Frost」

*Whoosh!!*

The Nine-tailed Fox’s flames, strengthened by dark mana, exploded in a
fury following Elmetona’s rage.

Black flames scattered about. However, their power and extreme heat were
insufficient to melt the icy palace.

They barely managed to prevent her feet from freezing to the ground.

Elmetona clenched her fists tightly and trembled violently.

Before Isaac, a demonized being had no chance of victory. Thus, a
fire-like anger surged within Elmetona.

\[You insolent fool!!\]

Elmetona roared in rage with a bizarre voice.

Bright Red magic circles unfolded endlessly. Each circle unleashed
barrages of 5 and 6-star fire magic.

*Whoosh!!*

*Crash!!*

Massive explosions and black flames poured onto Isaac without ceasing,
filling the icy palace.

\[Hear me, you arrogant ice Wizard! How dare a human defy the natural
order?! Coveting the realm of Lord Nephid without knowing your place!\]

A shriek close to a wail.

\[Your very existence is a sin!\]

*Clash.*

*Whoosh!*

The coldness surrounding the space aggressively swirled, instantly
freezing the explosion itself. An unusual blue ice mass formed.

At that moment, Isaac lightly swung Frostscythe, and the ice masses
enveloping him crumbled away.

He was unscathed, just as he had been when first seen.

Elmetona was taken aback, not expecting her barrage to be so
effortlessly nullified. The laws of physics, which were seen as common
sense everywhere else, did not apply here.

Why had that man struggled against the Priestess just moments before?

***Why did he deceive her?***

***…I see. I understand.***

Elmetona guessed Isaac’s intentions.

He must have noticed Elmetona hiding in the Priestess’s shadow from the
start and lured her into revealing herself.

Had that man shown his true power from the beginning, Elmetona would
have simply gathered valuable information and waited for another
opportunity.

\[Ice Sovereign\] was but a secondary power to him. Revealing his
existence was sufficiently justifiable.

Look at that ice wizard.

Despite being a lowly human, he dared to rival her lord, the Evil God.

Elmetona, who had lived in shadows and darkness for eons, thought of the
Primordial Sovereigns.

They, too, were unmatched in their arrogance, but never on a level
comparable to the Evil God. No matter how strong, they knew to uphold
the laws of the world.

But this archwizard was different.

No, perhaps even the title of archwizard might be an understatement for
this silver-blue-haired man.

“It’s lukewarm.”

Even a high-density, high-temperature black flame barrage, capable of
easily sweeping through Märchen Academy, was nothing more than warming
oneself by a distant bonfire in front of Isaac’s frigidity.

He had already surpassed even the Primordial Sovereigns.

Isaac.

The name of a being stronger than any human Elmetona had ever seen.

Elmetona clenched her fists tightly.

Staying here would only result in freezing to death.

Even if she managed to withstand by emitting flames unrestrainedly, the
moment she touched the sharp icicles or brinicles that were gradually
descending, the worst cold imaginable would freeze her entire body,
leading to a bitter end

“…Now it’s my turn.”

Isaac’s red eyes, holding a pale blue glow, targeted the enemy.

*Whoosh!!*

Feeling a sense of urgency, Elmetona emitted black flames at maximum
output.

She had to escape somehow. If Isaac wished it, death would come in an
instant.

Moreover, the chill emitted by that man would surely lead to death upon
contact.

Elmetona overlaid dark mana on a 7-star fire spell, \[Void Phoenix\],
passed down from the Land of the Fire Blossoms.

Behind her, a large black magic circle unfolded, spewing black flames.
The flames of darkness danced splendidly, carving a path.

Along that path, a phoenix formed of black flames flew.

It was a flame concentrated with terrifying mana.

The phoenix contained the power to wipe out an entire region if it
touched the ground.

─────.

…It was utterly futile.

The black phoenix froze in its blazing glory.

A silvery continuous line was drawn in the very center, and it was cut
in half instantly.

\[What…!\]

\[Abyssal Glacier\]. A 7-star ice spell that froze things without
restriction.

The next move was Frostscythe’s unique magic, \[Absolute Zero\]. The
area carved out by the blade was severed beyond the limits of space with
extreme cold infiltrating the gap.

*Whisk!*

Isaac bypassed the bisected Phoenix and arrived at Elmetona.

His speed was as if he had never moved. It was as if he fooled the eyes
into thinking he was there the entire time.

Startled, Elmetona instinctively poured out black flames in resistance,
but…

*Slash!*

*Chalalak!*

As Isaac swung Frostscythe, a silver circle tinged with coldness swept
across the flames, drawing twice momentarily into the void.

Even the black flames were effortlessly severed along the Frostscythe’s
path, rendering them powerless. Consequently, Elmetona’s vision
distorted involuntarily.

It was because her body, sliced by the Frostscythe, had been divided
into three pieces.

The parts of her body cut by the Frostscythe’s blade immediately froze
to its unique magic.

The biting coldness tore through Elmetona.

\[Aaaah!!\]

She couldn’t give up like this.

She reminded herself.

Her goal was to eliminate Ian Fairytale, the only being capable of
killing the Evil God.

It was a greater cause.

If she couldn’t defeat him, she would have to leave the task to the next
of her kind.

And she was certain.

In fulfilling that cause, this silver-blue-haired man was an obstacle
akin to a giant mountain range.

Even a little would do. She had to inflict an irreversible injury on
this man, to make it easier for the next of her kind to kill Ian
Fairytale.

Elmetona let out a bizarre scream as she unfolded five black flame magic
circles.

*Boom!*

However, Elmetona’s hope was thwarted by a kick thrown with tremendous
speed by Isaac.

With a sound akin to an explosion, Elmetona’s body, now reduced to a
bust, was sent flying up to the ceiling.

Elmetona hit the ceiling of \[Divine Sanctum of Blooming Frost\]. The
brinicles shattered, scattering beautiful opalescent powder.

\[Ugh…!\]

The moment she touched the icicle, the extreme cold penetrated deep into
her entire body.

The pale blue magic circles filling the ceiling emitted a deadly light.
The coldness intensified.

Suddenly, the black flames enveloping Elmetona’s body extinguished, and
her body froze solid in an instant.

The bust of Elmetona now turned into an ice statue and fell downwards.

Isaac condensed ice mana in his right hand and stretched out his arm
towards the falling bust.

Frigid mana overflowed.

*Kwaaaaaaaa!!!*

A pale blue flash, faster than sound, momentarily lit up \[Divine
Sanctum of Blooming Frost\].

A loud noise followed in succession.

Numerous pieces of the frozen Elmetona scattered.

Rough ice masses soared above Isaac’s hand and stuck to the ceiling.

Isaac dissolved the ice mass and lowered his arm.

Within the \[Divine Sanctum of Blooming Frost\], his breath turned into
a white mist, flowing along with the cold wind.

The time it took to defeat Elmetona after activating his Domain
Expansion was just over 20 seconds.

Chapter 192: Priestess of The Red Lotus (5)
===========================================

**༺ Priestess of The Red Lotus (5) ༻**

“Look over there!”

Several faculty members and Imperial Knights hurried towards the
direction where the mana of the Nameless Hero had been felt.

One of the faculty spotted a magic beast crossing the night sky.

The rest of the group caught sight of the creature and their eyes
widened.

“The White Dragon…!”

“It has appeared, indeed.”

The beast flew into the night sky, exuding nobility.

Its white wings were permeated with opalescent frost.

Undoubtedly, it was the mythical White Dragon.

The very same familiar that the Nameless Hero rode when the Abyssal Sea
Monster emerged.

It was smaller than that time, possibly because its master hadn’t
summoned it in its full form.

Dorothy, who was flying away from the faculty members using starlight
mana, suddenly stopped and looked at the White Dragon.

The mystical creature made its way to a figure standing on the clock
tower and landed beside him.

The White Dragon’s cold mana briefly illuminated its master, standing
against the moonlight.

Everyone’s jaw dropped as they gazed at him.

He was over two meters tall. The man was clad in a robe that barely
contained his muscular physique.

Though details were hard to discern from a distance, the presence of the
White Dragon familiar was proof enough of his identity.

“The Nameless Hero…”

The mysterious archwizard who protected Märchen Academy.

He seemed to be scanning the academy, then quickly vanished beyond the
clock tower, along with the White Dragon.

“Damn it! Let’s split up here. We’re going after that man!”

“Right now?! The appearance of the Nameless Hero means that a demon
might be on the loose!”

“It’s probably over by now! I can’t feel any mana!”

The Nameless Hero’s mana had long since faded. That meant, that even if
the demons had appeared, they would have been quickly eliminated.

“Remember, one of our orders was to uncover the identity of the Nameless
Hero. Your academy should focus on understanding the situation.

“Ack! Wait a moment!”

A few Imperial Knights turned toward the clock tower, pursuing the
Nameless Hero.

The Nameless Hero was a powerful archwizard capable of destroying the
world. Even the Imperial Knights, experts in combat, were powerless
against him.

They needed to approach him with caution.

There was an air of impatience since they hadn’t been able to identify
him since they were dispatched to Märchen Academy.

By now, the hero was already far away. It would be difficult to catch up
to him.

The faculty continued in the direction that the Nameless Hero’s mana was
initially felt. They had to find out what had happened and make sure no
student was harmed.

Meanwhile.

“…”

Dorothy gazed at the top of the clock tower where the Nameless Hero had
been, then pressed her witch hat firmly to her head and flew back in the
direction she had come from.

Thanks to the power of \[All in the World\], it was very simple to guess
Isaac’s intentions.

It was Kaya Astrea, not Isaac, who had been standing on top of the clock
tower a moment ago.

It seemed that Isaac had given her a magic cloak of disguise to create
an alibi for himself.

And by sending his familiar, the White Dragon, he made people believe
that the disguised Kaya was the Nameless Hero.

He must have already planned an escape route. If it was Isaac, it was
guaranteed.

Dorothy’s mana was too high to be fooled by such an illusion. Therefore,
Isaac likely decided that it would be better to leave the robe to Kaya
by process of elimination.

“Uhh.”

She was worried that Isaac might have been injured.

Dorothy picked up her pace.

\*\*\*

In the dueling ground, far from the academy.

Dorothy had flown quickly to where she first felt Isaac’s formidable
power, and her eyes widened when she arrived.

In the center, Miya lay sprawled like a corpse, barely breathing. She
was covered in bruises. She looked like she was violently attacked by
someone.

A faint wisp of fire mana floated around her. It looked like Miya’s fire
elemental familiar was in a state of unconsciousness.

At the far end of the ground, against the wall, Isaac laid collapsed
amidst the debris.

It was unlikely that Isaac was responsible for what happened to Miya, as
he could only exert tremendous power when fighting against demons.

Therefore, it was certain that the Shadow Demon within Miya, which Isaac
had mentioned beforehand, was the one who had brought her to such a
state.

“Isaac!”

Dorothy knelt in front of Isaac. Worried, she called out to him, not as
‘President’, but by his name.

For some reason, Isaac was pretending to be unconscious despite being
fully awake.

However, Isaac was not in good condition. His uniform was scorched, with
visible burn marks. His right arm was completely charred, indicating
severe injuries to his body.

“Isaac, you…”

Dorothy looked down at Isaac in shock and helped him to his feet.

Slowly, he opened his eyes.

“Senior, I’m supposed to be unconscious…”

Though he was joking, Isaac was likely in considerable pain from the
burns. Despite trying to hide it, his cold sweat was undeniable.

Dorothy’s face was filled with sorrow. It was a stark contrast from her
usual playful demeanor.

She felt remorseful for not being at the scene until Isaac was in this
condition.

“Why did you push yourself so hard?”

“I didn’t really push myself—”

“Would you want to see me bloodied and burned?”

Swallowing back tears, Dorothy casted a healing spell on Isaac.

The fact that Isaac had been injured from overexerting himself caused
Dorothy gut-wrenching pain.

“Ah, uhm… I’m sorry.”

Isaac was taken aback by Dorothy’s seriousness.

Feeling guilty, he quickly apologized and briefly explained the
situation

He had already seen that the faculty was approaching using
\[Clairvoyance\]. As the sound of a group moving through the forest drew
near, he decided to postpone the details until later.

Soon, a dozen faculty members crossed the forest and reached the dueling
ground. They were momentarily surprised but quickly began to manage the
situation.

“We found the Priestess Miya and Isaac in the closed dueling ground with
signs of battle. I will shoot up a pillar, so please call the healing
team immediately.

The faculty who reported the situation shot a pillar of mana into the
sky using a magic tool.

While the mana density and power of the pillar were negligible, the
device effectively fulfilled its role by sending a visible signal
through the night sky.

“Dorothy, what happened here?”

“I don’t know. I just got here too.”

The faculty used healing magic on Isaac and Miya for emergency
treatment. Advanced healing magic would likely require a visit to the
academy’s hospital or a church.

Soon, the healing team arrived at the dueling ground, accompanied by
some members of the Imperial Knights. In between them were the Student
Council and its president, Alice Carroll.

The healing team prepared to transport Isaac and Miya on stretchers.
Meanwhile, Alice went straight to Isaac.

“Are you okay, Baby?”

“Senior Alice… Yeah, more or less.”

“Looks like you had a big fight?”

“More importantly, why did she end up like that…? She was fine before I
passed out.”

Isaac looked at Miya with a questioning expression, feigning innocence.

Alice shook her head.

“I don’t know. You should focus on getting treated for now.”

“…Okay.”

The healing team escorted Isaac to the carriage.

Alice and Dorothy quietly watched Isaac being taken away.

“You were quick to notice, Dorothy. You realized the Priestess at the
closing ceremony was a fake.”

“No.”

Her voice was subdued.

“I was late. I naturally assumed she was real, so it took me longer than
I would have liked to figure it out.”

When Dorothy saw Miya dancing at the closing ceremony, she hadn’t
initially planned to use \[All in the World\].

She just felt strange, so she looked at the Priestess, just in case.

It was only then that she realized that she was a hollow fake.

Isaac had previously mentioned that the Priestess might go berserk
during the closing ceremony. Considering that his prediction didn’t
align with what actually happened, it was clear that Isaac’s
expectations had been wrong.

Alice looked at Dorothy calmly. It was so different from her usual
cheerful and bright demeanor that it felt awkward.

Somehow, Alice found it amusing.

“You get pretty serious when it comes to my baby, don’t you? It doesn’t
suit you.”

“…I’ve been bothered by him for a while now.”

Dorothy glared at Alice.

“Why do you call Isaac, ‘Baby’?”

“Why does that bother you?”

“Because you don’t have the slightest affection for Isaac.”

“How do you know that?”

“I just do.”

Oddly enough, the only one Dorothy couldn’t read in the academy was
Alice. Even the power of the \[All in the World\] was meaningless in
front of her.

However, she could sense a dark veil shrouding Alice’s heart.

This was one of the reasons Dorothy hated Alice.

“Haha, you just know it… You really do hate me, don’t you?”

Alice turned towards Dorothy.

“I’m curious, what would you do if Baby became mine?”

Dorothy was momentarily taken aback, wondering if she had heard wrong.

Twirling her earring with her finger, Alice spoke playfully.

“You like Isaac, don’t you? It’s so obvious that I can’t help but
notice.”

“What…?”

“So, I’m wondering. If you, who openly dislikes me, were to find that my
baby truly likes me… I wonder how you’d react.”

Faced with such an obvious taunt, Dorothy chuckled with her usual sneer.

“…I’d kill you, Alice.”

Whenever it involved Isaac, Dorothy couldn’t help but react sensitively
to the provocation.

Alice Carroll. According to Isaac, she was someone he would have to
fight one day.

He hadn’t acted yet only because no concrete accusations had come to
light. Isaac had stressed the need to prepare for a fight with Alice.

Dorothy considered it fortunate that Alice was an enemy.

“That makes things interesting.”

Alice smirked.

The two most powerful female students of Märchen Academy glared at each
other with smiles on their faces.

Even without unleashing their mana, a dense aura of murderous intent
radiated from them, making the air heavy and startling the people
passing by.

It was then.

“Ah, ah…!”

In the middle of the dueling ground, Miya groaned in pain as she was
carried on a stretcher.

As soon as she regained consciousness, she felt like her whole body was
being ripped apart.

“Aaack!”

The healing team that was carrying her stopped in their tracks as she
started convulsing.

“Miya! Calm down…! Ack! Are you okay?!”

*Clang*.

Miya fell off the stretcher while making a ruckus.

Her bloodied body was clad in beautiful attire.

Miya scraped at the hard ground with her broken arm.

The healing team tried to calm Miya, who was flailing her broken limbs
in a frenzy.

Overwhelmed with emotion, she screamed at them to go away, lamenting her
fate in a desperate voice.

“What… what the…! I, I, why did I, become like this…! Why!!”

Her scream was close to a wail.

Her face was mixed with despair and rage. Bloody tears of frustration
rolled down her cheeks.

She seemed confused, not knowing where to direct her arrows of
resentment.

Dorothy and Alice, the Student Council, and the Imperial Knights simply
watched the seemingly insane Miya. The healing team, sweating profusely,
tried to calm her down.

“Wait.”

Isaac, lying in the carriage, propped himself up to look at Miya.

The sight of Miya, weeping with a voice choked with blood, was a stark
contrast to the pale moonlight above.

“Something’s wrong…! It’s strange! Why does this keep happening…? I
didn’t come to the academy for this!”

Isaac searched through his memories.

After clearing 「Act 8, Scene 2, The Shadow Priestess」 of ❰Magic Knight
of Märchen❱, when the Truth Investigation Committee was questioning
Miya.

She claimed she didn’t know why she went on a rampage during the closing
ceremony. It was as if she was a drunk who committed a crime, unable to
control her emotions.

Miya calling him out for a fight was a completely different scenario
from the original storyline.

Isaac couldn’t deny the overwhelming sense of urgency in the event.

Within the ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ community, there was a prevalent
theory that Miya’s uncontrolled behavior was caused by one of Elmetona
the Ethereal’s abilities.

However, witnessing Miya’s breakdown firsthand casted doubts on the
accuracy of that theory.

“I hate everything…! It’s all so annoying! Me, me!! Why do I have to end
up like this?! Something’s wrong…! Something fucking wrong!!”

*Crackle!*

After fainting, her mana seemed to have slightly recovered, as red
flames burst out from Miya.

“Kugh!”

“Huph!”

The healing team, who were trying to calm Miya down, were injured by the
flames and stumbled back.

Reflexively, the faculty drew their weapons, and the Imperial Knights
unsheathed their swords. Even if the opponent was wounded, they could
not refrain from using forceful measures.

Dorothy looked on with a wary gaze, Alice with a subtle smile, and Isaac
with a serious expression.

“What’s with you all…? Pathetic bastards, why are you looking at me like
that…? Stop staring at me…!”

Asserting her dominance. She showed contempt to them.

The desire to dominate the world. The need to keep outstanding talents
under her control.

All of it stemmed from Miya’s desire for recognition and her low
self-esteem.

She wanted to look like someone important.

She wanted to be seen as someone special.

The fear and embarrassment of being revealed as insignificant were too
overwhelming for her.

Because of that, she trusted no one and resorted to threats. For her, as
the tyrant of the East, terror, force, and immorality were her safety
net.

So the fact that she had been humiliated so many times at Märchen
Academy was unbelievable to her.

It was also very infuriating and painful.

“I am the Priestess of the Land of the Fire Blossoms, Horan! I am not
someone to be treated like this at this academy! But why…!! Why…!!”

Miya’s outcry dissipated into the night breeze.

The fox’s paw brushed over Miya’s hand, which had been scratching the
hard ground, almost breaking her nails.

When she lifted her head, she saw the Nine-tailed Fox as white as snow.
The fox resembled Miya’s red eye makeup, emitting a gentle flame.

The magic beast had regained its senses. The Nine-tailed Fox Mae; the
familiar that had accompanied Miya on her journey.

That fox looked at her master with a lonely gaze.

<span id="0191_193_Priestess_of_The_Red_Lotus_6.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 193: Priestess of The Red Lotus (6)
===========================================

**༺ Priestess of The Red Lotus (6) ༻**

\[Let’s stop now. You’re badly hurt.\]

“Fuck… who are you to order me around?”

Miya’s eyes were red due to the blood.

Miya, glaring at the Nine-tailed Fox with narrowed eyes, snorted in
derision before turning her arrows of resentment towards the magic
beast.

“Ah, right. It’s because of you. Useless fox. Can’t even protect your
master. This is why things always end up like this. What can you
actually do right? What were you doing until I ended up in this state?!”

\[…\]

“I thought you might be of some help when I made the contract, but you
turned out to be just another useless insect. Uwaahaha…! Hic… hic. Fuck…
Fuck!!”

When her power was taken by Elmetona the Ethereal, the Nine-tailed Fox
lost consciousness and was then taken over by the demon.

It was as if she had been asleep. It remembered nothing of what had
happened.

However, seeing Miya in tatters, it wasn’t hard to guess the
circumstances before and after.

Amidst the flames, Miya continued to shed bloody tears, repeatedly
cursing.

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae quietly watched her master fall apart, mulling
over a conversation it had with the young Miya in the forest of death.

─’What are you doing? You’re wearing a flower ring on your index finger…
Ah, Mae, this goes on the ringer finger. Wait, this is your hand,
right?’

─ ‘Eek, it’s your foot?!’

─ ‘Alright\~. It’s a flower ring from Miya. With this, we’ve become
friends!’

─ ‘Huh? A human and a magic beast being friends…? Why bother questioning
it? If we’re friends, we’re friends.’

─ ‘I really like it. Being able to be friends with such a pretty magic
beast.’

“What are you staring at, fucker? Aren’t you going back right now?”

She was such a lovely child.

The Nine-tailed Fox, overlaying past memories with Miya, continued in a
nostalgic voice.

\[I’m sorry. Blame me for my incompetence in failing to fulfill my
duties as a familiar. I’ll take my punishment later. Still, even so,
won’t you allow me to be by your side for now?\]

“What?”

\[You are my only friend. You saved me. In that quiet forest, you led
me, who was suffocating in loneliness, to a bright world.\]

The Nine-tailed Fox let out a wistful smile.

\[Miya, you are my light. I love you. So… give me the chance to share
that sorrow.\]

“…Pfft!”

Eventually, Miya burst into laughter as if she found it amusing.

It was a reaction the Nine-tailed Fox had not anticipated.

“‘Friend’? ‘Led me to a bright world’?”

Miya felt dizzy. Despite her physical condition being a mess, a surge of
exhilaration sharpened her senses.

A deep-seated malice and extreme excitement, as if filling her insides,
urged her on.

To immediately harm those who irritated her.

“What a load of nonsense.”

\[Miya…?\]

Isaac, sitting atop the escort carriage, steadied his breath.

***Is she about to reveal a truth she had been hiding?***

Miya let out a twisted smile. Her face was far from her usual beauty,
grotesquely swollen and full of blood.

With her head spinning, she thought.

Undeniably, she had entered into an exceptionally unfair familiar
contract with the Nine-tailed Fox, more so than with anyone else.

No matter how things turned out, the Nine-tailed Fox could not terminate
the contract with Miya at will, and the master’s orders were absolute.

Moreover, her status as the Priestess of the nation of the Land of the
Fire Blossoms wouldn’t change, as she had already firmly established
herself in that position.

The only one to be hurt emotionally was the incompetent familiar, the
Nine-tailed Fox, who couldn’t even protect her master.

Miya had been contemplating when to reveal the truth, all the while
immersed in anticipation of the Nine-tailed Fox’s eventual downfall.

In the end, the Nine-tailed Fox would follow Miya through despair and
regret. How entertaining would that be?

Intense anger and excitement, the ‘malice’ that Alice had shed, had
consumed Miya.

“Lean your ear towards me for a moment.”

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae leaned in, bringing its head close to Miya.

With a voice tinged with laughter, Miya revealed the truth.

“That… wasn’t me.”

The little kid who risked her life to show kindness to the Nine-tailed
Fox Mae.

The “True Priestess” Isaac wanted to protect in the first round but
ultimately failed to.

“It was my damn sister.”

Twin sister.

It was the real Miya.

\[…What are you talking about?\]

The Nine-tailed Fox seemed to have its thoughts frozen for a moment.

\[What do you mean, what are you talking about?\]

The black-haired girl in front of it was, without a doubt, the one who
had saved it.

With her extraordinary powers, there was no doubt in the fox’s mind that
she was her master.

But now, what was she talking about? The Nine-tailed Fox couldn’t
comprehend what she was talking about.

\[No… you’re Miya, aren’t you? There’s no need to deny yourself like
that…\]

“I’ve stolen everything my sister built up. You’re the same. You’re just
my property.” Said Miya. No, Miya’s sister.

“So, why did you so foolishly agree to such a damn idiotic familiar
contract? You moron. Tsk tsk.”

\[Miya…?\]

“Now shut your mouth. It’s an order.”

With a shocked expression, the Nine-tailed Fox got up.

Slightly parted lips, eyes wandering through the air.

No one heard the conversation between Miya’s sister and the Nine-tailed
Fox amidst the flames.

However, those who watched could definitely guess that a conversation
had taken place that had mentally shocked the Nine-tailed Fox.

Suddenly, the Nine-tailed Fox remembered a conversation it had with the
young Miya.

─ ‘I have an older sister. Mei, my sister. She’s articulate and
incredibly cool. I want to be like her someday.’

Miya’s sister. Her name was Mei.

After forming the familiar contract, it was reported that Mei had gone
missing from Miya’s side.

Was it actually Miya who had gone missing?

“Khhhh. Pathetic fox. Incompetent, unable to even protect its master…”

*Clatter!*

*Boom!*

“…?”

Chunks of ice extinguished the flames that had enveloped part of the
dueling ground.

A silver-blue-haired male student, Isaac, stood firmly in front of
Miya’s sister, Mei.

Dispelling her flames, which had already reached their limit, was an
easy task.

He peered down at Mei with his cynical red eyes. His gaze was so cold it
could chill the heart of anyone who saw it.

“Fuck, Senior? Why are you here? Trying to meddle again…?”

“Don’t you think it’s strange?”

Isaac knelt on one knee and grabbed Mei’s left wrist, lifting it.

As pain shot through, she groaned and made a face filled with disgust.

“You insect, how dare you touch my body…! Huh?”

Mei’s eyes widened in shock.

It was strange.

To form a contract with a magic beast of 8-stars or higher, a familiar
contract circle was needed.

The 8-star familiar contract circle Isaac had received from the Candy
House Witch was exactly that.

He had witnessed the familiar contract circle on her wrist activate when
Mei used the Nine-tailed Fox’s power.

That was why he grabbed her wrist, to remind her of this puzzling point.

“You’re clearly out of mana. So how do you think the Nine-tailed Fox is
out here in perfect condition?”

Demons awakened by the Evil God were all born with dangerous powers.

It just wasn’t always prominent because Isaac had been dealing with
demons as soon as they appeared.

However, consider demons such as Vera the Summoner and Elphelt the
Evanescent.

The former was born with the power to dominate any familiar, even those
who had made a contract with someone else.

The latter was born with the power to neutralize mana.

All of them were endowed with unbelievably incredible abilities.

How much more so for Elmetona the Ethereal, who had lived significantly
longer than them?

The demon stole both the Nine-tailed Fox and Mei’s mana.

Its ability was Complete Deprivation.

It first forcibly nullified the contract between Mei and the Nine-tailed
Fox, and then it was able to freely control the power of the Nine-tailed
Fox.

“Ah…”

Mei’s face turned pale with shock.

She felt it. The Nine-tailed Fox contract circle had already
disappeared. This was proof that her contract with the Nine-tailed Fox
had been annulled.

Only then did Mei realize the identity of the unease she had been
feeling.

She no longer felt connected to the Nine-tailed Fox.

It was as if they had become complete strangers to each other.

“Ah, aah…!”

She had to obtain whatever she wanted to be satisfied.

She had taken everything from her sister because she coveted everything
her sister had.

Mei’s face twisted. At first, there was shock, then a sense of being
wronged, followed by sadness, and finally, anger adorned her expression.

Not being able to have what she wanted…

…And the fact that what was hers had been taken away…

…Gave her a terrible sense of loss.

Finally, Isaac drove home the truth that Mei wanted to deny.

“For reasons unknown, your contract has been terminated. Your familiar
is now free.”

The memory of rummaging through trash cans for a piece of bread filled
Mei’s head.

Their damned parents had abandoned the twin daughters and ran away long
ago.

Mei was left alone with her sister. The daily hunger and the selfish
people who, despite living in wealth, didn’t share even a single piece
of bread and looked at them as if they were insects, were deeply
resented by Mei.

She recalled the memory of clutching a handful of sand on the beach.

Just like the beach where she could scoop up sand at will, Mei
desperately wished for immense wealth that she could freely gather.

To be free from poverty and have a status that bowed to no one was what
Mei fervently dreamed of.

And it was none other than her twin sister, Miya, who became the key to
that dream.

Her sister, born with the sacred flame, possessed the qualities of the
Priestess that the Nation of the Land of the Fire Blossoms had long
desired.

The Priestess was selected through a process. Only by passing the
notorious screening conditions could one be recognized as a Divine
Maiden and become the Priestess of the Land of the Fire Blossoms.

Black hair as fine as silk and eyes like obsidian.

One must have fair skin, not be flat-footed, possess the mental strength
to endure a month in darkness, must possess the element of fire…

…And not have even a small scar on their body.

Those were just a few of the requirements. Only those who passed the
strict examination criteria, which filled several pages over a
three-month testing period, could attain the position of a Priestess.

Eventually, Miya became the Priestess and, in an instant, obtained
everything her sister Mei had wished for.

Miya wanted to make a fresh start with her sister, who had lived a hard
life. She had no doubt that their future would be filled with happiness.

However, the emotion that Mei felt towards her sister was neither joy
nor pride.

It was boiling jealousy.

“Aaaaah…! Ah, aaaaah…!!”

Mei trembled all over, screaming incessantly as if struck with aphasia.

The healing team carried her away on a stretcher, and Isaac and the
Nine-tailed Fox silently watched her leave.

Priestess Miya.

In the memories of the first iteration, recalled during the Trial of
Sandstone, Isaac was immersed in deep regret for those he couldn’t
protect.

Thus, he had harbored even greater affection for them.

This included the Priestess.

However, Isaac was not pleased with the new “Priestess’s” arrival,
belittling her in his thoughts, and without hesitation, he took revenge
on her for any incident that angered him.

He never regarded her as a comrade or as someone he needed to protect.

Since the Priestess, one of the comrades who stood against the Evil God
alongside him, was not the black-haired girl being carried away on the
stretcher.

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae lowered its head.

\[What have I… until now… what have I done…\]

As the Nine-tailed Fox seemed to be heartbroken, Isaac stroked the
beast.

It was quite easy to realize what conversation had taken place between
Mei and the Nine-tailed Fox.

The Nine-tailed Fox looked at him with teary eyes.

“Horan, the 3rd Martial Imperial Court of Haeseo.”

\[…?\]

“Go to its basement.”

Isaac whispered in a soft and soothing voice.

In Horan, Land of the Fire Blossoms, the 3rd Martial Imperial Court of
Haseo was an abandoned palace in a very remote location.

It was wrapped in strong barriers and ironclad security, forbidden even
to high-ranking officials of the Land of the Fire Blossoms.

Only the Priestess and her registered familiars could enter and exit the
Martial Imperial Court.

It was for religious reasons, but Miya’s sister, Mei, exploited this.

“Now you’re free. Go ahead, even if it feels like you’re being fooled.”

***There…***

“…You’ll find someone you’ve wanted to see.”

A Priestess was a being who handled sacred flames.

The only reason Mei was able to prove her qualifications as a Priestess
and solidify her status by displaying sacred and unusual red flames to
the people of the Land of the Fire Blossoms was because…

…She had trapped her sister, who had fallen for her trickery, and used
her as a source of mana.

Status, power, wealth. Mei wanted everything that Miya had obtained.

She overlooked the fact that… it was like grains of sand. Even if she
clutched it for a moment, it would quickly slip through her fingers.

The only reason such a thing was possible was because Miya deliberately
fell into her sister’s trap.

She thought it would be better for the Land of the Fire Blossoms if her
more competent sister became the Priestess.

Miya likely didn’t know that her choice would lead to the creation of a
tyrant.

Isaac looked into the Nine-tailed Fox’s eyes with indifference.

Now that the Nine-tailed Fox had regained its freedom from Miya’s
sister, Mei, and knew the truth, there was nothing to hesitate about.

It was time for the sleeping Miya, who avoided fate and responsibility,
to finally awaken and confront the Land of the Fire Blossoms with the
truth about serving someone unworthy of the Divine Maiden’s
qualifications.

This would undoubtedly cause significant political upheaval and public
confusion, but it was a necessary ordeal for the Land of the Fire
Blossoms to endure.

The Nine-tailed Fox’s eyes widened.

\[How do you know that…\]

At that moment, the Nine-tailed Fox realized.

From the first day of the entrance exam, Isaac had been extraordinary.

Indeed, her instincts had not been wrong.

\[So, it’s you…\]

***Is he the Nameless Hero Mei had been searching for?***

It must have been this man who had slain the demon that emerged from the
shadows.

A being who had reached the realm of an archwizard performed
incomprehensible acts as if they were only natural.

Especially if he was a Nameless Hero, he would be viewing this world
from a higher realm, understanding even the incomprehensible domains,
far beyond the Nine-tailed Fox itself.

It made sense that he would be able to find out the true position of the
Divine Maiden.

“See you later.”

\[…\]

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae engraved the smile of the legendary archwizard
in her eyes.

The freed fox magic beast turned into fox fire, soared into the sky, and
began to depart somewhere.

If, just if, what Isaac said was true… it promised to repay that grace.

Everyone gathered at the outdoor dueling ground and watched the fox fire
cross the night sky. It looked like a beautiful meteor.

Thus, the Nine-tailed Fox departed far away in search of a dear friend.

\*\*\*

It was silent and cold.

Flames were lit inside the dark abandoned palace. With every step, the
sound of crumbling stones could be heard.

Upon closer inspection, a tiny hole hidden by a bookshelf was visible.
Perhaps it was made to let air circulate.

Pushing the bookshelf aside revealed a passage. Inside, there were
stairs leading underground.

Descending the stairs to the basement, a gradual warmth was felt.

Upon reaching the basement, a crackling sound was heard.

In the center of the basement, amidst gently flowing, unusual blue
flames.

A girl was suspended in mid-air, asleep as if time had stopped, with
only her billowing black hair quietly dancing.

As if longing to see her, the Nine-tailed Fox captured the beautiful
girl’s image in her teary eyes for a long time.

\[Miya…\]

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae extended flames.

*Whoosh!*

The flames emitted by the Nine-tailed Fox damaged the large magic tool
filling the surroundings.

The comfortably sleeping girl regained consciousness as the magic tool
malfunctioned, causing a disturbance in its flow of mana.

Miya slowly opened her eyes.

She looked around in a daze. When the Nine-tailed Fox came into view, a
gleam appeared in Miya’s eyes.

Gradually, Miya’s body descended to the ground.

Finally, as the blue flames completely died down, she could not muster
the strength in her legs and fell to her knees.

It was because she had stepped on the ground for the first time in a
long while.

“Mae…?”

She had been wandering in a dream.

The times she had happily chatted with the Nine-tailed Fox were repeated
countless times in her dreams.

To Miya, the Nine-tailed Fox was a precious friend.

The Nine-tailed Fox silently approached and rubbed her cheek against
Miya’s.

Taken aback, Miya soon smiled softly and embraced her long-lost friend,
savoring the warm touch.

She could not tell what had happened.

But it seemed clear that the Nine-tailed Fox had come to rescue her,
allowing Miya to smile.

\[I missed you.\]

“…I’m sorry I couldn’t come to find you sooner.”

Miya rode on the back of the Nine-tailed Fox Mae and left the ruins.

The sound of insects pierced her ears. Around them, there was nothing
but broken building debris and bushes.

The night sky, seen for the first time in a long while, was incredibly
beautiful. The ethereal moonlight and bright stars were dazzling.

She had been helplessly asleep since falling into Mei’s trap, but
leaving the Priestess’s position to her sister was entirely Miya’s own
choice.

She wanted to see for herself the results of her choice…

She was determined.

“Let’s go, Mae.”

The Nine-tailed Fox Mae, carrying the true Priestess, moved forward.

The night deepened.

Chapter 194: The Grand Festival — Interlude (1)
===============================================

**༺ The Grand Festival – Interlude (1) ༻**

Horan, Land of the Fire Blossoms, was a nation deeply intertwined with
religion.

The Priestess bestowed by the gods wielded immense power, and as a
tyrant, her authority was unbreakable.

Though Miya became a Priestess because she was born with the sacred
flame.

The realization that the lives of so many people depended on her weighed
heavily upon her.

However, Mei was different.

─ ‘If it’s too hard, let me know. I can take over as the Priestess for
you. We look exactly the same anyway, so no one will notice.’

Mei offered to ease Miya’s burden.

She convincingly took over Miya’s role and displayed the dignity of a
Priestess to the people.

Miya believed her twin sister Mei to be the most intelligent person in
the world. She idolized her sister for her decisiveness, sound judgment,
and swift execution.

Thus, Miya thought it was Mei, not herself, who deserved to be in the
higher position and considered herself just a fool born with a mystical
power.

That mindset was created by Mei.

Every day, she would subtly compare her sister’s naivety to her own
competence, undermining her sister’s confidence. Mei would reassure her
that it was okay, that she had her, and made her dependent.

It wasn’t long before Mei, acting as the Priestess, lured Miya into a
trap she’d set for her.

She wanted the sacred flame.

That power was the difference between Miya and Mei. The reason Miya, not
Mei, had to be the Priestess.

Mei believed that with that power, she could become the true Priestess.

In reality, Miya had already found out her true intentions. It wasn’t
hard to guess what Mei was aiming for.

But she willingly fell into such a trap.

For the sake of the Eastern nation, it would be better if her wise
sister became the Priestess. That it would be fine if she shared her
sacred flame with her.

So, she planned to resolve the issue by talking to her.

However, she never imagined that it would lead to her being plunged into
a deep sleep and exploited like a factory, having her power constantly
drained.

Miya’s last memories before being forcibly put to sleep were Mei’s face
twisting into a grotesque smile she had never shown before.

It was the moment when it became clear to Mei that she was merely a tool
for her own sister’s ambitions.

─ ‘Sister, why…?’

─ ‘Do you know?’

Before being consumed by a magic tool far larger than herself, Miya
couldn’t forget what Mei had said.

─ ‘Back when we were starving, all I could think about was selling you
off for some quick cash.’

─ ‘You were nothing but an insurance.’

Miya fell into a deep sleep.

During the years when her sister reigned as a tyrant, Miya was tormented
in a nightmare.

Mei took everything Miya had built and made it hers.

The shrewd bureaucrats, who suspected whether the current Priestess was
really Miya, sent men to assassinate her after Mei had them politically
buried.

Mei focused on ensuring the security of her position.

Then, she thought.

She needed a strong force.

Authority and wealth were concepts that existed within human societies.

But to protect herself, she needed a force that was not part of societal
structures… What she needed was pure power.

Eventually, she remembered the story of her sister, Miya, becoming
friends with the Nine-tailed Fox in the Forest of Death.

It might be useful. A flame beast that even hunting parties couldn’t
defeat would serve as an excellent ally.

Mei approached the Nine-tailed Fox, pretending to be Miya, and presented
an unfair familiar contract to the magic beast.

The fox, wanting to be with Miya, readily accepted the contract and
became Mei’s familiar, raising her status as a Priestess.

She looked down upon the world from the top of the palace.

The ugly world she once looked up to when she was small felt too
confined.

Mei’s gaze stretched beyond the horizon.

Her ambitions only grew larger.

\*\*\*

“You’re usually unlucky, aren’t you, Isaac?”

“Why do you ask all of a sudden?”

“Well, you were involved in both incidents during the Grand Festival.
Pierre Flanche acted out in anger because you got him disqualified, and
Miya called you out to settle a grudge from a previous duel… You seem to
get tangled up in misfortune.”

“I don’t think that’s my fault, though…?”

“I’m not criticizing you. I just feel sorry for you.”

The Grand Festival ended on a sour note.

I gave my statement to the faculty as someone involved in the incidents.
Not earnestly… but by mixing truth and lies.

I told the truth about Mei calling me out for a fight.

However, I claimed not to know what happened after I fainted. I omitted
the part where I activated \[Hunter\] and defeated Elmetona, pretending
to be unaware of it.

The gap was filled by the appearance of the Nameless Hero, an archwizard
who appeared on the clock tower with the White Dragon.

The faculty and the Imperial Knights witnessed this, indirectly proving
that I was not the archwizard.

The Nameless Hero immediately fled from the clock tower. Naturally, that
wasn’t me.

It was Kaya, dressed in the magic cloak I had lent her. The already
summoned Hilde had grown in size thanks to the mana I infused.

Fortunately, the academy and the Imperial Knights seemed to believe that
it was the Nameless Hero. With Hilde’s appearance, I would have believed
it too.

‘And…’

Hilde said that the Phantom Cat Cheshire hadn’t followed.

I was certain because I paid close attention to mana detection.

Why hadn’t it followed? It didn’t know? Did it miss her? Or maybe
because there was something more important it had to pay attention to?

Thinking about this naturally led me to question Alice Carroll’s
movements.

‘Alice went straight to the dueling ground.’

As if she decided it was more important to observe me than the Nameless
Hero who had appeared on the clock tower.

It wasn’t a good sign. It was necessary to assume the worst-case
scenario.

In case Alice was convinced that ‘Isaac is the Nameless Hero.’

Before being interrogated, I was treated at the academy hospital. I
wasn’t badly injured, and thanks to Dorothy casting a healing spell on
me, I was told that I only needed a few rehabilitation treatments for a
while, so I was discharged fairly quickly.

The problem was Mei.

She was beaten badly by the demon Elmetona and was in terrible
condition. Despite receiving advanced healing magic at the church, she
couldn’t move for about a week.

Now, I think it was time for her to leave the stage.

Early morning. The dim light pierced through the leaves.

“Sir Isaac, I’m here.”

“Sit here.”

I was sitting on a stump at Norhan Lake, inside Josena Forest.

After Kaya Astrea sat down on a chair I had prepared next to me, I took
back the cloak from her and put it into my magic pouch.

“It must have been burdensome for you.”

“Not at all! I’m fine with anything if it’s your order.’

It wasn’t an order.

Kaya’s unwavering loyalty was incredibly admirable.

I responded with a smile.

“What would you like as a reward?”

“A reward? That’s absurd! I’m your loyal follower, Sir Isaac…! Just one
smile from you is more than enough. I’m prepared to do anything as long
as I can see it…!”

“…”

Kaya answered passionately.

I was momentarily taken aback by the uniqueness of her response but
realized she was projecting the contents of a novel she had recently
read onto us, so I let it slide.

“Is that so?”

“But Sir Isaac, will people really believe that the person on top of the
clock tower was the real Nameless Hero?”

“I don’t think it will fool everyone…”

I couldn’t really do much about skeptics or those who theorized about
every single possibility.

The nagging question of why the Nameless Hero was surveying the academy
from atop the clock tower remained unresolved.

“…But It’ll be okay.”

That much was enough.

It was far better than the arrows of suspicion being directed straight
at me.

\*\*\*

After parting ways with Kaya, I made my way to the academy’s classrooms.
The festivities were over, and it was time for all students to return to
their daily routines.

While heading to Class B for the second-years of the Magic Department, I
organized the current situation in my mind.

I had defeated Elmetona the Ethereal, cleared the Priestess of the Red
Lotus, and gained a significant amount of EXP. I leveled up a total of
four times, bringing my current level to 122.

And with the achievement, \[Dwindling Flame\], my \[Fire Resistance\]
increased by 30, reaching 50, making it B Grade.

I invested all the stat points I had gained into \[vs. Human Combat
Power\], which was now at 68 or -A Grade.

‘Now, all that’s left for this semester is…’

❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ 「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」.

I needed to prepare for a confrontation with Alice Carroll.

The Student Council President who always smiled, joked around with me,
persistently asked me out on dates, and called me ‘Baby’ whenever we
met.

…I had no hesitations. I had already made up my mind from the start. I
had to fight Alice with the intent to kill.

Alice had always been bloodthirsty and couldn’t control herself when she
saw blood. I had seen it firsthand in the Trial of Frost.

So, it was clear she was someone I had to deal with.

I just didn’t want to leave any doubts in this journey. I wanted to know
three things.

‘Who Alice was, what she was hiding, and why she committed suicide
immediately after her defeat…’

As I thought about it, I naturally thought of the Priestess.

I reminisced about the faint memories and emotions that still lingered.

During the first round, I had to grapple with deep regret for not being
able to protect the Priestess.

My aversion to the current Priestess, my indifference when Luce targeted
her, my unhesitating revenge that left her nearly incapacitated during
our last duel, and my inability to feel even the slightest affection for
her until now.

It was all because she was not the true Priestess who had been my ally.

The world would soon be in an uproar over Miya and Mei.

I crossed the wide hallway when I reached Orphin Hall.

But somehow… I felt the sharp gazes of the students passing through.

“That’s Senior Isaac.”

“He’s really handsome…”

“But is he really worth all the fuss?”

“He’s sexy, smart, cool, diligent, has a great body, and is hot…”

My ears perked up. I wasn’t sure why they were talking about me.

I had heard that the number of my admirers had increased among the
freshmen, but I hadn’t expected it to be this high. Feeling flattered, I
quickened my pace to the second-year floor.

“The star has arrived.”

“He should have been beaten up yesterday. Kugh.”

“He’s definitely good-looking…”

“Good grades, and surprisingly a genius.”

***No, what’s this? I don’t understand why they’re acting like this.***

***Is it because of yesterday’s incident?***

No, that couldn’t be right. Complimenting my looks and grades, what did
that have to do with battling Mei?

Even the few students who were talking about the Nameless Hero started
talking about me when they saw me.

‘What on earth is going on…’

I decided to ignore it and entered the classroom. Many students in the
room stared at me.

As soon as I settled through the uncomfortable atmosphere and found a
seat, Mateo Jordana and a girl with black rabbit ear ribbons, Amy
Holloway, approached me.

“Hey, Buddy.”

“Hi, Amy and Mateo.”

“Yesterday was so crazy, right?”

“The appearance of the Nameless Hero?”

“Ah, there’s that too.”

Amy sat on my desk and leaned forward to whisper.

“About the beauty contest.”

“Contest?”

***What?***

The beauty contest was an event aimed at lifting the spirits of the
student body before the closing ceremony.

Dressed beautifully, female students from each grade competed in a
battle of beauty.

More focused on training, I was practicing magic in an empty training
hall during the contest.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the beauty contest was merely a side event
for character appeal. There was no reason for me to see it.

“It must be nice to be so popular. Man, my heart was racing yesterday.”

“…?”

“Hehehe.”

Ignoring Amy’s chuckling, I turned my head towards Mateo.

“Did something happen during the contest?”

Amy and Mateo were both surprised.

“…You weren’t there? You didn’t see the absolutely wild finale?”

I nodded my head.

“My goodness…”

Amy and Mateo rubbed their foreheads and sighed.

Soon, Amy began to tell what happened yesterday.

\* \* \*

Before the closing ceremony of the Grand Festival. The last event was
the beauty contest.

In front of the entire academy, female students adorned with various
ornaments took the stage.

Dressed in beautiful gowns, their beauty was enough to captivate the
full admiration of the entire student body.

Hosted by Amy Holloway, the beautiful girls showed off their charms as
they competed in several recreational activities and talent shows.

A final vote was held to determine the ‘Märchen Academy Goddess of
Beauty’.

“The winner of the Märchen Academy Goddess of Beauty is…!”

Ta-dah.

It was Snow White Von Kairos Elfieto.

She was in a pure white dress which was adorned with a pink hairpin and
golden ornaments.

Famous for being the most beautiful woman in the world, she had already
captured students’ hearts from the moment she first stepped on stage.

Her adorned appearance was so stunning that she almost didn’t look
human.

It was even jokingly said that the Lord Manhalla must have sculpted her
and claimed her as his magnum opus. Her beauty was truly unbelievable.

Following her in second place was Luce Eltania and third place was
Dorothy Heartnova.

Amy stood next to White and brought her megaphone closer to ask how she
felt about winning.

White, who had been tense and stiff throughout the whole pageant,
suddenly thought of someone and showed a wistful expression.

Her response quickly caused a significant stir.

“There is someone I trust the most in this Academy. Someone who cares
for me deeply. He loves me, sometimes reprimands me, but most
importantly of all, he always keeps me on the right path. I… like this
person the most in this academy. I dedicate all this honor to ‘Senior
Isaac.’”

Everyone’s jaws dropped open.

Next to her, Luce’s expression turned icy. Her head turned toward White,
creaking like a broken machine. Her lifeless blue eyes stared at the
Princess.

Standing on the other side, Dorothy opened her mouth in astonishment.

Kaya, another contestant, felt like she was being pulled by the back of
her neck. She felt dizzy and started to stagger.

Amy was flustered to hear her friend’s name, but she naturally smoothed
the situation and continued with the proceedings, thinking, ‘Of course,
Isaac is her mentor after all.’

But the students, whose hearts had melted at White’s cuteness, could not
recover from their shock.

Next, Amy asked Luce how she felt.

Usually, the second and third places had a standard response. They would
say that they were disappointed for not winning, but they would
graciously acknowledge the winner.

However, Luce ignored all that and glared at White.

Luce was known for her adoration of Isaac. It seemed she was rendered
speechless after hearing White’s comment.

“Ahaha…! Luce, you seem too overwhelmed with emotions to express your
thoughts, but that’s okay, because you’re really, really pretty!”

Caught off guard by Luce’s murderous intent, Amy somehow managed to
defuse the situation and move on.

“Okay, moving on! Lastly, Dorothy, please share your thoughts…”

“Hiyaa!”

“Ack!”

Dorothy simply snatched the megaphone from Amy and shouted.

“I love my fans, my friends, and everyone else here! But in this
academy, the most precious person to me is you alone…!”

Dorothy stretched out her right arm, spreading her fingers and making a
‘V’ sign.

“…Isaac! Aren’t I the prettiest girl you’ve ever seen? It’s okay if you
fall for me, you know. I don’t mind. Nihihi.”

A radiant smile spread on Dorothy’s face.

The entire student body was shocked once again.

\* \* \*

“And that’s what happened.”

In Class B’s classroom. Amy finished her story, holding up her index
finger.

“My goodness…”

I facepalmed my forehead.

<span id="0193_195_The_Grand_Festival__Interlude_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 195: The Grand Festival — Interlude (2)
===============================================

Gastric fluids refluxed, and I poured the vomit into the bag I had
prepared in advance.

My body shivered, fatigue swept over me, and my head ached. It
definitely felt like overexertion.

"I'm really going to die."

I cleaned up the bag and gulped down water.

***One more time.***

Ignoring the strong aversion arising throughout my body, I devoted
myself to training 7-star elemental magic.

It seemed like I was called a public enemy among the male students.

It was because of what White and Dorothy said during the contest. The
rumor that “Isaac is a player” was highlighted again.

It was a dishonorable rumor for Princess White, so it seemed that rumors
involving her were restrained.

However, the rumors between Dorothy and I were spreading wildly.

The Dorothy fan club guys glared at me with anger. I challenged them to
a duel if they didn't like me, but none of those guys actually accepted
my challenge…

…Instead, it was accepted by people like Tristan Humphrey, who had no
interest in my love life, or those who just wanted to fight for the fun
of it.

It seemed like I had to endure uncomfortable stares for a while. I
intended to live quietly until the rumors died down.

Suddenly, a squeaking noise rang in my head, and a strange sensation
flowed through my entire body.

The moment I sensed trouble, I was immediately struck by a sharp pain
that made me writhe on the ground without mercy.

"Ugh...! Aaagh...!"

A symptom that could suddenly occur from overusing mana.

A pain that covered my entire body occurred briefly, feeling as if my
flesh was being torn apart.

I hit my body hard several times. That made it a bit better.

I caught my breath and lay sprawled on the floor.

It felt like I was going to die.

\*\*\*

"Is my approach wrong? It doesn't feel quite right..."

"..."

Lately, 7-star magic has been the main focus of my daily routine.

In the library, I occupied half of a table large enough to occupy
several people with the books I had prepared. Behind me, Luce, on her
tippytoes, rested her chin on my shoulder.

At first, she was a distraction, but since she helped with magic circle
construction practice and formula modification, I now found myself
relying on her.

If someone asked why she was there, I honestly wouldn't have known. She
just appeared beside me at some point. It seemed like her ability to
erase her presence was getting stronger by the day.

It wasn't the exam period, and the aftermath of the Grand Festival was
still in the air. Fewer students were roaming the library than usual.

Therefore, occupying half of a large table wasn't considered a nuisance.
Nonetheless, my conscience made me take the most isolated spot
available.

"It's Senior Isaac."

"Can he even read like that?"

"Seems like a show-off."

Occasionally, students glanced over as they passed by, due to the many
books sprawled across the table.

A total of 13 books. Elemental Studies, Intermediate Elemental
Specifics, Advanced, and higher-level stages, among others.

I had all the books open, speed-reading through the necessary parts to
aid in the composition of formulas. Without constructing proper
formulas, one couldn’t use magic.

That was my routine lately.

First, familiarizing senses. To handle 7-star magic, it was necessary to
practice harmoniously blending the sensations of using various spells.
It was essentially groundwork. It felt like my head and mana circuits
were going to explode, but I was repeating that dreadful task countless
times on the training grounds every day.

Second, constructing formulas. From 7-star magic onwards, my mana
circuit conditions must also be considered when devising formulas. That
was hard enough, but the process of devising and mastering the basic
formulas, which are the foundation of magic, was incredibly difficult.

I repeated the task of drawing magic circles or creating formulas that
needed to be calculated on the parchment I brought in abundance. Given
the number of books, it wasn't a task that could be done sitting down.

Since the maximum number of books that could be borrowed at one time was
3, there was no helping it here. I wanted to master 7-star magic as soon
as possible.

It was all to defeat the Evil God and survive.

I couldn't afford to care about the students' stares, now could I?

"Is it hard?"

"It will take some time to figure this out on my own. Mastering it is
another issue."

Similar to someone trying to obtain a certification by attending online
or academy lectures, it was a moment when the help of someone became
crucial.

There were various reasons why talented individuals attended academies.

Psychological stimulation through competition, networking, and acquiring
a diploma that would set one up for life, among other reasons.

Among these reasons, there was also for purely learning proper and
efficient methods of mana usage and spell casting. That was precisely
why I was so focused on my classes.

At that time, I gained a lot by learning various operational methods for
each elemental magic and acquired crucial magical knowledge.
Self-teaching and developing incorrect habits would virtually be a waste
of quality talent.

Here, a drawback of the academy became apparent. Students of similar
levels received the same education. This was the biggest reason for the
division between those who favored private tutoring and those who
supported the academy. The only solution seemed to be receiving private
tutoring during the vacations.

Even the high-level Class A currently had a curriculum specialized in
training 5 and 6-star magic.

My current situation was akin to someone who scored a top grade in the
social studies section of the high school entrance exam deciding to
tackle a law exam problem set. No, it was even more absurd than that.

But if only I could grasp the direction of the operation.

Perhaps I, with my maxed \[Magic Training Efficiency\] and \[Learning
Efficiency\], could manage the rest on my own.

Luce took her chin off my shoulder, looked at the parchment, and sighed
softly.

"If only I had the ice element, it would have been better. I'm not of
much help."

"You've been a lot of help. Sorry, but stay by my side a little longer.
I'll repay you later."

"I won't say no to that."

Luce smiled gently, then fell into thought.

After a while, she said…

"Isaac."

"Hmm?"

"I just thought of a good idea."

\*\*\*

*Crash!*

"Ugh?!"

Luce barged into the Professor’s office in Orphin Hall, dragging me
along.

As soon as we opened the door, it looked like a zombie was there. No,
not a zombie, but the graduate student Marco.

I was shocked at his dreadful appearance, but he seemed just as
surprised, falling over in his chair.

Luce glared at the fallen Marco, maintaining a poker face, and uttered
just two words.

"Professor."

"Wha-?"

"Location."

"T-the..."

Overwhelmed by the ferocity of the second-year top seat, Marco, with a
face full of fear, pointed towards the office.

Luce, holding my wrist, walked towards the inner office.

Luce began turning the doorknob even before knocking. Disregarding
etiquette, she brazenly swung the door open.

As the door abruptly opened, Professor Fernando Frost, a handsome
silver-haired man working on documents at his office desk, came into
view.

"Is that Luce Eltania? And behind her... Isaac, I see."

Without replying as if to say, "What about it?" Luce dragged me towards
the office desk.

Standing in front of the desk, Luce looked at Professor Fernando and got
straight to the point.

"I need a teacher."

Though still lacking in manners, she had made significant progress.

This was Luce, who used to avoid even the slightest conversation with
others unless it was an official occasion. This much was considered a
great leap forward for her.

The process might have been somewhat radical, but it was, nonetheless, a
bittersweet development.

"So, Luce Eltania, you're telling me you barged into my office without
permission because you wanted to see me, your teacher?"

"Just a moment."

Still, manners should be minded. That was too brash of us. It would be
best if I made amends now.

The plan Luce suggested would be really beneficial for me if it worked
out. Now that things had come to this, I couldn't just be indebted to
her.

I stepped in front of Luce, pushed up my glasses, and put on a friendly
smile.

"Professor, it's been a while since I've become a second-year. Have you
been well?"

"Unfortunately, it's too late for formalities. State your business."

Professor Fernando was calm, but I could tell he was upset through
\[Psychological Insight\].

I needed to get straight to the point.

"I would like to meet Aria Lilias, the Tower Master of Hegel Magic
Tower."

Aria Lilias.

She was the mentor of Professor Fernando Frost, a person not easily
accessible under normal circumstances. However, she was someone who
always made time for the professor.

I already knew this through my knowledge of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
and Luce said she found out by chance during her internship at the magic
tower.

Professor Fernando frowned.

“Why?”

“Because, to my knowledge, she’s the most proficient in magic theory on
this island, and she specializes in the ice element.”

To be precise, she specialized in both ice and water.

“Who told you that?”

When I subtly gestured towards Luce, who had undergone apprenticeship at
Hegel's Tower, Professor Fernando quickly understood.

“I wish to master 7-star magic. I’m having trouble finding the right
direction and was hoping for your assistance. Could you possibly help
me, just this once, out of goodwill for being a Class D student of yours
last year?”

“...”

Most students graduate from Märchen Academy having mastered up to 5-star
magic.

While they did learn 6-star magic, academy students were still at a
student level. Very few manage to master 6-star magic before graduating.

Even the 7-star magic was something that only the seniors in their third
year, the final year, specifically those in Class A, barely managed to
grasp in theory.

Initially, those proficient in handling and teaching 7-star magic were
in such high demand that they wouldn't settle for merely being
professors at an academy.

However, the story changed with Aria Lillias.

Her mana mastery, as seen in various exams, was unparalleled. Moreover,
it was hard to find a tower master who couldn't handle magic of 7 stars
or higher, even in a smaller-scale tower like Hegel's.

"Last year, you were a poor student in Class D, and now, you want to
learn 7-star magic, which even elite wizards might barely manage to
master after thirty years... Are you out of your mind?"

Professor Fernando, seemingly incredulous, let out a chuckle of
disbelief and leaned back in his chair.

He was well aware of the fact that I was considered a genius; I was
known as someone whose talent blossomed late due to circumstances.

Perhaps for that reason, no one at the academy, including Professor
Fernando, doubted my talent anymore.

"Privately providing unequal educational opportunities is something I,
as a professor at the academy, could be censured for. Were you aware of
this when seeking my help?"

"Isn't it the duty of a professor to extend educational opportunities to
students who wish to learn in-depth?"

I wasn't suggesting becoming a graduate student.

"I'm sorry for barging into your office without permission and being so
direct with my request. But I really do need your help, Professor
Fernando."

I bowed. Luce looked taken aback, but after I nudged her, she smartly
bowed her head as well.

Though Professor Fernando might seem indifferent on the outside, he was
actually quite generous and took great pleasure in seeing his students
grow. So, there was a chance he would help.

A sigh from Professor Fernando followed.

"That comment wasn't meant to spark a debate about the responsibilities
of a professor, you know."

Professor Fernando tapped his pen against the desk.

"Why go to such lengths? You've already achieved so much in such a short
time. With your rate of growth, you'd be able to master 7-star magic
much faster than most students. Wouldn't it be better to hone your
skills up to the 6-star level according to the academy's curriculum?"

Professor Fernando's point was valid.

For example, knowing how to use \[Frost Explosion\] didn't mean you had
mastered everything about it. 5-star spells could be utilized in various
forms, and their applications were plentiful.

Moreover, there were many spells up to 6-star that would have been
beneficial to learn.

In essence, graduating after thoroughly mastering spells from 1-star to
6-star meant one had truly made the most out of the academy.

The problem was, that the enemy I must defeat was the Evil God. Within
the three years, or rather, less than three years of my academy tenure,
I had to reach a significantly higher realm.

"Well, my reasons are…"

I straightened up and met eyes with Professor Fernando.

"...I aspire to reach an even higher realm, Professor."

There was no better excuse than the desire for improvement.

After making eye contact with me for a while, Professor Fernando blinked
slowly and then turned his gaze back to the documents.

"In that case—"

*Bang*

\[It's not a bad idea.\]

Suddenly, a small magic tool, a messenger, hidden under the wardrobe,
flew towards us.

Given the pretty decorations, it seemed to belong to someone of high
status.

When Aria Lilias's voice was heard, Professor Fernando was the most
shocked. His poker face collapsed as he widened his eyes.

"Teacher?"

\[Student, bring these children to where I am in a week.\]

"More importantly, why did your messenger pop out from there? This is
almost like stalking..."

\[There’s no need to ask such useless questions.\]

I remember reading in the setting of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ that Aria
Lilias cherished all the students she had ever taught.

But that... As Professor Fernando said, it seemed almost like stalking.
She had been listening in on how the professor had been in his office,
right...?

\[Student, your name?\]

The messenger approached right in front of my face.

"I am Isaac."

\[If you wish to become my student, passing a test is mandatory.
Everything else comes later. In a week from now, I will test whether you
have the capabilities to become my student. Be prepared in advance. You
too.\]

The messenger also glanced at Luce and spoke.

***Why her?***

With a click, the messenger's transmission ended, and it went back under
the wardrobe.

Professor Fernando abruptly stood up and created an ice rod using \[Ice
Generation\].

He rummaged under the wardrobe with it, picked up the messenger, and
headed towards the window.

The messenger activated again, and a voice flowed out.

\[Ungrateful bastard. Do you dare to cast me aside so disrespectfully?
Cease your actions this instant and reconsider…!\]

*Whoosh.*

*Bang.*

Professor Fernando threw the messenger out the window and immediately
shut the window firmly.

Then, as if nothing had happened, he returned to his original place.

"...Is she always like that?"

"Haa. It’s nothing new."

Professor Fernando’s sigh reverberated throughout the room.

<span id="0194_196_The_Grand_Festival__Interlude_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 196: The Grand Festival — Interlude (3)
===============================================

“Well, I was planning to ask you from the start.”

Professor Fernando turned his gaze to the documents on the desk and
spoke indifferently.

“Let me point out that it is not only a Professor’s duty to help out
passionate students, but a responsibility. At least, that’s what I
believe. Fortunately, the situation was resolved quickly.”

I knew Professor Fernando’s values well. His earlier dismissal was a
test of sorts, but now, his words were sincere.

“Like any teacher, she also prefers disciples with exceptional talent in
magic. I may have lacked talent and only became a disciple because she
favored me, but I believe she’ll like you a lot.”

Considering what happened a little while ago, it was doubtful whether
Professor Fernando really became her disciple because she favored him.

But that was beside the point.

“Anyway, do you know what will be on the test?”

“She’d likely try to gauge your level. I’ve heard that was the case for
all the tests she has given; it was the same for me. Be prepared to be
pushed to the limit.”

“Can’t you give me a hint?”

“My advice won’t be of much help. It’s up to her. I had to memorize
dozens of books in three days. I heard another disciple had to decode a
magic circle with over a hundred strokes within three days.”

“Were there many who failed the test?”

“Most did. They were all average. I might be considered average too, but
I was lucky.”

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there were no routes for the player to
become a disciple of Aria Lilias.

Luce, who was not limited by the knowledge of the game, gave me the
solution of “becoming Aria’s disciple.” I wouldn’t have thought of such
a solution on my own.

I had no idea what kind of test I would face, but from the examples
given by Professor Fernando, it was clear that it was going to be quite
difficult.

*Three days…*

Perhaps the only thing they had in common was that it was that they had
a duration of three days.

“...Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Professor. We will be on
our way.”

I politely thanked him and then left the Professor’s office with Luce.

“Isaac.”

“Yes?”

“I want to take this opportunity to say, your talent has excellently
bloomed. You are a disciple I can be proud of.”

“…”

*Sniff.*

To think I’d receive such warm words from him.

Feeling pleased, I flashed Professor Fernando a bright smile.

“With your abilities, you could contribute to the advancement of magical
technology. If you have such aspirations, I hope you’ll have time for me
next time—”

“I’ll see you in a week.”

I grabbed Luce’s wrist and promptly left.

*Did you really think I wouldn’t notice the blatant attempt to recruit
me as a teaching assistant?*

The thought of becoming a graduate student hadn’t crossed my mind, not
even a little.

“Isaac.”

Walking through the halls of Orphin Hall, I stopped and turned to Luce
when she spoke.

Maintaining her poker face, Luce only extended her fingers to make a V
sign and placed it next to her face.

“Ta-dah.”

She wanted credit for the success of our plans.

“Thanks. You’re the best.”

I gave her a big thumbs up, and Luce grinned.

I met the requirements to learn the 7-star ice spells \[Icebolt\] and
\[Perennial Snow\].

The condition of being “level 120 and above” had been met after I
defeated Elmetona the Ethereal.

However, that didn’t mean I could immediately use those spells. These
conditions were merely the prerequisites.

Spells like \[Ice Wall\] and \[Frost Explosion\], which only required
complex mana mastery and simple calculation, could be used right away
after fulfilling the learning requirements.

The level of difficulty spiked significantly from 6-star onward.

It felt like jumping directly from an undergraduate to a Ph.D. program
that requires highly complex calculations.

The only reason I somehow managed to learn 6-star magic while solely
relying on self-study and the occasional help of others was due to me
maxing out my potential. However, the difficulty of 7-star magic was on
another level.

If only it were like a game where I could just type in commands to
execute a skill… but I was done complaining about that last year. I’d
have to study hard.

Now, if only the Tower Master of Hegel could help me learn 7-star magic,
everything would be perfect.

Pass the test first? I’d make it through somehow. Gritting my teeth and
forcefully achieving my goals was my specialty, after all.

So, I could only hope that the Tower Master’s teaching skills were on
par with a top-tier instructor.

*I hope to master it before I have to confront Alice.*

The final event of Year 2 Semester 1, 「Alice Subjugation」. Most of the
enemies were human. There were too many enemies for Dorothy to handle by
herself, so it was inevitable to divide the roles.

It was unpredictable what variables might arise.

At the very least, I needed to be capable enough to have a fighting
chance against the Paladins. For that, high-level spells like 7-star
magic would be necessary.

Also…

*I also need to prepare for The Abyss.*

The boss during my third-year. The demon that transcends even
providence, The Abyss. Its chains were already loosening.

As mentioned before, the appearance of the Abyss would trigger the bad
ending for 「Eternity」.

Those devoured by the Abyss gained eternal life inside its body and must
live in solitude in an infinite prison.

Eventually, those who lost their self-awareness were stripped of their
souls, and the Abyss would forever play with those souls like toys.

The soul would forever experience acute pain with a vivid sense of
awareness. By then, it would be irreversible.

Hence,「Eternity」. A fate worse than death.

To defeat the Abyss, we must unleash a power that transcends providence.

Something like Ian Fairytale’s acquisition of the ultimate weapon of the
light element, Luminous Sword, in Year 2 Semester 2.

However, what if the Abyss appeared before Ian obtained the Luminous
Sword?

*...I have to do something.*

The one who was loosening the reins of the Abyss was the final boss of
Year 3 Semester 1, Mephisto the Contractor. Or, more accurately, his
power.

If Mephisto was aware of the existence of the Nameless Hero and started
unleashing the Abyss early…

I had to equip myself with the firepower to take down the Abyss as soon
as possible.

“What are you thinking about, Isaac?”

“Just… what kind of test it might be.”

I quickly composed myself and smiled in response to Luce’s worried
voice. I should really pay more attention to my expressions. Though it
might already be too late.

With her sharp eyes, Luce had already read my emotional state. The fact
that she quietly moved closer to me said it all.

“I’m glad I can join in.”

*I’ll protect Isaac.*

Luce whispered as if to reassure me

\* \* \*

“Are you alright, Priestess?”

“I thought I said not to enter without permission.”

“But you haven’t eaten anything for three days.”

“I know that. I don’t care, so just leave.”

“...Understood.”

In the private room of the Academy Hospital, Mei growled as she sat on
the bed and looked out the window. The escort wizard left the room with
a worried look.

The room was filled with lonely silence once more. Mei looked down at
her body.

It was wrapped tightly in bandages. She was still in intense pain.

Mei gritted her teeth and clutched the blanket tightly. She couldn’t
understand why things had turned out this way.

The Nine-tailed Fox had left. The moment the magic beast revealed the
truth or found Miya, it would all be over.

If the forces escorting her were to head to the Eastern Nation, they too
would soon come to know the truth.

The situation was dire. Things might improve if Miya forgave her, but
that was doubtful.

It was practically certain that the Eastern Nation would turn against
her. Her only option was to flee.

Yes, to avoid the worst possible future, she would have to escape to a
foreign country and live in hiding. The sooner, the better.

“Damn it…”

A small flame sparked and flickered from her hand.

When she fought Isaac, her powers were drained by a demon. It would take
over a week for her condition to improve.

In the end, she had to manage with her weakened body for the time being.

During the semester, the academy was closed off from the outside world.
There were only two routes off the island, the land bridge and the port.

To pass through the land bridge, she had to break through strict
security. Unless she dropped out or received a royal command, breaking
through was difficult.

And since she had to be disciplined after her treatment, her request to
withdraw from the academy would be withheld until she received her
rightful punishment according to the academy’s regulations.

Her only choice was the port. The port was only open to students during
vacation. Sneaking onto a cargo ship and hiding inside would be her only
way out, but she would have to sneak past the detection network spread
across the ship.

In other words, all escape routes were blocked.

At this rate, she could only wait while twiddling her thumbs… until the
Eastern Nation learned the truth and asked the Zelver Kingdom for
cooperation to hand her over.

“I’m sick of this…”

As Mei pondered ways to escape, she trembled with frustration.

A deep sense of despair washed over her.

“I’m so sick of this…”

Outside the hospital room door, the escort wizard lowered her head and
listened quietly as Mei sobbed.

\*\*\*

In the middle of the night.

A middle-aged man was staggering home, drunk. It was a small village on
the outskirts of the Zelver Kingdom.

There were low-rise residences surrounding him.

It was very dark at night in such a small town. Since most houses were
unlit, the man had no choice but to rely on the moonlight as he walked.
However, because of his drunkenness, the darkness didn’t bother him
much.

He hiccuped continuously, humming a tune to himself. As he walked, he
noticed a woman in a black cloak staggering towards him from the
opposite direction. He wondered if she was also drunk.

Even in the dark, the fluttering cloak and the woman’s curvy silhouette
caught the man’s eye.

Intoxication made it difficult to exercise self-control. Giving in to
his rising desires, the man spoke to her.

“Hey, Miss… Your body is really nice, hic.”

The woman in the black cloak stopped in her tracks. Her face was hidden
under the hood.

“Was there such a fine woman in our village…?”

She turned to look at the man.

“Uh, uh…?”

As soon as the man saw the woman’s face under the hood, his eyes widened
in shock, and he froze in place.

“Aaaack!!”

The effects of the alcohol dissipated. He screamed and stumbled back
before running away in a panic.

She did not bother to chase after him.

The moonlight illuminated the woman’s face. The gnawed flesh, torn
eyelids, white eyes, and pale skin. She looked like a corpse.

She staggered across the village again, her black cloak fluttering with
dark magic.

She left the village, climbed the mountain, and entered an abandoned
church. It was crumbling and had no ceiling.

Inside, corpses dressed just like the woman stood in orderly rows facing
the altar as if they were devout believers.

In the ancient altar, a coffin oozed with dark mana.

\[Gwaaaah…!\]

\[Gueeeek!!\]

A chilling aura was emitted from the gathered corpses inside the church,
converging towards the coffin.

*Rattle.*

The coffin, concentrated with power, opened, releasing heavy mana.

Something arose. A skeleton about 2 meters tall, draped in an elegant
black robe. It unnaturally floated up from the coffin, then softly
stepped onto the ground, scattering dark mana.

From its hollow eye sockets, a terrifying mana shone like eyes. In its
right hand, dark mana condensed into the shape of a staff.

A large magical staff embedded with a purple mana stone. It was his
magic weapon.

\[Arise.\]

A strange, deep voice.

*Kooooo*

The ground rumbled. An entity that should not have awakened stirred to
life, spreading vile mana all around.

Countless human cries echoed as something buried beneath the ground
shattered the mound of soil, shooting toward the night sky.

It was a black dragon made of darkened human corpses.

It was the Evil Dragon Orchis, who had been defeated by the Great Witch
of Heaven’s Wrath and Thunderbird Galia.

\[Praise him.\]

The corpses bowed their heads in unison to greet their master.

The Lord of Death. The demon, Calgart the Necromancer.

*He… has awakened.*

Chapter 197: Teacher (1)
========================

"Merlin, what should I do?"

The colors of the once vibrant garden had since turned green. The sweet
scent of spring had long since departed.

Around the time when the freshmen were getting used to academy life,
Princess Snow White felt depressed.

White was sitting on the dry grass, leaning against the base of a tree
near Orphin Hall, expressing her troubles to Merlin Astrea, who was
standing right beside her.

It was a usual affair. Merlin was now unsure whether to consider this a
part of her duties as a knight escort.

"It's because of me that Senior Isaac is suffering from malicious
rumors... rumors that he's a player. I didn't mean it in a romantic way.
I meant that I liked him out of respect... that was what I meant in my
victory speech, but I never expected things to turn out this way..."

White, shook her hands tremulously, her face stricken with grief.

It was about the beauty contest held during the Grand Festival.

White was chosen as the Goddess of Beauty at Märchen Academy during the
Grand Festival, having won first place.

It seemed that her victory speech, dedicating her honor to Isaac, whom
she trusted and respected the most, was unintentionally conveyed with a
different meaning to the students.

─ ‘I... like this person the most in this academy. I dedicate all this
honor to “Senior Isaac”.’

The expression, “I like this person,” was the problem.

“Like,” or, “Love”.

Students love sensational topics, and many knew how attractive Isaac,
the male student, was.

With a handsome appearance, outstanding talent, abilities, diligence, a
promising future, and maturity beyond his years as a student... it would
be a lie to say many female students did not find Isaac attractive.

However, as Luce’s intimidating aura was so strong, most female students
had no choice but to suppress their budding feelings.

White used the phrase, “I like this person,” which ignited the fire
among two female students, Luce and Dorothy, who were already heavily
involved with him... This rekindled the rumor that had died down last
year of, “Isaac being a player”.

As a result, White's victory speech naturally came to be seen as her
expression of “Love” for Isaac.

It wasn’t that Isaac did not seem like a potential romantic interest,
but the feelings White had when she looked at him were much closer to
“Like”.

*I should have been more careful with my words…*

White regretted it for days.

Without even knowing it, Isaac even got into a fight with the Priestess
and was seriously injured. When White was called in as a person involved
in the incident, she heard that the Priestess had brought up White and
staged a drama.

Isaac must have fought with the Priestess, the ruler of the Eastern
Nation and a genius with Grade S mana, for her sake.

Naturally, White felt tremendous guilt over everything. That was why she
ended up confiding her troubles to Merlin.

"That should be okay, right? The Sir Isaac I know is a thoughtful
person. Someone who would not be disappointed over such a matter…"

Merlin couldn't finish her sentence.

It was a terribly dishonorable rumor, after all.

If Merlin herself had been the subject of the rumor that she was a
player, she would have immediately wanted to find and cut down the
person responsible.

It didn't matter who took White's victory speech properly or not. People
interpret what they see and hear in their own way. The problem was that
the rumor had already spread in such a manner.

What about this case? While it was true that White had been careless,
Merlin struggled to decide if it should strictly be considered her
fault.

"Wouldn't the issue be resolved if you have a good conversation with Sir
Isaac? After all, most conflicts are resolved through conversation."

Merlin managed to respond with difficulty.

Whatever the case, it was ultimately an issue between Isaac and White.
If Isaac just let it pass without much fuss, the rumor would die down.

The problem was, had that been the case, White's troubles wouldn't have
persisted until then.

With a sad face, White shook her head.

"But you've seen it too, Merlin. These days, Senior Isaac has been
avoiding me. He hardly talks, and when he does, it's always with short
answers... I thought everything was resolved after my apology, but now
it feels like we've grown even more distant..."

Lately, Isaac had only been formal with White.

A few days ago, White had explained the situation and apologized to
Isaac. He told her not to worry about it because it wasn't her fault,
and he was actually grateful that she thought of him.

So, White had been relieved, believing that everything had been
resolved...

But afterward, their conversations were brief and strictly about
academics.

Whenever White tried to bring up a personal topic, Isaac would only
respond with dry answers like "Yeah," "Uh-huh," and "Right," so they
never had long, normal conversations.

In actuality, however, Isaac was just focused on mastering 7-star
elemental magic.

White, being used to his kind demeanor, incorrectly perceived it as him
being uncomfortable around her.

The person she could be most comfortable with in this academy was Senior
Isaac. She couldn't bear the thought of growing distant from him.

"There must be a reason. It will be okay soon."

"What if…"

"Yes."

"...What If Senior Isaac feels uncomfortable around me and ends up
wanting to leave me... what should I do?"

When people start feeling uncomfortable around someone they were close
to, they gradually distance themselves until one day, they just leave.
White was worried about this. At that time, Isaac seemed to be
distancing himself from her, and she feared he might eventually abandon
her.

"How could Sir Isaac abandon Princess White? He even fought the
Priestess for you. He's not someone who would do that."

"That's true… isn't it?"

"Even if that were to happen, so be it. There's no need to hold on to
someone who wants to leave."

"That's also true..."

White let out a sigh of helplessness.

Merlin found her expression endearing and smiled silently before quickly
composing herself.

"Don't worry too much. You'll be receiving guidance from Sir Isaac soon,
you shouldn't be so disheartened."

"I'm not disheartened, just hurt. If I've done something wrong, I'll
have to make an effort to fix it..."

White spoke lifelessly as she got up from her seat.

"Should I go see Senior Isaac?"

\* \* \*

At a corner of the Hydrangea Garden, White's wind magic swept over the
lake.

"White, take a break."

"No, I think I'm still okay! I can do more... Uh-oh, nosebleed!"

"I said take a break."

White was more diligent in her training than usual. It was clear she was
trying to show me her best, and regardless of the reason, it was a good
thing, which brought a smile to my face.

"Time's up. Good job."

"Haaa, haaa... It's over...!"

After finishing training, I created a rock chair using \[Rock
Generation\]. White, drenched in sweat, weakly sat down on the rock
chair and caught her breath.

In the meantime, I brought over five pieces of parchment that I had
prepared in advance and handed them to White. They were all rolled up in
scroll form.

"Here, this is your homework."

Flustered, White fully embraced the parchment within her arms.

"Ah, Senior Isaac, why is there so much homework today...? You usually
only give me one..."

"Sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to mentor you for a while."

“…!”

Suddenly, White became as rigid as stone, as if she had heard a bolt of
lightning out of the blue.

"It's probably because my schedule won't allow it."

"Why, why?!"

"Do you remember I said I was going to learn a 7-star spell?"

As I took off my glasses and asked, White nodded.

"I got the opportunity to learn that from the Tower Master of Hegel. She
said if I passed the test, she would take me as her disciple. The test
will probably last for three days."

He spoke calmly as he took off his glasses and wiped the lenses with a
cloth.

"If I pass the test, I won't have much time. I'm planning to pass no
matter what."

He was determined to do everything possible to pass the test set by Aria
Lillias, along with Luce.

If he passed the test and started receiving training, he didn't know how
his schedule would be adjusted. What was certain was that his free time
would be significantly reduced, making it difficult to continue teaching
White.

"So, I think I need to focus on my own tasks right now. I'm sorry. Let's
disband for now..."

As he put his glasses back on and looked at White's face, he was
suddenly lost for words.

A look of shock was on her face. From her mouth, a whining, “Heeee…”
sound emerged, making her seem as if she had lost her mind.

*Why is she acting like this?*

"White?"

"I'm okay... I'm really, okay..."

She didn't look okay at all.

I read her psychology.

*What's this? Is she worried that I might abandon her forever?*

*Why all of a sudden?*

I rummaged through recent memories related to White and guessed the
reason.

Come to think of it, I haven't been talking to her much lately.

I had been preoccupied all day with constructing 7-star formulas, which
naturally reduced our conversations significantly.

Was she taking it sensitively? To think that she felt I was distancing
myself just because of that...

...No matter how hard I tried to understand, it was futile.
\[Psychological Insight\] couldn’t make me fully comprehend the
psychology of a teenage girl, after all.

Anyway, it would be better to reassure her before leaving. The problem
was that I was too thoughtless, saying, “Let's disband,” when we
wouldn't see each other for a while.

"White."

"Yes..."

I took out a pudding bar from my pocket, unwrapped it, and held it out.

*Whoosh!*

Merlin sprinted over and, taking a bite of the pudding bar, ran past us.
At that moment, a gust of wind arose, whipping her hair and the hem of
her dress.

Done. I held out the pudding bar, about one-third of it gone, in front
of White’s mouth.

White looked back and forth between the pudding bar and me, bewildered.

"Study hard and improve your skills. Make me surprised when I return."

White had not been able to pay off her debt by the last due date.

So, I said that if we could circulate and share our mana with one
another, the time spent doing so would be deducted from her debt. It was
a training method to enhance Mana Mastery and Elemental resistance, a
direct way to tap into White's potential power.

We talked about it last time and tried it out. Contrary to my
expectations, White couldn't withstand the mana backlash and ran away in
a panic to go vomit somewhere. Ultimately, we decided to extend the due
date.

Because of that, White showed a mix of happiness and bitterness. The
expression was adorable.

Regardless of White being a key figure in Semester 2 Year 2, I felt a
deep affection for her. I couldn't even joke about abandoning her.

"You're coming back, right...?"

"Huh?"

Suddenly, White asked in a subdued voice, looking down. It seemed she
was trying hard to gather her courage to ask a sincere question.

"You're really coming back, right...?"

White slowly lifted her head and looked at me. Her eyes were moist, and
tears were welling up around them.

White gently grasped the collar of my clothes.

"I'm such a lacking person... hic, a pest that only causes trouble for
you, Senior... You're not trying to distance yourself from me,
right...?"

White's voice choked up as if she was about to cry any moment.

I got goosebumps.

*Why the self-deprecation?*

"You have talent and you're doing well, why would I leave your side?"

"Then, Senior Isaac, please come back soon... I'll miss you..."

Her effort to hold back tears was so funny that I let out a chuckle. I
nodded.

Finally, it seemed White relaxed a bit as she took a bite of the pudding
bar I offered and chewed happily.

"Sniffle, it's delicious..."

White took the pudding bar entirely, savoring its taste with a sad
expression.

\* \* \*

\[It's quite funny, isn't it.\]

The sky was inked and the stars shone brightly.

In the student council room, only the lamp on the office desk emitted a
soft glow.

Next to it sat a fat purple cat, Phantom Cat Cheshire, who spoke to the
girl with pale gold hair in front of him. She was the Student Council
President, Alice Carroll.

Alice sat in the president's chair, gazing out the window and holding a
cup of tea.

\[Meow\~. Let's go over the situation once again!\]

Phantom Cat Cheshire stood up abruptly and spread its front paws to the
sides.

\[The Black Monster, always swiftly defeating demons and running away,
appeared on top of the clock tower as if it had been watching the
academy...! As soon as people noticed, it ran away at once! But, you
know, it's strange.\]

On the last day of the festival, the Black Monster, The Nameless Hero,
was acting suspiciously.

Alice took a sip of her tea.

\[The White Dragon flew to the Black Monster, didn't it? So, the
teachers and Imperial knights, looking at the White Dragon, naturally
had to notice him. As if he wanted people to find him! As if to
distract, to hide something, he deliberately drew their attention!\]

Suddenly, the Phantom Cat's head tilted to the side.

The magic beast's eyes shone sharply, like the blades of a knife.

\[Isaac, let's kill him.\]

Alice stopped her hand from taking a sip of her tea.

\[It's clear he's the Black Monster. He gave the cloak to his colleague
and created an alibi…\]

"Cheshire, go back."

\[Meow? Suddenly?\]

*Whoosh.*

Alice reversed summoned Phantom Cat Cheshire.

Soon after, dark mana began to seep out from the inside of her choker.
It rose above her head like smoke and took the form of a head, albeit a
monster, it was closer to a female form.

Alice remained still, looking out the window without changing her
expression.

Soon, the head made of dark mana moved its lips.

\[Venerable Alice, how are you...?\]

It was a bizarre female voice.

\[It's almost time... Enough with the games, don't you think...?\]

From the cheekbone area of the strange head, an arm surrounded by dark
mana protruded. It was a skinny, frail arm.

A hand with seven slender fingers gently stroked Alice's hair.

\[For the sake of the kingdom you cherish…\]

The mysterious being whispered.

\[Please... faithfully fulfill the contract.\]

Soon, the figure made of dark mana disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Indifferently, Alice was about to sip her tea again but then placed the
teacup back on the desk.

She touched her choker with her finger. Her hand gradually started to
tremble.

Alice deeply scratched her choker with her fingernails. Despite the
grating sound, her nails breaking, and bleeding, she paid no mind.

Eventually, Alice silently exhaled a deep breath.

Chapter 198: Teacher (2)
========================

The rain was pounding on the wooden shutters of the carriage,
threatening to break them. It was a gloomy and depressing day, fitting
for the challenging test set by Aria Lilias.

Luce and I skipped class for “study purposes” with the permission of
Professor Fernando and the authority of the Hegel Tower Master, who had
a partnership with Märchen Academy.

Missing a few classes should be fine. I had asked Amy and Mateo to take
summary notes for me.

We were neatly dressed in casual clothes. We were meeting a very
important person, and Professor Fernando had told us to dress nicely.

A few days ago, Professor Fernando rummaged through his office and
claimed to have found Aria’s second messenger which he hadn’t gotten
around to disposing of. Before throwing it out the window, he asked,
“Why did you call Luce Eltania too?”

She said that she had heard of Luce’s overwhelmingly talented and that
she wanted to teach her because they share an attribute.

*Good.*

Luce was being considered for the Evil God Slayers. In other words, if
Aria were to make Luce stronger, it would be good for me too.

After some time, we arrived at the Hegel Tower in Professor Fernando’s
personal carriage. It was a two-hour trip.

“This is Hegel Tower.”

Hegel Tower was, as its name suggested, a tall building in the form of a
tower. It was no exaggeration to call it the tallest building on the
island.

However, despite being called a tower, it looked quite shabby compared
to the castle-like magic towers that were built in cities. It had a
humble appearance and the shops that were a short distance away only
added to the cozy charm of this place.

Luce and I followed Professor Fernando inside Hegel Tower. The high
ceilings gave it an old-fashioned design.

It had a serene atmosphere. As we entered, Professor Fernando explained
various things as if he were a tour guide, mentioning the numerous
magical researches conducted here and the achievements made. He was
someone who enjoyed teaching.

As we walked by, we occasionally saw wizards in robes. Their attire was
so cool, so I glanced at them curiously.

We took an elevator powered by telekinesis magic to go to the highest
floor. According to Professor Fernando, only a select few, like himself,
were allowed to go up to the top floor.

When we reached the top, we found ourselves in a luxuriously decorated
hallway. A short walk across the hallway brought us to a large door.

“Can we just enter?”

“It’s fine. She already knows we’re here.”

*Creeeak.*

As Professor Fernando opened the door, a vast library came into view.
The circular space was filled with numerous books and magic tools
floating around.

Looking up, we could see the high glass ceiling, beyond which rain was
pouring down. The whole tower had a barrier that prevented rain from
hitting the windows and causing noise.

Once we entered, we saw a petite woman sitting on a desk, swinging her
legs as if waiting for us. She appeared bored.

This was the first time I had directly faced her since I was brought
into this world.

“Greetings, Master.”

Professor Fernando bowed, and I followed suit.

Auburn hair swept to one side, tired eyes, and a wizard’s robe.

It was Aria Lilias, the Tower Master of Hegel.

She stepped down from her desk and approached us.

“Follow me.”

Aria pushed past us and out the door.

Professor Fernando followed her without question, and Luce and I
exchanged glances before following them.

We took the Tower Master’s private elevator to the rooftop, where the
sky was covered with gloomy dark clouds.

Aria created an invisible umbrella using telekinesis over our heads.
Then, she walked to the center of the rooftop and looked up at the sky.

“Isaac.”

“Yes.”

Aria called for me.

“Can you explain to me what ice magic is?”

“...It’s magic that freezes by taking away heat. That’s why its more
accurate name is freezing magic, but that alone would make it less
versatile, so it also creates ice using the mana from nature and the
caster’s mana. That’s why it’s commonly known as ice magic.”

“No need for a detailed explanation. You’ll see it with your own eyes.”

*Why did she ask that?*

Aria took out a magic tool from her robe and tossed it upward. The
small, baseball-sized tool, a messenger. It fluttered like a swift bird
and hovered under the dark clouds.

Then, she reached out her right arm towards the messenger.

A powerful mana enveloped the rooftop.

With a whir, seven pale blue magic circles unfolded behind Aria. Runes
were engraved on them, each intricately detailed and complex.

“This is \[Icebolt\].”

*Boooom!!*

From the seven magic circles, a pale blue bolt of energy shot toward the
messenger.

A beautiful frenzy was carved into the air, and a deafening roar rang
out.

*Booom!!*

A cold explosion swept around the messenger. Cold air flew in all
directions, and for a moment, it snowed.

*Ohh.*

*Amazing…*

The blast hit the constantly moving messenger with pinpoint accuracy. It
was like the work of a marksman.

If one’s mana mastery wasn’t properly trained, it would be difficult to
aim at a target accurately, let alone produce such a sophisticated
spell. It was admirable.

Aria gathered the magic circles and turned to look at me.

“Applause.”

Without hesitation, I applauded Aria’s display. Luce, catching my cue,
also clapped a few times.

“This is the 7-star ice spell \[Icebolt\] that I will teach you. Whether
or not you can master it is up to you.”

I responded loudly with a, “Yes!” my lips twitched with excitement.

*Was Aria always this cool?*

“Luce Eltania, the same goes for you. I will make you stronger, so
follow me.”

“…”

Luce didn’t respond. She tended to avoid speaking unless absolutely
necessary, except when talking to me.

Aria frowned.

“Respond.”

“Luce, answer.”

“...Okay.”

Luce answered reluctantly.

Aria held up three fingers.

“For the next three days, you will be tested. This is to determine if
you are worthy of my teachings, so do your best without being arrogant.”

“We’ll do our best!”

“Yes…”

I replied loudly, and Luce answered forcefully with a frown.

“You should go downstairs first, Disciple.”

“Yes, well then…”

Professor Fernando turned his back.

“Isaac, Luce Eltania, I’ll be back in three days.”

He had fulfilled his role. Professor Fernando turned on his heel and
headed down the elevator.

“You two.”

Aria raised one corner of her mouth.

“Brace yourselves.”

\* \* \*

Three days passed.

Fernando Frost finished his lecture and immediately took his carriage to
Hegel Tower.

Isaac and Luce Eltania must have completed their test and were resting
by now. They probably haven’t eaten or washed properly in three days, so
they must be exhausted.

For Fernando, Aria's test was brief but it left a strong impression in
his memory.

He believed Isaac and Luce would pass the test. He wanted to quickly
take them back to the living quarters so they could rest comfortably.

Upon arriving at Hegel Tower and taking the elevator, he reached the top
floor and slightly opened the door to Aria’s lab to peek inside.

“…?”

Isaac and Luce were nowhere to be seen.

All he could see was Aria Lilias, hovering in midair, reading a book
indifferently.

Fernando stepped inside. Aria glanced up at him, then turned back to her
book.

“Master, how are you? Where are the kids?”

Fernando asked as he approached her, and she let out a deep sigh.

“My disciple.”

“Yes?”

“Those kids are monsters.”

\*\*\*

After talking to Aria, Fernando headed to the lab on the 15th floor.

He heard an unbelievable story. Isaac had passed the test in just 10
minutes, and Luce in 5 minutes.

So Aria went straight to teaching and realized…

…Their learning capabilities far exceeded her expectations.

Isaac was able to figure out how to construct \[Icebolt\] as soon as she
gave him some directions.

No matter how difficult the mana control task was, Luce would correct it
immediately after receiving feedback.

*— My accumulated knowledge, wisdom, and abilities are insufficient for
them. There's not much I can do for their growth, not as much as I
thought.*

She was impassive as usual. But for the first time, Fernando felt that
she seemed disheartened.

It was a teacher’s dilemma. A capable student was preferred because they
were fun to teach, but if the student was too exceptional, the teacher
could start to doubt their abilities.

Perhaps Aria experienced the latter this time.

Fernando quietly cracked open the door to the lab and peeked inside, his
eyes widening in surprise.

Three large blackboards, several times taller than him, were filled with
formulas.

Isaac, with deep dark circles under his eyes, was reading a book and
writing down formulas.

He was surrounded by dozens of books. It wasn’t hard to guess that Isaac
had studied for three days and three nights without sleeping.

His level of concentration and stamina were frightening.

Unless it was a power bestowed by a fairy, like Kaya Astrea’s plant
element or Dorothy Heartnova’s starlight element…

Most elite wizards invest over thirty years to master 7-star magic. That
boy was drastically compressing that time.

Meanwhile, Luce Eltania was sitting at a desk, reviewing the formulas
Isaac had written and sharing her opinions. She also looked tired but
seemed to be in better shape than Isaac.

They were provided with room and board. Aria had offered them one room
as a joke, but it seemed like the two hadn’t properly utilized the
accommodations yet.

“Hehe…”

*These kids are really something.*

Fernando smirked and left the room. He figured it’d be better to come
back later.

\*\*\*

After a week.

The sky was clear and tinged with the colors of sunset.

Fernando headed back to Hegel Tower. He received a summons from one of
Aria’s messengers in his office, instructing him to come to the tower
immediately. He had heard that Isaac was on the verge of reaching the
next level.

He took the elevator to the rooftop. The sky was a deep shade of blue,
with stars beginning to shine.

Isaac, Luce, and Aria were standing on the rooftop.

“Master?”

“Shh.”

Isaac stood in the middle of the rooftop. He looked weary and exhausted,
but his eyes were clear and sharply focused on the sky above.

Luce, Fernando, and Aria watched him from a distance.

Looking ready, Isaac silently released Aria’s messenger. It flew into
the sky and began to circle above.

Isaac concentrated on sensing the natural mana around him, taking into
account its strength, density, and the direction of the wind.

Like a craftsman assembling parts with precision, he meticulously drew
the formula for the 7-star ice spell \[Icebolt\], ensuring the lines
were connected correctly.

Then, he reached out his right arm.

With a resonating sound, seven pale blue magic circles trailed behind
him. Each had a complicated configuration.

“He really… deployed seven magic circles.”

Fernando’s eyes widened in awe.

Seeing Isaac correctly deploy the magic circles for the 7-star ice spell
\[Icebolt\] was unbelievable.

It was truly a phenomenal talent.

Considering he was once the academy’s weakest, the endless manifestation
of his potential felt dramatically impactful.

Isaac’s eyes locked on the flying target.

He furrowed his brows. It was difficult to aim properly. The mana
mastery needed to launch \[Icebolt\] was also difficult, making his mind
feel extremely chaotic.

“Hooo.”

He took a deep breath.

Isaac extended his right hand, making the shape of a gun with his index
finger and thumb. His index finger calmly chased after the messenger.

Soon, the pale blue magic circle glowed simultaneously.

Isaac unleashed a blast of cold mana.

「Icebolt (Ice Element, ★7)」

<span id="0197_199_Teacher_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 199: Teacher (3)
========================

I couldn't move.

My arms trembled uncontrollably. My mana was so depleted that none of it
could come out properly.

Blood poured from my mouth like a waterfall. My thoughts were jumbled.
Before I knew it, my vision blurred, making it impossible to distinguish
objects clearly.

Yet, I barely managed to move and swung elemental magic at my
still-intact enemy.

The enemy was the Land of Oz, The Floating Island, Cavallion the
Earthshaker.

The ground was covered with flowing lava. Countless human heads emerged,
taunting me with their laughter. Gritting my teeth, I drew upon every
last bit of my mana to unleash my magic, yet that infuriating laughter
persisted.

*If this continues we all die.*

*I can't save Dorothy.*

I screamed until my throat burst. It was nothing more than a tantrum,
but I felt like I would go insane if I didn't.

When I was fighting so frantically.

Someone cried out my name, ‘Isaac.’

I regained my senses and stopped moving abruptly. A gentle touch
caressed my cheek.

Dorothy, with black spots all over her body, appeared. She smiled
faintly and said to me,

‘Isaac.’

‘Thank you for coming to save me.’

‘...I'm sorry.’

Dorothy squeezed out the meager amount of mana she had recovered and
sent my body flying away.

A cluster of stars floated around. My body helplessly drifted away from
The Floating Island.

I yelled to stop immediately, crying out Dorothy's name. But she did not
cease her magic

Soon, a radiant glow emanated from her body.

A beautiful explosion of vivid colors swallowed the Land of Oz.

At that sight, I couldn't help but scream and cry tears of blood.

Suddenly, a cozy energy wrapped around my body. The scene before my eyes
disappeared like ash.

Staying in that comfortable sensation, I soon felt the sensation of
returning to reality.

"...Ah."

I opened my eyes. Only then did I realize that I had been dreaming.

Maybe because I had slept deeply for the first time in a while, memories
of the Trial of Sandstone vividly replayed in my dream.

It was a dream I often had. It was also the reason I couldn't get good
sleep.

*By the way, am I lying in bed right now?*

*Hmm?*

For some reason, something plump was enveloping half of my face.

My rational judgment was not yet functioning smoothly due to the
remnants of sleep. However, I felt a sense of psychological comfort.

*What's this?*

Curious, I groped around to feel what it was.

It twitched suddenly.

The felt fabric and beyond that, the sensation of an incredibly soft
mass was felt.

"Uh..."

After hearing a sticky sound that followed, I realized that I shouldn't
touch it anymore.

I snapped to attention.

I removed my hand from that plump thing and lifted my head. I saw Luce's
face, which was flushed red and pouty, glaring at me from up close.

"...Isaac, you pervert."

Luce narrowed her eyes. Her tone was irritable, but her whispery voice
made it sound enchantingly ticklish to the ear.

Luce didn't show much resistance. I could tell from her demeanor that
she didn’t feel repulsed

*Who's the pervert here?*

"Sorry... But what were you doing?"

"It seemed like you were having a nightmare."

"Ah..."

*I see. That's kind of her.*

I sat up, rotating my stiff neck, and Luce also got up.

"Thanks for that. You're right, I had a nightmare."

"What kind of nightmare?"

"...That's unfortunate."

"What's unfortunate?"

"Sadly, I forgot."

It was the memory of not being able to save Dorothy.

During my first round, I didn't have Daikan, the Primordial Beast of
Ice. So, I never thought of using the mysterious cellar key to gain the
power to defeat The Floating Island.

In the end, Dorothy self-destructs with The Floating Island with \[Last
Light of a Dying Star\].

For a while, I fell into a slump, living in self-blame whenever I felt
the emptiness of Dorothy's absence.

I was a foolish and pathetic guy.

Still, it was good that I properly regained that memory.

The more I thought about it, the more it made me struggle without
compromise.

Since I never wanted to repeat such a failure again.

"Thanks for the hug. I might smell a bit right now though..."

"It's okay. I actually liked it."

*My scent?*

Luce leaned in close to me and sniffed. Then, looking into my eyes with
a gentle smile, she said in a soft tone.

"I like the smell of Isaac."

It seemed unlikely to be pleasant. I couldn't understand Luce's sense of
smell.

"Is your nose okay?"

"Huh? It's fine?"

"Never mind..."

That could be it.

I got out of bed and turned towards the window. It was still the middle
of the night outside. Only the lamp on the desk was casting a soft light
in the dark room.

I still felt tired, probably because of the nightmare and not sleeping
well.

I scratched my tousled hair.

*Ugh, I should take a shower immediately.*

"Ugh, I feel gross. Luce, have you showered?"

"I did in the morning, but haven't since. I couldn't because I was
hugging Isaac."

"Sorry, but I'll shower first. I want to wash up quickly."

"Do you want to shower together?"

"...?"

"It's a joke. Don't get your hopes up, pervert."

I was momentarily taken aback.

Luce laughed playfully, got out of bed, and entered the bathroom.

*Huh? Wait a minute.*

"Hey, I said I was going to shower first...!"

"If you have a problem with it, come in with me."

Luce peeked her head out of the bathroom door and gave a mischievous
smile.

As I frowned and glared, she waved her hand outside the door as if
saying goodbye, then closed it.

It was cheeky, but since she had been holding me the whole night out of
concern, I had to let it slide.

The sound of running water echoed from inside the bathroom. I also heard
splashing and rubbing, it caused me to imagine Luce showering naked on
the other side.

*I don’t know how to feel right now…*

I sighed and bowed my head. Then, I noticed my clothes had been changed.
It seemed Luce had rummaged through my magic pouch, taken out a change
of clothes, and dressed me.

It was fortunate that I had entrusted Kaya with the Cloak of Disguise
before coming to Hegel Magic Tower, in preparation for such a situation.
Otherwise, irrefutable evidence of me being the Nameless Hero would have
embarrassingly surfaced.

The clothes I had been wearing were draped over a desk chair. Inside the
collar of that shirt, Hilde was hiding in the form of a small mana.

"Hilde, was everything alright?"

\[Nothing happened.\]

*...?*

Her voice seemed to quiver subtly.

*What happened?*

\[Really, nothing! Just this old one felt a bit of excitement for the
first time in a while. Heh heh.\]

*Is that so…*

Hearing her call herself “old one” in such a young delicate voice was
quite strange.

Anyway, even without further explanation, I felt I understood the
sentiment. Truly, it must have been nothing significant.

Perhaps Luce had uttered some crazy one-liner while hugging me in my
nightmare, something that could even excite a thousand-year-old granny
white dragon.

"Ugh..."

For now, regardless of what Hilde heard, I was just very tired.

*I'll ask next time when I have the chance.*

I flopped down on the bed. Despite having just woken up from a brief
sleep, the fatigue didn't leave me. Perhaps it was because I had been
skipping sleep and overusing my brain. Whatever little energy I had left
seemed to have vanished with my first use of \[Icebolt\].

Anyway, there was only one bed here.

I had already figured out that Aria maliciously crammed us into one
room. But I didn't expect there to be only one bed. How were we supposed
to sleep…?

Soon, the bathroom door opened. I could feel the humid air. Luce came
out in a bathrobe, with steam rising around her.

Her rose-gold hair was damp. I couldn't help but notice how sensual her
body appeared. I swallowed involuntarily.

"...Why are you staring like that?"

Luce asked, avoiding my gaze. She seemed to know why I was staring.

"I’m not…?"

It was a feast for the eyes. Indeed, she was my second favorite
character.

I barely suppressed the urge to hug her right then and there.

I passed by Luce and entered the bathroom.

Feeling refreshed, I showered, donned a bathrobe, and stepped out of the
bathroom. Somehow, the room was filled with the scent of herbs.

Luce, also in a bathrobe, had just placed a warm cup of herbal tea on
the desk. She had timed it perfectly for my exit.

While I showered, Luce seemed to have put on makeup. Her face was pretty
even without it, but it appeared she did it with me in mind.

"Isaac, here. This should be good for your fatigue."

"Oh, thanks."

I cooled the herbal tea with a chill and gulped it down in one shot. I
then placed the cup back on the desk.

Ah, my head wasn't working. This was the first time I had felt so
refreshed that I could die of sleepiness.

It might have been a side effect of using \[Icebolt\] for the first
time. Anyway, I wanted to sleep as soon as possible.

I immediately sat on the bed. Luce, who had been sipping her herbal tea
at the desk, looked at me and then quickly turned her gaze towards the
window. She was deliberately avoiding my eyes.

It made things awkward for no reason.

"Luce, should I go sleep in the lab?"

"Why?"

"There's only one bed."

"No, sleep here with me."

Luce was calm and firm in her response.

I was fine with it. I was relieved there was no hesitation or
discomfort.

Since I liked Luce, as long as she was okay with it, I didn't mind.

"Alright, then..."

My eyelids kept drooping. I couldn't stand it anymore.

I just laid down on the bed. The bed was large enough that it wouldn't
be a problem for two people to sleep on it.

"I'll go to sleep first."

As soon as I closed my eyes, my body relaxed. It seemed like I would
fall asleep quickly.

Ah, just one more thing before I drifted off to sleep. Luce had pulled
me out of a nightmare, after all.

“Luce.”

“Yeah?”

“Thanks for hugging me. Really.”

“...Yeah.”

Feeling Luce's gaze, I immediately fell into a deep sleep.

And in my dream, I savored a feeling of warmth and gentleness.

<span id="0198_200_Teacher_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 200: Teacher (4)
========================

It was right after Isaac successfully cast the 7-star ice spell
\[Icebolt\] and fainted.

Professor Fernando Frost left in a carriage, and Aria told Luce to
“sleep and come to my lab tomorrow morning” before she left.

Left alone with Isaac, Luce summoned Thunderbird Galia after breathing
some evening air. It was to carry Isaac.

“Heave-ho…”

Luce, along with the Thunderbird carrying Isaac, took the elevator down
to the 14th floor.

There were accommodations. Normally, towers had separate dormitories,
but this place was unique in that it was inside the tower itself.

“Here, Galia.”

Luce and the Thunderbird entered the room Aria had told them about. It
was their first time actually staying in the room, having only used the
bathroom up until now. Luce had wanted to stay by Isaac’s side, so she
had been taking naps in the lab where he was.

The room was pretty snug with only one bed. Although Luce sensed Aria’s
impure intention, she didn’t feel particularly displeased.

“Careful.”

Luce laid Isaac, who was carried by the Thunderbird, onto the bed.

Silence ensued. Luce leaned over and stared closely at Isaac, who was
sound asleep.

He had a strong scent. It was a rare opportunity. Luce closed her eyes
and breathed in Isaac’s scent, a satisfied smile spread across her lips.

**\[You must be exhausted, Isaac.\]**

“Skipping sleep, meals, and showers to focus on devising the
construction for \[Icebolt\]...”

Luce was amazed by Isaac’s stamina.

“Your clothes… should be in here.”

Luce took the magic pouch from Isaac and searched inside. It contained a
change of clothes.

While at it, she sneakily looked for any cloaks of disguise… but she
couldn’t find any.

The Thunderbird gently lifted Isaac’s upper body with his beak. Luce
then removed his top and laid it across a desk chair.

Soon, Luce was mesmerized as if time had stopped.

Isaac’s body. His muscles were distinctly visible, his veins pulsing.
Though it wasn’t very noticeable when he was clothed, seeing his
unexpectedly well-defined physique made her involuntarily swallow.

Heat rose to her head, and the corners of her mouth twitched
involuntarily. She vividly realized her biological reactions as a woman
at the sight of Isaac’s bare body.

Luce’s hand reached for Isaac’s upper body as if her instincts had taken
control over her body.

Soon, she regained her senses and stopped her own hand with the other.

She couldn’t just foolishly stare at Isaac’s naked body. After changing
his top, she laid him back down and carefully removed his pants as well.

Sneaking a glance toward Isaac’s groin, Luce nodded and blushed,
deliberately averting her gaze from his underwear as she put on new
pants for him.

Finally, after covering him with a blanket, Luce looked at him lovingly
again.

Then, she lifted the blanket, slid inside, and embraced him.

**\[…!\]**

The Thunderbird’s eyes widened.

He couldn’t believe it and reversed his summoning. He didn’t want to
disturb the two.

“Galia?”

Luce didn’t understand why the Thunderbird had reversed his summons, but
it didn’t matter anyway since his role was done.

“Hmm.”

For now, she just wanted to enjoy the sensation of lying next to Isaac.

Isaac’s body odor was fragrant. She felt a warmth that made her want to
stay like that indefinitely, but at the same time, her heartbeat sped up
with excitement.

It was as if her instincts were cheering.

“Why are you so cute…?”

Luce whispered softly, her head resting on the same pillow as Isaac’s.
Just looking at him made her smile. She felt overjoyed.

Luce had seen Isaac’s efforts closely in the Hegel Tower. She rejoiced
in his achievements as if they were her own.

However, she harbored a fundamental question.

*Why is he working so hard?*

Luce speculated that Isaac’s effort might be tied to the reason why the
Nameless Hero, Greung, hid his identity.

She had long suspected, almost with certainty, that Isaac was Greung.

Then, why was there a discrepancy in power between Isaac and Greung?

It didn’t make sense that Isaac was working this hard just to conceal
his identity. So she came up with another hypothesis…

*What if Greung can only unleash his true power under certain
conditions?*

It seemed far-fetched initially, but now it seemed worth considering
since it would resolve the contradiction.

For example, like a fairy bestowing mystical powers, it might be
possible to grant conditional strength through a contract.

Even if it wasn’t a fairy, there might exist beings of similar stature.

If that hypothesis was true, what could be the conditions for Isaac’s
abilities?

*Great strength… limited to demons…*

…As Luce pondered, the thought only grew stronger. What kind of
ridiculous ability was that?

Greung was undoubtedly a mysterious being. However, there was a strong
possibility that he was an academy student wearing a cloak of disguise…
Assuming that was true, he would seem like a normal student at first
glance.

Until the Grand Festival incident, Luce was aware of Isaac’s plan.

Given that Greung had always been running to hide his identity, standing
atop the clock tower and having the white dragon draw attention would be
something he’d definitely avoid.

In other words, it must have been intentional.

*To hide his identity.*

The only person who would benefit from Greung appearing elsewhere was
Isaac, who had fought with the Priestess.

A scholar believed that “if Isaac was the Nameless Hero, he wouldn’t
have been injured and fainted during his fight against the Priestess.”

Luce had been convinced that Isaac was Greung since the end-of-semester
evaluation incident last year.

She was the only one who felt that Greung’s hands and Isaac’s were
similar.

So, what could be the reason why Greung would hide his identity?
Probably because revealing it would lead to troublesome consequences.

If her hypothesis that Greung’s power was conditional held true, the
reason might be…

*Revealing his identity could put him in danger since he’s weak
normally.*

There might be someone at the academy who would harm him if his identity
was revealed. The basis for this though was the existence of the
“informant”.

Greung might have been concious of the informant.

However, it didn’t explain how he knew when and where the demons would
appear in advance.

Luce’s theories were all hypothetical in the first place, so there was
still a lot of mystery about Greung.

What was certain was that Greung had to be the person before her eyes.
All Luce needed was a smoking gun.

Luce tapped Isaac’s cheek lightly.

In doing so, she found him incredibly lovely and charming. It made her
realize that she had romantic feelings for the boy.

“...Haa.”

Then, Luce hardened her expression and pulled her hand away from him.

A vague feeling of dread came over her.

Regardless of the circumstances, she and Isaac were merely friends. Even
if she confessed to him, there was no guarantee that it would lead to a
romantic relationship.

The worst thing that could happen was that Isaac would start avoiding
her.

Isaac was decisive and not the type to take advantage of someone’s
affection for him.

If the only person she had opened her heart to became distant,
especially if that person was her first love… the mere thought made
Luce’s heart ache.

Yet, staying passive made her uneasy about other girls. If a bitch like
Dorothy snatched Isaac away while she hesitated, she’d be writhing in
agony, tears of blood streaming down her face.

Luce wished for Isaac to only look at her. Sometimes, she even
fantasized about locking him in a large birdcage and making him look
only at her.

However… that would break the promise she had made with Isaac.

Luce held up her left hand and stared at the ring on her ring finger. It
was a symbol of their promise, a commitment to achieve their dreams
together and live side by side.

It felt like a proposal, and Luce always felt happy whenever she looked
at the ring.

In the end, she had to push aside the childish fantasy of caging Isaac.

Luce lowered her arm and looked at Isaac again.

“Isaac, you have to stay by my side forever and ever, okay? If you leave
me… I might just break.”

Luce muttered to herself. Because the future she envisioned for herself
included Isaac, and she couldn’t imagine a future without him.

And then.

Suddenly, Isaac broke out in a cold sweat and gasped for air. He looked
distressed.

“Isaac? What’s wrong?”

Luce was startled, sitting up abruptly and asking worriedly. However,
Isaac remained asleep.

*Is he having a nightmare?*

Given how he usually gave up sleep to train, it seemed cruel for him to
have nightmares when he finally got to sleep.

Luce laid back down, pulling Isaac’s head into her embrace. She
whispered reassuring words, gently stroking his head.

*Don’t worry, I’m here.*

*It’s okay. Isaac, it’s okay…*

“...Go to sleep?”

Shaking out her memories, Luce looked towards the bed. Isaac, wrapped in
a bathrobe, was fast asleep.

Luce chuckled softly and placed her teacup on the desk. She put the
shade on the lamp, causing the room to be enveloped in darkness with
nothing but the moonlight shining through the window.

Climbing into the bed next to Isaac, Luce pulled the blanket over them,
waiting for her eyes to adjust to the darkness. She wanted to take one
last look at his face.

Once she could see Isaac, Luce smiled gently.

“Goodnight, Isaac.”

There was a rustling sound. The covers rustled as Luce hugged Isaac.

Thinking there might not be another chance like this, Luce kissed
Isaac’s cheek.

Then, she closed her eyes. Luce could finally give in to the drowsiness
that had overtaken her.

\* \* \*

The light was blinding.

The bright ceiling came into view when I woke up. It was morning.

I was so amazed that I spaced out for a while. It had been a long time
since I’d slept so soundly.

I turned my head to the side. Luce was asleep, hugging me like a teddy
bear, breathing softly. She must have fallen asleep while holding me to
keep me from having nightmares.

*So pretty.*

Thanks to her, I seemed to had slept peacefully.

I turned towards Luce and gently stroked her hair.

Today was the day we would depart from the Hegel Magic Tower.

After washing up and getting dressed, Luce and I headed to the top floor
and went inside the lab.

Aria Lilias, dressed in her wizard robe, welcomed us.

“Good morning, Tower Master!”

“We’ll conduct individual interviews right now.”

“...What?”

*What’s with the sudden individual interviews?*

“Isaac, you go in first.”

“Ah, yes.”

Aria led me to a door on the opposite side of the entrance. Since it was
an individual session, Aria told Luce to wait outside.

There was an office behind the door at the back of the lab. Aria closed
the door and walked towards the bookshelf.

*What’s this individual interview for? Am I going to receive feedback or
something?*

Aria walked over to a desk piled with documents. She sat down and looked
at me with her usual droopy eyes.

“Isaac.”

“Yes.”

“I didn’t expect you to grasp \[Icebolt\] so quickly. There’s nothing
more I can teach you. Any further instruction would only hinder your
talent.”

Aria began on a positive note.

It felt like a warm conclusion and my mood brightened.

I adjusted my glasses before replying with a smile.

“That’s not true, your guidance as the Tower Master has been a great
help since the beginning. I’m grateful, thanks to you—”

“Well, those are just a bunch of empty words.”

“Pardon?”

“This room is completely soundproof, so don’t worry. I’ll ask you
straight up, so listen carefully.”

The morning breeze fluttered the curtains.

After a brief silence.

Aria looked me in the eye and asked calmly.

“Tell me why you’re hiding your identity, Nameless Hero.”

<span id="0199_201_Teacher_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 201: Teacher (5)
========================

I read Aria's psychology.

She was convinced that I was the Nameless Hero who went around defeating
demons.

I didn't think I could cover up everything... but how did she find out?

"What are you talking about?"

"The demon appearance incident that happened last year on Elt Island."

*Is this about the hunting evaluation?*

"It was when they dug deep into the ground in the center of Elt Island
and found a mana trail. Mana trails disappear quickly when they come
into contact with air, but those buried in the ground remain for a long
time."

That wasn’t a lie.

"They collected and stored those mana trails, and compared them with the
mana trails collected from you during the academy exam. The result is as
you can imagine."

Really... it was not a lie.

I wanted to deny it, but \[Psychological Insight\] was telling me that
what Aria was saying now was the truth.

*So, indisputable proof has been out since last year?*

...I was convinced.

The underground of Elt Island.

I defeated Kaya the Ravenous and killed Elphelt the Evanescent.
Immediately after, the giant's body disappeared, and the place where its
body had been was restored to its original state.

Thus, the mana trail left from fighting Kaya the Ravenous had to be
buried in the soil immediately.

Since I was in the situation of fleeing with Lisetta Lionheart, I
couldn't take care of the aftermath.

In the end, it turned out that Aria Lilias had known for quite some time
that I was the Nameless Hero.

*So, she thought this was a good opportunity and called me.*

Teaching him 7-star magic gave her the perfect excuse to approach him in
a friendly manner.

Aria stopped talking to gauge my reaction and stared at me intently for
a moment.

*What should I say?*

I organized my cluttered thoughts.

Despite there being evidence that I was the Nameless Hero, the truth
hadn't surfaced yet. It meant someone had deliberately hidden the
evidence.

It wasn't hard to guess that the person was Aria Lilias.

Naturally, this raised a question.

*Why…?*

*…Why did she protect me?*

Perhaps taking my silence as affirmation, Aria blinked slowly and while
placing her hand on the flat box on the desk, stared intently into my
eyes.

She looked very calm and composed.

"I didn't expect you to own up to it, but don't worry."

Aria said in a calm tone.

"I'm on your side."

*My side?*

"Crucial evidence was concealed. The only things left to the public were
clues that lead nowhere, even after pondering who the Nameless Hero
might be."

"That's illegal…"

"If you're going to say something pointless, it's best if you shut your
trap."

I said that out of concern.

*Brave, to say the least, especially against the Imperial Knights.*

I let out a small sigh. It seemed that a long conversation with Aria was
necessary.

"...Come forth, Hilde."

I extended my left arm forward. The 8-star familiar contract circle
engraved on my wrist emitted a faint blue light.

Above it, ice mana formed into the shape of a small white dragon.

It was Frost Dragon Hilde.

**\[Master?\]**

Hilde landed on my shoulder and showed a troubled look as she looked at
me and Aria. It was because I had willingly revealed my own identity.

Frost Dragon Hilde. A mythical magic beast said to be handled by the
primordial ice sovereign. It was one of my greatest strengths and proof
of the fact that I was the Nameless Hero.

"It seems this serves as an answer."

Aria's eyes widened for a moment before returning to normal. So, she
could be surprised as well.

"Who else is there, besides you, who knows who I am?"

"Yo Headmistress... no, your Headmistress."

Aria changed the topic calmly.

"There might be others who suspect you, but as far as I know, it's just
the two of us. And your Headmistress is on your side as well."

To compare the mana trail collected from Elt Island with mine, the
academy's assistance would have been necessary. Especially to collect my
mana trail.

Therefore, if Elena Woodline, the Headmistress who led Märchen Academy,
was involved, there was no need for further explanation.

"Why are both of you on my side?"

"An archwizard who fights demons and protects humans. A mighty being
with enough power to easily topple empires. And the expectation that he
knows things unknown to me. I see more than enough reasons to choose a
side, and Elena has similar thoughts."

The Nameless Hero defeated The Floating Island and gained fame
worldwide.

Thus, there would have been many who considered the pros and cons
regarding the Nameless Hero and acted accordingly.

Aria was one of them.

"Isaac, you..."

Aria tilted her head.

"...If you're so powerful, why pretend? The way you practiced
\[Icebolt\] looked completely genuine to me."

I hesitated.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Aria had almost no screen time, so there
was no way to truly know her character.

So, I gathered my thoughts and came to a conclusion.

*Let's not reveal everything.*

Her assertion of being on my side was sincere, but I needed to ascertain
if she could be fully trusted before proceeding.

After all, people could change at any time, and revealing all my secrets
willingly was akin to handing over my weaknesses to them.

"I can't tell you that yet. Hilde, go back in."

**\[Understood, Master.\]**

Hilde transformed back into a form of mana and dissipated like smoke.

The familiar contract circle that was shone on my wrist vanished.

"...If it's difficult to answer, it's alright for now."

I was relieved by her understanding demeanor.

Aria opened the flat box on the desk. Inside was an old book.

She lightly waved her finger, lifting the book from the box with
telekinesis. The book floated towards me.

The book opened mid-air. Its considerably worn pages were adorned with
grotesque creature illustrations and inscriptions in an unintelligible
language.

"What is this?"

"An ancient text about demons from history."

*Is this a book about ancient demons? I had never seen such a thing in
the game.*

The pages flipped with telekinesis. An illustration depicted what I
assumed to be a demon I knew. This... clearly resembled The Floating
Island.

"Do you know what kind of creatures are referred to as demons?"

I only understood them as “demons” because that was what they were
called in the game system and by everyone else.

Of course, there was an academic distinction.

"Demonic creatures capable of using the dark element. A higher class of
Monsters."

Monsters, lacking a magic circuit within their bodies, could not use
magic and were no different from beasts that only harmed humans.

This was different from magic beasts. Magic beasts referred to
non-humans capable of using magic, and except for a few evil ones, they
were generally not hostile to humans.

Occasionally, a unique monster that utilized dark magic appeared, such
creatures were classified as demons. The level of danger was
significantly different from other demonic creatures, and without
exception, they were hostile to humans.

"Then, are you aware that these demons can reach a realm beyond that of
an archwizard?"

"Pardon?"

"No, it's not just the demons. Whether it be demons, heavenly beings,
fairies, or perhaps even humans... the closer to the realm of gods, the
more they have in common."

"...And what is that?"

The last page of the ancient text opened.

Looking at the illustration on that page, I narrowed my eyes
instinctively frowning.

A demon that looked as though it was wearing a long dress at the bottom.

That was also a part of her body.

That part was embedded with many eyes, looking grotesque and abhorrent.

As seen in the Trial of Frost, was an illustration depicting the Evil
God Nephid.

"The ability to manifest transcendent power and the presence of many
eyes possessing mysterious powers."

Aria pointed to her own eyes.

Following the Evil God, what came to mind was the truth seen in the
Trial of Sandstone.

When the Evil God brought about the end, the unknown creature that
emerged in South Korea also had many eyes.

The question was… how did Aria come to know such information, where did
it come from, and why was she bringing it up to me?

Magic towers tended to be closed off when it came to knowledge and
information, as they represented a competitive edge. Thus, it wouldn’t
be strange for Aria to possess knowledge and information known only to
her.

However, I didn’t expect it to be related to demons.

"The eyes seemed to be a matter of appearance, but what about
transcendent power?"

"Literal transcendent abilities. Creating sophisticated life forms,
altering the soul of a creature, creating another sun and moon,
intervening in other worlds."

I had already guessed as much.

I only praised it as remarkable, deliberately avoiding bringing up
anything specific.

After all, it was something I held dear.

*Dorothy…*

Dorothy avoided her predetermined death and embraced a future she was
not meant to have.

She had already demonstrated abilities far beyond the realm of humans,
observing and intervening in other worldlines.

It was as if she was acquiring transcendent abilities, like my minion,
the Primordial Beast of Ice - Daikan, who broke down the boundaries
between life and death.

A genius predicted to reach the realm of an archwizard within ten years.
Such predictions were merely made by ordinary humans.

But Dorothy was more than that.

What made her so special was probably...

*The fairy of the stars.*

Star Fairy, Stella.

In the events of Semester 2 Year 2 「Fairy War」, Stella never showed
herself. No player of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱ knew what she looked
like.

She was merely a plot device.

She granted Dorothy the power of starlight. That power must have been
what was elevating Dorothy to higher realms.

“The information I mentioned earlier was gathered by sending out wizards
from Hegel Magic Tower to collect data, obtain ancient texts, and study
legends. This has been happening long before I became the tower master."

*Is it information gleaned over a long period?*

It was strange indeed. Why did such a person have no significant role in
❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱?

“So, I'm asking."

She crossed her arms on the desk and stared intently at me.

It was time for the main question.

“Have you, by any chance, been granted power by a being with many eyes?"

*This is...*

*…What is she talking about?*

“I wanted to ask if a transcendent being had chosen you."

How would I know how many eyes the being that transmigrated me into this
world and gave me the '“status window'” had?

However, it was clear that the background of my transmigration was
related to Higgs, a game company in South Korea.

The system window UI I saw was exactly the same as the one in ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱.

It was highly likely that they were the ones who had sent me here in the
first place. Yet, their true identity remained unknown.

"...If, as you say, I had received power from such a being, what would
you do?"

"I would like to make a trade."

Aria pointed back and forth between herself and me with her finger.

"I will provide you with the information you need and help your
endeavors. In exchange, you will provide knowledge I cannot discover. I
am a wizard, a scholar in pursuit of truth, a navigator sailing the sea
of knowledge. To someone like me, you are a blessing of knowledge
bestowed by a god, a treasure more desirable than sudden wealth."

Even if one were to read every book in this world, they couldn't find
the knowledge I possess.

For example, how could a resident of this world discover that Pizza
Hut's Ribsteak Pizza was delicious?

How could they learn of the existence of the game company, Higgs and the
high-quality masterpiece ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, a game considered
ahead of its time?

Not to mention the fact that the game was set in this world.

We looked at each other in silence. Eventually, she closed her eyes,
sighed deeply, and leaned back in her chair.

"My disciple has arrived."

Professor Fernando had come.

"I need to meet with Luce Eltania as well, so we must end our
conversation here. I hope you will consider my offer carefully. And, if
you come to trust me, I hope you will share your purpose with me."

I nodded.

"Then... take care on your way."

Aria's eyes seemed to be looking at something beyond me.

I thought to myself.

Aria Lilias. She did not beat around the bush with her statement, “I'm
on your side.” and her intentions were clear. \[Psychological Insight\]
confirmed that her words were sincere.

It would be wise to keep an eye on her for the time being. She seemed
worthy of favorable consideration.

"Yes. Thank you for everything. I look forward to seeing you again,
Teacher."

I addressed her as “Teacher” in the end.

After all, she had provided me with valuable guidance.

I bowed and said my farewells before leaving the room.

“Humph.

"To think I'd live to hear 'Teacher' from an Archwizard."

It seemed absurd enough to be amusing.

Following Isaac, Luce Eltania entered for her individual meeting.

Luce looked around. A neutral spell, \[Sound Obstruction\], was deployed
in the office. It was a spell often used for soundproofing.

"I have an important question, so listen well."

Aria, with a serious expression, posed her first question.

"Did you two... do it last night?"

Aria's eyes sparkled.

Luce displayed a look of disgust on her face.

<span id="0200_202_Teacher__Interlude_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 202: Teacher — Interlude (1)
====================================

“What a disappointment.”

In front of the Hegel Tower.

As Luce and I were about to climb onto Professor Fernando’s carriage,
Aria Lilias pouted her lips, visibly upset.

Professor Fernando was taken aback as he tried to greet his mentor.

“Master, what do you mean…?”

“I had hoped those two would have made history last night. Such boring
kids… Fernando, even your students are like you, they’re no fun.”

“…?”

Professor Fernando had no idea what Aria was grumbling about. I felt the
same. I couldn’t understand what she was thinking, even after using
\[Psychological Insight\].

Luce’s ears turned incredibly red. As soon as she sat down in the
carriage, she immediately turned her head to the other side, hiding her
face. She looked extremely embarrassed.

Aria exchanged glances with me through the open door of the carriage.

“Anyway, Isaac, Luce… take care of yourselves.”

“You too, Teacher!”

Aria waved her hand. Her youthful appearance made it look like a child
waving goodbye, which made me smile. I waved back to her.

Professor Fernando also bowed before climbing onto the carriage and
sitting across from me.

The coachman started to drive away, and Aria watched us for a moment
before returning to Hegel Tower.

“Did something happen yesterday?”

Professor Fernando asked, crossing his arms and legs, looking at Luce
and me.

Beside me, Luce flinched and kept her mouth shut. It seemed it was
better for me to answer on our behalf.

“I guess it’s because we fell asleep without saying goodbye, even though
it’s our last day. Sorry, we were just too tired.”

I answered with a gentle smile typical of Isaac.

Such a thing wouldn’t upset Aria. Professor Fernando looked at Luce and
me alternately with a suspicious gaze but soon closed his eyes and gave
up. He decided it wasn’t important enough to dig deeper.

“Well, that’s fine then. How was the ten days of training?”

Professor Fernando opened his eyes again and asked.

Until yesterday, we had spent a total of ten days at Hegel Tower.

I trained diligently to learn \[Icebolt\], but thanks to the time I
spent at the tower, I was able to tie up loose ends much earlier. Aria
helped me a lot.

From a commoner’s perspective, it was an incredible achievement.

For most elite wizards, it usually took an average of 30 years to learn
basic 7-star magic.

Even the genius Tower Master of Hegel, Aria Lilias, took years to learn
it.

And yet, despite still being an academy student, I have successfully
learned it.

*How should I express what I was feeling? I don’t really know how to
explain it…*

“It was fun.”

To put it simply, I felt a sense of accomplishment, like I had just
solved an exceedingly difficult problem.

Throughout the 10 days, I felt chills running up and down my spine. I
couldn’t sleep because I was so excited.

And the thrill of finally finding the solution to the problem was
indescribable.

Moreover, Luce was with me. The word “fun” seemed quite fitting.

“For me too…”

Luce replied in a hushed voice, her gaze fixed on the window. It
appeared as though she had a sensitive discussion during our individual
interview, considering she had been shy ever since we left.

Professor Fernando and I stared at Luce.

Time passed and we arrived at the academy. After spending each day
barely sleeping and living on the edge, it felt like we had been gone
for a long time. The scenery of the academy seemed nostalgic.

“Well done. Get some rest today.”

“Thanks to you, we had a great opportunity. Thank you, Professor.”

Luce and I gathered our belongings and got off, bowing our heads to
Professor Fernando.

Professor Fernando smiled softly as he rode away in the carriage.

“Let’s head back, Lu—”

*Swish.*

As soon as I faced her, Luce whipped her head away so fast it created a
breeze. Her ears were still blazing red.

I kept a smile on my face, but I was sweating nervously.

I didn’t know what exactly happened during her individual interview. I
had already figured out Aria’s sinister intentions, but still…

*What kind of indecent talk took place for Luce to end up in such a
state?*

“Yeah, let’s go…”

Luce replied timidly with her head down. It seemed like a good idea to
give her some space to gather her thoughts.

Today was a day off, so fewer students were roaming the academy grounds
than usual. Those who were out and about were all in casual clothes.

Luce decided to go back to her dorm to rest since she hadn’t fully
recovered from our stay yet.

We reached the crossroad leading to the dorms. Luce had to go to Charles
Hall, the dorm for the top-ranked students, and I had to go to Elma
Hall, a dormitory for the middle-high-ranked students, so we parted ways
there.

I expressed my gratitude one last time. Thanks to her, I was able to
sleep soundly last night. Since I didn’t get a lot of opportunities to
rest properly, I felt that my thanks could not be enough no matter how
many times I expressed it.

Luce simply responded with a “yeah” and refrained from saying anything
else. Her ears were red, still seemingly very conscious of me. It was
cute.

Then, we parted ways.

I need to head out as soon as I get to my dorm.

*I should start training right away.*

I was in peak condition, and I was full of motivation because I had just
learned \[Icebolt\] yesterday. I couldn’t wait to master it.

I walked briskly toward Elma Hall, organizing my thoughts.

Now that I had learned \[Icebolt\], I needed to move on to \[Perennial
Snow\] and then advance to \[Abyssal Glacier\].

*Especially \[Abyssal Glacier\], I want to learn it before the vacation
ends.*

In Semester 2 Year 2, I would also need to prepare for heavenly beings
and fairies.

Preparing for both races in a single semester would leave little room
for stat distribution. Therefore, having magic that could neutralize
attacks or protective magic that could serve as a sturdy shield would
become crucial.

Like the 7-star ice spells \[Abyssal Glacier\], optimized for
neutralizing attacks, or the unique skill of the Obsidian Blade
\[Eclipse\], providing the ultimate defense.

*Also.*

When my unique trait \[Hunter\] was activated, I would be able to use
the ultimate ice spell.

The 9-star ice spell, \[Cocytus\].

Although it wouldn’t be as powerful as the one I used against Leafa the
Illusive during the first-year duel evaluation, I would certainly be
able to deliver a devastating offense.

As I was organizing my thoughts, Aria’s words crossed my mind.

*Transcendental state…*

There were only two people who have reached the transcendental realms
according to Aria, and they were both entwined with me.

One was my ultimate goal and the final destination of this journey, the
Evil God Nephid.

The other was the Candy House Witch who took in Hansel and Gretel.

The Witch died in Luce’s arms. Since then, she seemed to have ascended
to a transcendental state, though the details were beyond my knowledge.

*To become such a being… does one need to die first?*

…It was too big of a question to be answered by the single case of the
Candy House Witch. Since I couldn’t find the answers, I had to set it
aside for now.

What needed immediate attention was the upcoming scenario.

*The Alice Subjugation.*

The scripture told the story of the Lord Manhalla scattering seeds of
blessing in order to make the land of the Zelver Empire abundant. It was
the origin of the holiday known as “Red Day”.

It wasn’t long until the day arrived. An annual ceremony would be held
that evening.

As the atmosphere was reaching its peak, Alice’s familiar, the Nightmare
Dragon, Jabberwock, suddenly appeared over Bartos Hall and roared,
signaling the start of the final event of Semester 2 Year 2, 「Act 9,
Alice Subjugation」.

I was terrified when Alice brought the paladins so I was grateful that
everything had progressed smoothly so far.

Well, I didn’t expect things to proceed exactly as they did in the
original scenario. My knowledge of the game was merely a guide.
Predictions had become meaningless long ago.

My goal was to get through the scenario without anyone dying. With
Dorothy alive, our forces were strong.

Still, what bothered me was…

*Why did Alice commit suicide?*

Despite going on multiple dates with Alice, laughing and talking
together, I still couldn’t guess why she would choose to commit suicide
after losing a battle.

I arrived at Elma Hall. I decided to set my worries aside for now. It
was time to focus on mastering \[Icebolt\]. I needed to change and head
out for training as soon as possible.

As I reached for the doorknob with that thought, a strange sensation
swept through my entire body.

I froze in my tracks.

**\[Master.\]**

The voice of Hilde, who was hiding inside my collar in the form of mana,
echoed in my head.

My eyes narrowed.

The doorknob felt cold as if it had been left out in a blizzard.

*Someone has been in my room.*

*Can you sense Cheshire’s or any of the Paladins’ mana?*

**\[If it were their mana… No, not at all. I only sense a somewhat
ominous aura.\]**

I removed my glasses and tucked them inside my pocket, preparing for a
potential confrontation.

*Hilde, go in and check it out first.*

**\[Understood.\]**

Hilde’s tiny form slipped through the crack in the door.

Soon after, she spoke.

**\[It is safe to enter, Master. It does not seem to be an intruder.\]**

*Not an intruder after invading my room? What does that mean?*

If it wasn’t an enemy, then it was something I could confront directly.

I opened the door and entered my room, only to be greeted by an entity I
had never seen before.

Standing before the window was a giant, seemingly over 3 meters tall,
standing quietly.

Wrapped in what appeared to be a black cloak, his elongated body was
tightly bound. His bizarre face was hidden behind the brim of a wizard’s
hat. Not even the morning sun could hide his ominous aura.

I was met with his pale blue gaze. He had been waiting for me.

“...Who are you?”

He looked monstrous. Given that \[Demon Detection\] wasn’t triggered, he
wasn’t a demon.

I opened its status window.

\[Frost Spirit Merphil\] **Lv:** 180 **Race:** Magic Beast **Elements:**
Ice **Danger:** X **Psychology:** \[Wants to serve you as its master.\]

\[He is an old comrade of mine.\]

Hilde, the Frost Dragon, spoke in a faint voice.

<span id="0201_203_Teacher__Interlude_2.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 203: Teacher — Interlude (2)
====================================

Frost Spirit Merphil. A 8-star ice spirit magic beast.

It could be found in the magic beast section of the ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ setting book. It was a magic beast that did not appear in the
game so I was seeing it for the very first time.

It too must be quite large, similar to Hilde.

It was impossible not to remember that all 8-star magic beasts, with the
sole exception of Phantom Cat Cheshire, were set to be large in size.

Then, could that form be for camouflage?

**\[…\]**

Frost Spirit Merphil approached.

Seeing its unnatural movement as if it were on a moving walkway, I
realized it had no feet. It was floating in the air, moving like a ghost
you'd see in a horror movie.

The Frost spirit stopped in front of me and looked down at me from a
height that could reach the ceiling. His long and twisted facial
structure gave off a bizarre impression.

Then, the frost spirit bent its upper body as if to greet me and
stretched out its skinny hand. Its four fingers were abnormally
elongated.

The hand opened, and a dagger appeared.

A silver dagger.

The silver-white scabbard, engraved with beautiful patterns, sheathed a
dagger with a silver handle.

"Are you giving this to me?"

Frost Spirit Merphil nodded its head.

I grasped the silver dagger. Despite it being cold it felt comfortable
in my hand.

**\[I have been waiting... for you.\]**

The Frost Spirit spoke in a strange voice that seemed to echo in my
head.

**\[Please lead us. We will respond to your call whenever...\]**

*Whoooosh.*

After saying everything it wanted to say, Frost Spirit Merphil
disappeared into a cold mist, flowed out the window, and soon
dissipated.

That was the Frost Spirit's unique magic, \[Spiritualization\]. A magic
that allowed one to move by turning into a spirit after eliminating the
physical body.

I walked to the window and looked outside. The faint blue powder
fluttered away, effortlessly passing through the transparent barrier
that enveloped the entire island. That must be how it entered the
academy.

"Hilde."

*Chak*

After drawing the curtains,

I infused more mana into Hilde, transforming her into the form of a
small white dragon. She landed on the ground and looked up at me.

"What's going on? Since the crack of dawn, some ghostly creature came
and gave me something...?"

I was dumbfounded.

**\[Perhaps, my old comrades have noticed your existence.\]**

Hilde’s old comrades would mean the familiars or minions handled by the
primordial ice sovereign.

**\[They must have faintly sensed the aura of the \[Ice Sovereign\] that
you emitted. Especially after summoning the primordial beast.\]**

"Did you know this would happen?"

**\[I did not!\]**

Hilde answered confidently.

**\[How could I know what they were thinking?\]**

"Is that so."

It made sense. This must be a first for her too.

Anyway, this meant that magic beasts on the level of national
destruction had noticed my existence without me knowing.

**\[Ugh. Even so, the most sinister one came to find you.\]**

Hilde flew up and landed on my shoulder. Her gaze was fixed on the
silver dagger in my hand.

I drew the dagger from its sheath to inspect the blade. A chill flowed
from it, giving a cool sensation.

There were three unique magic circles engraved on the blade.

I touched it with my finger but didn't feel anything special. It was
just cold and hard.

**\[This dagger is a symbol of the ice sovereign's qualification. Its
name is the Blade of Frost Flowers. It is a Dagger of Oath and a Dagger
of Pacts.\]**

Hilde explained as if she had been waiting for me to inspect it.

**\[It is not something you can handle easily. Even if you are the
reincarnation of the ice sovereign, you are still far too weak… unless,
of course, you are fighting demons.\]**

*So what. Whether I can handle it or not is for me to decide.*

Fate crawled in on its own. My heart fluttered with this unexpected
gain.

I examined the silver dagger, the Blade of Frost Flowers, from various
angles. It was impressively cool.

Hilde glared at me with narrowed eyes and pressed my cheek firmly with
her short forelimbs.

**\[Master? Can you hear me?\]**

"I heard you. How many times do I have to say I'm not the reincarnation
of the ice sovereign?"

**\[Ugh, dagnamit. So stubborn.\]**

Hilde cursed quaintly and wore a disgruntled expression, her eyes
questioning what else I could be if not the reincarnation of the ice
sovereign.

I looked at her and said,

"Hilde, explain in detail what this is."

\* \* \*

The top-ranked dorm, Charles Hall.

The killer whale familiar, Bello, and the crow-sized thunderbird, Galia,
felt a surge of excitement as soon as they were summoned and stared
intently at Luce.

They were curious about what had happened between her and Isaac in Hegel
Magic Tower. After all, they had ended up embracing each other in the
same bed the night before.

Luce sat on the bed, her cheeks flushed.

Bello and the Thunderbird approached her with pleased expressions.

**\[Uh, Master? Did things go well with, hehe, Isaac?\]**

"Hmm…"

Luce sighed in frustration and covered her face.

Bello, who had tried to tease Luce with a sly grin, immediately shut his
mouth with a flustered look.

This was... a situation they realized they shouldn't have spoken about.

"Gallia, Bello. Just tidy up the stuff, briefly."

**\[Luce? Isn't that something you should call a maid for?\]**

"No. I want to be alone."

Luce lifelessly covered herself with a blanket and laid down on the bed.

Bello and the Thunderbird, sweating profusely, tidied up the shoes and
clothes that Luce had carelessly taken off.

**\[Hey, Gallia.\]**

**\[I know...\]**

Separated from Luce, Bello and the Thunderbird whispered to each other
up close.

**\[It seems it's still not the time to expect grandchildren...\]**

The Thunderbird's sad voice dispersed mournfully.

Last night, how eagerly it had reverse summoned itself, filled with
anticipation. The greater the expectation, the greater the
disappointment turned out to be.

The Thunderbird sighed deeply.

Before leaving Hegel Magic Tower, during a private meeting.

Aria had taught Luce snippets of a new world.

Armed with all sorts of knowledge and sexual curiosity from erotic
novels, Aria captured Luce with her calm tone while spouting erotic
stories.

She had made Luce indulge in numerous risqué fantasies involving herself
and Isaac.

Had she ever so keenly realized that she was a frog in a well?

Just seeing Isaac brought Aria's risqué stories to mind, making it
impossible for Luce to maintain her composure all the way to the dorm.

Aria's erotic stories were too stimulating for a girl who had barely
emerged from puberty to endure. Luce had to forcefully swallow her
desire to hear more.

"I need to rest today...!"

It wasn't a choice but a necessity. She needed to calm her excited state
immediately.

Luce desperately tried to fall asleep with her bloodshot eyes wide open.

\* \* \*

This should be enough.

Daytime, at a corner of the Butterfly Garden. I took a deep breath while
looking at the five rock pillars I had created.

I made a gun shape with my right hand and pointed my index finger at one
of the rock pillars. Then, I started the calculation to construct the
magic circle for the 7-star ice spell \[Icebolt\].

Seven pale blue magic circles were engraved in the air, all aiming at
the targets I had set.

From the direction my index finger pointed, I released \[Icebolt\].

*Boom!!*

The pale blue mana crossed the air at a lightning-fast speed.
Simultaneously, as a recoil, a cold chill exploded outward.

Beams of light were engraved in the air, and \[Icebolt\] missed the rock
pillar.

"Ah..."

As expected. Due to my lack of mastery, my accuracy was low.

I could have easily hit the target up close, but I wanted to practice
hitting targets from a distance. It was better for broadening my
tactical range.

Once more. I fired \[Icebolt\] again.

A week had passed since I returned from Hegel Magic Tower.

Through Kaya and Dorothy, I heard about what had happened while I was at
Hegel Magic Tower.

*The inevitable happened.*

An enormous incident occurred in the Horan, the Land of the Fire
Blossoms, causing an uproar across the world. The reason was the
revelation of the true priestess.

the Nation of the Land of the Fire Blossoms requested the cooperation of
the Zelver Imperial Family to capture Mei, who had deceived the nation.

Mei escaped from the hospital room, hid, and was eventually caught by
the Imperial Knights. Due to her fierce resistance, several knights were
injured.

Students nearby watched in silent agony as Mei was taken away, wailing
miserably. It was the fall of the false priestess.

Now, Mei's fate was entirely up to Miya, but considering their familial
bond, she would likely be spared the death penalty.

She would probably be sentenced to lifelong hard labor with a part of
her body removed.

It was karma. The time had come for her to pay for her merciless and
cruel deeds.

Additionally, there was a question Kaya and Dorothy both commonly asked
me.

*─ Sir Isaac, nothing special happened with Luce Eltania, right?*

*─ President, nothing happened with that stalker friend, right?*

Since nothing special happened, I replied that nothing did. After all,
Luce only helped me throughout our time at Hegel Magic Tower.

They looked at me with doubtful eyes, as if they were unsettled, but I
had nothing more to say.

Meeting Snow White after a long time, she tightly held my hand and
tearfully said, "I've missed youuu..."

Finding her absolutely adorable, I patted her head and then returned to
mentoring.

The assignment I had given before leaving... I decided that the effort
put into it was what mattered. The assignment she submitted showed signs
of hard work but lacked completeness. It seemed to have been quite
challenging to manage in two weeks.

Thanks to Amy and Mateo’s well-organized lecture notes, I had no problem
catching up with the classes I missed and quickly dealt with the backlog
of assignments.

Time passed by immensely.

One day, after classes ended, and the sun gradually set.

On the bridge across the lake in the Hydrangea Garden. I was leaning on
the railing, holding a magic tool, training my mana mastery. Someone was
waiting.

"Hey, Baby? What are you up to?"

A female student in a uniform with light gold hair popped her head out
and greeted me in a playful voice.

She was the senior who had asked me out on a date.

"Ah, Senior Alice. Just doing some additional training."

"Oh, doing a bit of everything, aren't you?"

I tucked the magic tool I was holding into my chest pocket.

"Ah, sorry I'm late. Got a bit behind on some work."

"It's okay. You arrived quickly. I haven't been here long myself."

The Student Council President, Alice Carroll, leaned one arm on the
railing and rested her chin on her hand, staring intently at me.

"...Baby, didn't you miss me?"

The sunset light reflected in Alice's eyes and hair.

For a moment, I looked into those eyes and then smiled as I spoke.

"I missed you. You always take care of me, so of course, I would."

It was a false smile.

"That's good to hear. I missed you too, Baby."

Alice let out her characteristically gentle smile.

Today was the day before 「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」.

<span id="0202_204_Black_Tea.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 204: Black Tea
======================

It was an ordinary date.

We walked through the Hydrangea Garden, ate bread, roasted meat at a
shop, laughed, and talked about silly things.

Had it not been for our hostile relationship, there would've been
nothing unusual about this date.

This afternoon, I read the psychology of a Paladin. It seemed they
already had a plan set for tomorrow.

This meant that Alice had already obtained the Phantasmal Clock, an item
that could hasten the resurrection of the Evil God. By now, that clock
would be in the hands of her minion in another world.

However, the fact that I was an enemy had not yet been finalized among
the Paladins.

Looking back on the day of the closing ceremony, it was highly likely
that Alice was convinced I was an enemy. With that being said, she
hadn’t yet informed her subordinates that I was a definitive enemy.

I wanted to talk to her. I wanted to know what Alice was really
thinking. I thought that today might be my last chance...

We reached the seashore outside the academy grounds. Alice had said that
she wanted to go there with me.

The sky was inked in darkness. Thick clouds covered it so densely that
not even the stars were visible. When the sky darkened, the rays of
light, which breached the fortress of clouds, on the ground appeared
even more beautiful. Our eyes were naturally drawn to such beauty.

As the waves swept across the sandy beach, the bioluminescent creatures
flickered their magical light. It was as if multiple auroras were
rippling through the sea. This place was abundant with invisible
luminescent creatures, similar to plankton, in the summer.

Alice took off her shoes and walked along the fine sandy beach. I
followed her, barefoot.

“The night sea here is so beautiful in the summer. That’s why I come
every year. Have you been here before, Baby?”

“No, it’s my first time. It’s beautiful.”

“If only the weather were nicer, it would’ve been perfect.”

The sky threatened to release its downpour at any moment. Alice's
expression was full of regret.

We walked along the shore, facing the sea breeze.

“…Senior Alice.”

“Yes.”

“Why did you come to Märchen Academy?”

“What a boring question. It’s just that life becomes easier after
graduating here. That’s all… What about you?”

“I came for the same reason. Though, I’m not as strong as you, Senior
Alice.”

“Hmm, I believe you underestimate your value. So, what do you want to
do, Baby?”

“I’m a wizard, but I haven’t decided on a specific path yet. What about
you? What do you want to do?”

“I want to be revered like a Queen and I wish to live happily ever after
with the person I love.”

“That’s… not really a career, is it?”

“I never asked about career, I simply asked what you want to do.”

“If that’s the case, I want something similar. To be revered like a King
and live happily ever after with the people I love. Who wouldn’t want
that?”

“People, huh…? You’re quite greedy, Baby.”

*Plop.*

A raindrop fell at the tip of my nose.

My eyes naturally drew upward. The darkened clouds were ready to fulfill
their threat.

Alice performed a similar action as the raindrops gradually intensified.

“It’s starting to rain. Should we head back?”

Alice stopped and turned towards me, extending her hand.

“Give me your hand, Baby.”

“…?”

It wasn’t a trap. She simply offered her hand.

Curious, I took Alice’s hand, and she immediately led me straight into
the sea.

“Ah!”

*Splash!*

We stepped into the water. The water glowed green and blue from our
steps.

The raindrops grew heavier. The shower turned into a downpour.

The bioluminescent creatures were stimulated every time the rain hit the
ocean, glowing brighter before slowly fading away. The scene was utterly
breathtaking.

“It’s pretty, right?”

Soon, Alice’s gold hair was drenched. Waves of beautiful colors
overlapped at our ankles yet my eyes remained fixed on her.

“Yes… very much so.”

“Do you hate the rain?”

“I like it right now.”

Alice grinned.

Her soaked shirt revealed her underwear, so I draped a thin coat over
her shoulders. Alice thanked me and closely embraced herself with the
coat I had given her.

“Look at this.”

Alice chattered while repeatedly stomping in the water. Clear light
surged from her every step.

I followed suit and light shimmered around me too.

Soon, we were both soaking wet, our clothes heavy and damp. Yet, there
was a strange sense of freedom from being completely soaked, as if I had
nothing to hide. My heart subtly trembled.

Alice playfully splashed water at me. I let out a surprised yelp, which
made her burst into laughter.

A laugh escaped my mouth as well, simply because of the fun I was
having.

We continued frolicking in the water, playfully splashing each other.

“Woah!”

I lost my balance and fell backward. My already-soaked body was
submerged in seawater.

Alice burst out laughing. Shimmers stuck to my body.

Alice approached me. At first, I thought she would offer her hand, but
she flopped down beside me, soaking herself completely in the water.

Shimmers covered our bodies. The sight was so amusing that I burst into
laughter.

“Hehe, help me up, Baby.”

“Come on.”

I took Alice’s hand and helped her up.

Her hand appeared so small compared to my callused one.

We gazed into each other's eyes and chuckled for a while.

After frolicking in the sea for a while, we entered a coastal cave. I
took out a pile of firewood from my magic pouch, activated a fire spell
scroll, and started a bonfire. We needed to warm up unless we wanted to
catch a cold.

Outside the cave, thunder rumbled occasionally in the never-ending rain.

“That was fun\~.”

Sitting by the bonfire, Alice spoke with a smile, genuinely enjoying the
moment.

I sat opposite her, basking in the warmth of the fire.

I pulled a blanket out of my magic pouch and handed it to Alice. She
smiled softly, accepting it and draping it over her shoulders.

I boiled water and brewed some black tea with the leaves I had prepared
beforehand. I handed her a cup, and she took it happily.

“When did you pack these?”

“I always carry them around. I like black tea just like you do.”

Alice sipped her black tea with a satisfied expression.

For a while after, we both remained silent, quietly watching the
crackling bonfire.

“Senior Alice.”

I poked the kindling of the bonfire, glancing at Alice. Her pinkish eyes
reflected the bonfire and my tiny figure.

“What is it, Baby?”

Her voice was still excited as if the joy was still lingering. It was a
lovely voice.

I turned my gaze back to the bonfire.

There was something I wanted to ask.

“What type of man do you like?”

Alice chuckled softly.

“Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?”

“I thought it might be me.”

Alice wanted to bring ruin to this world.

However, even someone like her had a preference in men. The Phantom Cat
Cheshire had said I was her type.

I wanted to ask because I couldn’t understand how Alice, a human with
genuine emotions, could become such an extreme villain.

Alice smiled playfully.

“...And what if it’s you? Would you date me?”

“Why not?”

She did not anticipate my calm response, and the smirk on her face
gradually faded.

I tried to probe into Alice’s inner feelings with that answer. I wanted,
no, needed to confirm her humanity.

Although I felt a bit guilty for exploiting someone’s feelings…

…Tomorrow, we’d become adversaries destined to kill each other. I judged
that probing into her true feelings was of utmost importance.

Alice seemed to ponder for a moment before asking an unexpected
question.

“Baby.”

“Yes?”

“Do you have more blankets?”

“I have two extra.”

“Then, shall we sleep here?”

“...Huh?”

*…What?*

I looked at Alice. I thought she was joking to avoid an embarrassing
conversation, but her face was serious.

Suddenly, Alice placed the cup of tea, the blankets, and the coat on the
ground, and then stood up.

She stood next to me, her underwear still damp.

Then, placing her hands on the ground, she leaned in close to me.

“Senior…?”

I reflexively pulled back, and she leaned in even closer.

Thinking that she might be seizing the opportunity to catch me off
guard, I covered her hands on the ground with mine.

Alice glanced at my hand, then looked back into my eyes.

An odd tension filled the air as Alice was poised like she was about to
pounce on me, but I had no choice but to keep her in check.

And so, our eyes locked into each other mere inches apart.

“Isaac.”

Alice whispered.

“Would it be okay if you stayed the night with me?”

Time seemed to come to a halt.

Only the crackling of the bonfire continued to prove that time was still
moving.

“...Why?”

“Nothing… I just want you to.”

I couldn’t fully grasp Alice’s intention. What was she thinking, and
with what feelings did she say that?

What was clear was that I couldn’t show any vulnerability. Even her
seduction was ultimately for the sole purpose of killing me.

To Alice, my appearance represented an archwizard capable of destroying
the world.

A formidable enemy and the highest obstacle she would have to overcome.

Therefore, it was an offer I couldn’t accept.

I lowered my gaze.

Ultimately… I concluded that it would be difficult to know Alice’s true
feelings.

Blinking softly and smiling kindly, I looked back at her.

“...Alice, save such proposals for when you truly fall in love with
someone.”

It was just an excuse.

But considering Alice’s rash behavior in suggesting we spend the night
together, it was also the most appropriate response.

At that, Alice’s eyes narrowed. Her seductive expression faded.

“You’re quite firm. How boring.”

“I get that a lot.”

Mostly from the girl with a witch hat.

“Let’s dry off our clothes and head back. The rain seems to have
stopped.”

“...Sure.”

Alice pulled away from me and got up.

We looked at the cave entrance. The sound of the rain had indeed
stopped.

Soon after, we gathered our things and exited the cave. For a while,
Alice didn’t say anything. So, we returned to the academy without
uttering a single word.

Only the streetlights quietly illuminated the academy grounds. No
students were roaming around at such a late hour.

Alice stopped outside Bartos Hall.

“I had fun today, Baby. Get home safe.”

“Huh? Senior, aren’t you going inside?”

“I still have things to do.”

“Ah, that must be tough…”

I waved my hand goodbye. Smiling one last time.

“Then, I’ll see you tomorrow, Senior.”

“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”

After parting with Alice, I headed to my dorm. She entered Bartos Hall.

As I walked, I looked back at Bartos Hall.

The light inside the student council room never lit up.

\* \* \*

**\[*Meow.*** **Why didn’t you try to kill Isaac?\]**

As soon as Alice Carroll entered the student council room, her fat
purple cat familiar, Phantom Cat Cheshire, revealed itself.

In the darkness, the magic beast’s body remained unseen.

**\[Even if Isaac is strong, shouldn’t you have found a way to kill him?
Why, oh why, didn’t you kill Isaac?\]**

“…”

Alice quietly made herself a cup of black tea and sat down in the
presidential seat with her steaming cup.

She sipped her black tea.

“Our goal is to resurrect the Evil God. Everything will end tomorrow
anyway.”

**\[*Meow!*** **That’s right, tomorrow is going to be reeeally fun, so
it doesn’t matter! Hehe!\]**

The Phantom Cat became visible again and sat on the President’s desk,
its mouth tearing into a long, grotesque smile.

**\[But, why did you do that?\]**

“Do what?”

**\[Did you want some comfort from Isaac before the fight? Since he’ll
become an enemy tomorrow and today’s relationship will end completely?
It doesn’t seem like something someone who’s about to end this world
should be thinking, right?\]**

“...You’re being ridiculous.”

Alice responded calmly.

“It was just for fun, one last bit of amusement.”

The Phantom Cat chuckled and began to fade away like smoke.

**\[I see. So that’s it. I’m looking forward to it. I can’t wait to see
the expression on Isaac’s face when our dear Alice resurrects the Evil
God tomorrow. I’m really excited. Please, don’t disappoint me,
Alice.\]**

The Phantom Cat vanished.

Alice watched the place where it disappeared, then she gently fiddled
with the choker around her neck.

There were numerous scratches. She could feel the rough texture.

She turned her chair to look out the window. Between the clouds, a moon
the size of a palm peeked out. She slowly sipped her tea while gazing at
that scene.

After finishing her black tea, she got up to brew another cup.

Her eyes, now accustomed to the darkness, peered into the tea leaf
container. It was empty.

*So that was the last one.*

Alice muttered to herself as she put down the empty cup.

<span id="0203_205_Alice_Subjugation_1.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 205: Alice Subjugation (1)
==================================

A cool night breeze blew in. It was after a thunderstorm had drenched
the island.

Upon arriving at the dorm, I washed up. Then, after slightly covering
the lamp on the desk to dim the light, I took out a silver dagger from
the magic pouch. It was the Blade of Frost Flowers.

I scanned the magic circle engraved on the blade. As Hilde had said,
this dagger was not something I could handle easily.

Because it was the key to the ritual that summoned all the combat forces
of Düpfendorf.

This dagger was imbued with their will to make me their king.

Düpfendorf. An ice kingdom founded on the harsh land where blizzards
rage incessantly. I knew that nation-destroying ice magic beasts, which
I had only seen in the settings book, called that place home.

To use the Dagger of Frost Flowers meant to take on the troops of
Düpfendorf and those nation-destroying ice magic beasts. First off, the
amount of mana consumed in summoning them would be tremendous. In other
words, I had to be as strong as the primordial ice sovereign.

As of now, I wouldn't be able to use it unless my unique skill
\[Hunter\] was activated.

Suddenly, many thoughts covered my mind.

My memories from the first round were blurry. I couldn't know if I had
received Düpfendorf's help then.

*But, all that matters is who I am now.*

The obvious fact was that I now had more forces at my disposal. In this
journey to confront the Evil God, such an army was invaluable.

What came to mind next was Alice Carroll. I still couldn't read her
inner thoughts. But... doubts remained.

“Choker…”

It was visible every time we met. The marks on the choker Alice always
wore around her neck were gradually increasing.

At first, it wasn’t noticeable unless one looked at it closely, but as
the day of our destined battle approached, the frequency worsened. Just
earlier, in the coastal cave, she came close enough for me to fully take
in everything I needed to see.

Since I couldn't see Alice's choker in detail in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, it was a fact I hadn't realized before.

Initially, I thought it was because Alice was mentally unwell.

Whether it was during「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」in ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱, or during the Trial of Frost, Alice showed a psychopathic
side. I thought that might be her true nature. It was not without reason
that there were rumors on forums about Alice being a regressor. The
setting where one went mad from repeated regression was quite common.

Moreover, in the game, Phantom Cat Cheshire remarked that Alice's heart
was pitch black. Being her familiar, it would naturally know its master
best, and yet, Cheshire faithfully believed in and followed Alice’s
ambition for world destruction.

Everything pointed to Alice’s true nature being evil…

Thus, it wasn't strange to assume that she scratched her choker due to
mental defects and anxiety.

I had thought the image Alice showed me was all an act.

*But is that correct?*

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Amy Holloway used the spell \[Heart Color
Discernment\] on White and became skeptical about the true darkness of
her heart.

That made the player feel anxious that White might be abnormal, but it
later turned out to be a clue indicating the demon, The Abyss.

*What if Alice is similar?*

The dramatic psychological change Alice showed during the Alice
Subjugation…

*…Was it really her revealing her true self?*

Unfortunately, I had no way of confirming if that was true or not.

The image of Alice from earlier just didn't leave my mind.

I looked out the window. The capricious night wind kept brushing against
my skin.

The clouds cleared, and a faintly shining moon appeared. Though obscured
by dark clouds at times, the moon just kept orbiting in the same place
every day.

When that obvious fact suddenly came to mind, I thought of something
that had to be done.

*Ssshk.*

I sheathed the Blade of Frost Flowers again. Calming my emotions, I
quietly looked at the dagger.

Now, what I needed was resolve.

\* \* \*

Seed Spreading Day.

It was a special day mentioned in the scripture of the Helize church,
known as the day when the Lord Manhalla scattered the seeds of blessing
to promise humans a prosperous life.

On this day, it was customary for the Helize Church to offer prayers of
thanks to the Lord Manhalla.

Perhaps because of the downpour last night, the sky was clearer than
ever.

Before long, the sky had turned navy blue.

The Märchen Academy plaza was filled with faculty and students in
uniform. Around the plaza, the academy's combat forces and the imperial
knights were on guard.

On the stage with an altar, the priests and members of the Helize church
were conducting a religious ceremony.

During this, a few faculty members were muttering under their breath.

“Why us too…”

“It's the Headmistress order.”

“Exactly, why would she make such an order.”

Since the academy administration needed to continue uninterrupted,
including on Seed Spreading Day, it wasn’t out of the ordinary to only
leave essential personnel in Bartos Hall, regardless of the event.

They were to perform their roles and offer prayers personally. Only
students were obligated to attend this event in its entirety.

However, for some reason, Headmistress Elena Woodline had ordered all
staff, except for a few security personnel, to attend the event in
advance.

This event would take at least 2 hours. Only the current night shift
workers, who had to brace for a backlog of work due to the 2-hour
administrative gap, could understandably harbor grievances.

Meanwhile, Princess Snow White, standing among the students, was
harboring doubts.

*Senior Isaac is missing…*

Isaac was nowhere to be seen.

Despite the large number of students, they were organized by faculty and
year, so she only needed to check the area for the second-year students
in the Magic Department. Sneakily glancing around, but she only ended up
making some unrelated male students blush. There was no sign of Isaac
anywhere.

There were several attempts on her life by her mother.

These were not moments she simply endured indifferently. The sharpness
forged by her survival instinct played a significant role.

And that peculiar sensation was stirring the same unease at this current
moment.

It was because of events that day.

*─ White, could you lend me that watch?*

After mentoring ended earlier in the day, she had lent Isaac the
platinum pocket watch. It was a small watch she had received as a gift
from her mother.

The abnormal phenomenon occurring in the watch was getting worse, and
now the entire face was on the verge of turning pitch black. Isaac had
said he had a guess about the phenomenon and wanted to borrow the watch
for just one day to analyze the definitive cause.

It was a watch with special significance. She regarded it as her
mother's only gift unrelated to the assassination attempts. Therefore,
she preferred it if it didn’t pass through anyone else's hands, but if
Isaac could discover the cause of the anomaly, White thought she could
manage the rest and repair it, so she decided it would be okay to
entrust the watch to him for a day.

*But…*

From time to time, Isaac had casually mentioned he was investigating the
cause of the phenomenon appearing in the watch.

He claimed it was out of interest in the intriguing phenomenon, but was
that really the reason?

She thought back to Isaac during the joint practical evaluation.

Isaac had momentarily hardened his expression upon seeing White's watch.
White had pretended not to notice, but it seemed he knew something.

*Why did you make that expression, Senior Isaac?*

Isaac was a senior known for his deep consideration and vast knowledge;
he was a reliable ally who always looked out for White’s wellbeing.

Therefore, White felt a strong sense of unease at that time.

The timing was perfect, as Isaac, a model student, was absent from an
event that all students were required to attend.

If there was a mechanism in that watch capable of killing, and the
darkening of the dial pitch black was a sign of its activation?

What if it turned out that the watch was a sort of assassination device
made by magic?

Perhaps Isaac already knew what the abnormal phenomenon occurring in the
watch was?

Perhaps he spared White the knowledge, certain that something
unspeakable was about to happen?

Could it be that the demonic spirit of her mother, who had already lost
her life, extended to even the academy?

*No, it couldn’t be… It can’t be.*

*Let’s not entertain such fantasies.*

It mustn’t be so. White fervently hoped it was just her misconception.

Eventually, the event reached its final stage.

Followers, centered around Saintess Bianca Anturaze, reached the front
of the altar. Wearing a pure white veil and holy garments, the saintly
robe that enveloped Bianca's entire body gave off an impression of
purity and mystery, like untrodden snow.

As Bianca knelt in front of the altar, everyone bowed their heads and
clasped their hands.

Silence pervaded.

*Lord Manhalla, your humble servant offers a prayer.*

Bianca began to pray on behalf of everyone. Her voice spread through the
loudspeakers.

*In the past, you entrusted the future to us.*

Headmistress Elena Woodline looked out the window from the top floor of
Orphin Hall, the Magic Department's lecture building, with a tense
expression.

Her eyes stayed fixed on Bartos Hall, a palace-like building and the hub
of academic administration.

In that room, Hegel Tower Master Aria Lilias sipped tea while sitting on
a sofa.

*You have sown the seeds of blessing in this land, promising us a life
of abundance.*

A powerful barrier began to unfold along the outer walls of Bartos Hall.

Injured security personnel hurried out of the building. They were
following Headmistress Elena's prior instructions to prioritize escape
and avoid combat should any incident occur.

They reported to the Headmistress as messengers.

“A traitor has emerged! Student Council President, Alice Carroll! Alice
Carroll!! That student is the culprit! We need backup immediately!”

***A traitor has appeared.***

Headmistress Elena Woodline narrowed her eyes.

*Our prosperity was solely due to the divine grace of the Lord.*

Somewhere in the academy, the Trump Paladins moved in unison, leading
their troops.

Following the orders of Alice Carroll, they took their positions
throughout the academy.

*We follow the Lord and give thanks.*

Suddenly, the clouds in the sky began to swirl around Bartos Hall.
Beneath them, a dark violet magical circle traced its path.

Subsequently, a translucent golden barrier, constructed of time magic,
unfolded atop Bartos Hall.

*Allow us to praise you eternally...*

*GUUUUUUUUUU!!!*

The prayer Saintess Bianca was chanting was swallowed by a
ground-shaking roar.

Bianca stopped praying. No one questioned the sudden cessation of her
prayer.

Everyone's gaze turned towards Bartos Hall, right after a sinister mana
had descended upon the academy.

A monster's head emerged from the magic circle in the sky. As the
creature pulled its entire body out of the circle, the figure of a
massive dragon became visible.

“What is that?”

“A dragon…?”

Sharp reptilian claws.

Large wings enveloped in reddish purple fire mana.

Sturdy-looking scales.

An 8-star black dragon magic beast, the Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock,
roared as its four eyes gleamed.

**\[GRAAAAAAHH!!\]**

People in the plaza held their breath and froze at the sight.

The imperial knights, initially stunned by its overwhelming presence,
quickly drew their swords, ready for combat.

Fear spread throughout the plaza.

While everyone was attending the Seed Spreading Day event, someone had
taken over Bartos Hall. It was clear to everyone in the plaza that their
intentions were malicious.

A terrorist attack had unfolded at the academy.

At that moment.

*Chalang!*

*KWAAAAANG!!*

**\[GRAAAAGH!!\]**

A brilliantly shining starlight explosion enveloped the Nightmare Dragon
Jabberwock.

Soon after, a female student wearing a witch's hat appeared around the
dragon, surrounded by a swarm of stars, as if she had anticipated this
very situation.

It was Dorothy Heartnova.

Dorothy unfolded a rainbow-colored magic circle and emitted several rays
of starlight. The beams attempted to break the golden barrier deployed
on the rooftop of Bartos Hall but dissipated as soon as they touched it
as if they were completely blocked.

It didn't even feel like they were being blocked; it seemed as though
the attack was completely shut down at its source.

“It’s not breaking through…!”

Dorothy, with her witch's hat firmly on, surveyed the rooftop of Bartos
Hall. She could see a huge golden magic circle filling the rooftop
beyond the translucent barrier, and Alice Carroll standing in the middle
of it.

It seemed as if she was praying to a god. As if it was not the time to
be concerned about Dorothy, Alice took out a peculiar pocket watch,
which floated in mid-air and emitted a golden mana.

After that, an otherworldly monolith slowly took shape.

A forbidden magic that defied truth. A cornerstone for invoking a 9-star
time-acceleration spell, \[Obelisk of Eternity\].

“You’ve finally shown your true nature, Alice!!”

A smile spread across Dorothy's lips.

*So, that’s the Phantasmal Clock.*

The Phantasmal Clock was an object found and kept by Alice’s minion in
another world, and destroying it was Isaac's primary goal.

Isaac had said during the strategy meeting that there was a great risk
of not even getting a look at the clock if they attacked when Alice
hadn't taken out the Phantasmal Clock. It would have been futile.

This meant that from the moment Alice took out the Phantasmal Clock…

…Dorothy was free to strike down the “villain” Alice however she saw
fit.

However, Isaac had entrusted Dorothy with the role of keeping the
academy safe while restraining the Nightmare Dragon. She wanted to
quickly defeat the giant dragon and move on to take down Alice.

Dorothy continuously deployed rainbow-colored magic circles.

*Whooooosh!*

*KUUUUUH!*

Struck by the starlight beam, the Nightmare Dragon, in agony, retaliated
by spewing a broad expanse of reddish-purple flames.

To protect the academy, Dorothy deployed a large starlight barrier to
block the flames.

**\[Meowww!\]**

Then, from behind Dorothy, a chubby purple cat familiar, Phantom Cat
Cheshire, appeared.

Dorothy turned her head back and stared blankly at the Phantom Cat. The
Phantom Cat smiled creepily, its grin split ear to ear.

**\[Hello, Dorothy.\]**

“Hello, fatty.”

**\[I wish you wouldn’t interfere.\]**

“Nihihi, what nonsense are you spouting?”

It was just as Isaac had said. Facing the Nightmare Dragon might mean
dealing with someone like Phantom Cat Cheshire.

Regardless, the task at hand remained unchanged.

With her gaze fixed on the Phantom Cat, Dorothy extended her arm towards
the Nightmare Dragon. Gradually, her hand grasped at the empty air.

A swarm of stars mercilessly swirled around the Nightmare Dragon. At the
same time, with a crashing sound, gravity intensified from every
direction and attempted to crush the Nightmare Dragon.

Had it been an ordinary creature, it would have instantly crumpled like
a crushed can, but the sturdy-bodied Nightmare Dragon fiercely roared
and resisted.

Beneath Dorothy's witch hat, from the shadowed corners of her eyes,

Mysterious-colored pupils gleamed with an inner light.

“Somebody’s going to die today.”

With a smile, Dorothy glared at Cheshire.

"Sir Isaac, the enemies have dispersed."

I was hiding, holding my breath with Kaya Astrea, at a location some
distance away from Bartos Hall.

Since the Phantom Cat Cheshire had cast detection magic in the area in
advance, we couldn’t stay close to Bartos Hall and decided to move with
minimal personnel just in case.

So, we were secretly hiding in a spot untouched by the Phantom Cat
Cheshire’s detection magic, biding our time.

Since the academy's combat forces and the Imperial knights were bound to
converge, the Trump Paladins and their troops intended to defend Bartos
Hall.

In the game, depending on which route one took toward Bartos Hall, you’d
face different mid-bosses. However, we had no intention of wasting time
on such foes.

I looked up at the sky. As expected, Phantom Cat Cheshire had begun to
engage Dorothy alongside the Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock.

Dorothy was a formidable opponent. Even a powerful familiar like the
Nightmare Dragon wouldn’t be enough to stop Dorothy, so Alice had the
Phantom Cat join in as well.

With Chesire focused on its own fight, I activated \[Clairvoyance\] to
survey Bartos Hall. Fortunately, there were no casualties.

In the Alice Subjugation of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, Alice killed all
the staff remaining in Bartos Hall because they were in the way. After
that, Alice showed a dramatic change, becoming a psychopath who enjoyed
killing.

To prevent such a shitty scenario, I had asked Aria Lilias, the Hegel
Tower Master, to ensure Bartos Hall was emptied during the Seed
Spreading Day event.

She relayed my request to the academy's Headmistress, Elena Woodline, as
a request from the Nameless Hero.

Thanks to her, all the staff remaining in Bartos Hall attended the Seed
Spreading Day event and avoided death.

"Let's go."

"Yes, Sir Isaac."

Kaya and I began to move together.

The destination was Bartos Hall, the palace-like building at the center
of Märchen Academy, now occupied by Alice.

Chapter 206: Alice Subjugation (2)
==================================

The final boss of 「Act 9, Chapter 3, The Queen of Hearts」of ❰Magic
Knight of Märchen❱, was the Heart Queen - Alice.

She used her minions to search for the Phantasmal Clock in Wonderland.

The beginning of 「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」of ❰Magic Knight of
Märchen❱ was marked by Alice finding the clock and revealing her
identity as the informant by taking over Bartos Hall.

As seen in the Trial of Frost, the Phantasmal Clock was the catalyst for
activating the 9-star time-acceleration spell \[Obelisk of Eternity\].

Its purpose was the early revival of the Evil God. Today, Alice intended
to resurrect the Evil God.

However, unlike during the trial, the \[Obelisk of Eternity\] had not
yet been activated. Alice had only begun constructing the \[Obelisk of
Eternity\].

Since the Phantasmal Clock would be used as a catalyst, it was time to
make a move.

If Alice were apprehended before she even had the chance to reveal the
Phantasmal Clock, I wouldn’t have known what would become of it.

Moreover, she was prepared to commit suicide if she was cornered. I had
to wait until she deployed the barrier and brought out the Phantasmal
Clock.

So, it began.

In the game, I had to face both Alice and the Nightmare Dragon at the
same time, but with Dorothy taking on the Dragon, it wouldn’t be an
issue.

Meaning, if I could quickly destroy the Phantasmal Clock and prevent
Alice from activating the \[Obelisk of Eternity\], it would be my
victory.

As a side note, just like when Vera the Summoner was defeated, EXP was
shared between the master and the familiar. By defeating Alice, we could
also share in the EXP from creatures like the Nightmare Dragon and the
Phantom Cat.

“Isaac, what is that?”

“It’s Alice Carroll’s familiar and her minions.”

I reached the vicinity of Bartos Hall with Kaya. We hid behind a tree to
scout the building.

Like the rooftop, a strong golden barrier was deployed along the
exterior walls of the palace-like Bartos Hall to prevent the building
from collapsing.

The arched doorways remained untouched.

Like in the Trial of Frost, the only route to get inside Bartos Hall was
to climb up to the roof.

It was like retracing the route that Alice had planned to use as an
escape. After activating the \[Obelisk of Eternity\], she planned to
leave Bartos Hall and engage in battle herself.

Though I referred to it as an escape route, it was a straightforward
route.

And in front of the building.

Numerous foot soldiers were lined up in front of Bartos Hall.

Positioned as their leader was the gray dragon, Tiger Dragon
Bandersnatch. It was a grotesque beast with a massive head that
resembled a tiger, jaws that seemed capable of crushing anything, and a
long neck.

Atop the spire, a giant bird with red wings, the Jubjub Bird, was
scanning the surroundings.

They were all minions that Alice had contracted upon acquiring the
authority of the Queen of Hearts.

\[Bandersnatch\] **Lv:** 167 **Race:** Magic Beast **Elements:** Rock
**Danger:** Highest **Psychology:** \[Intends to dismember any intruder
it may encounter and scatter their entrails.\] \[Jujub Bird\] **Lv:**
156 **Race:** Magic Beast **Elements:** Wind **Danger:** High
**Psychology:** \[Intends to snatch intruders and drop them into the
sea\]

The Tiger Dragon, Bandersnatch, was the final boss of Act 9, Chapter 1,
and along with the Jubjub Bird, all the foot soldiers were its
subordinate mobs.

In the game, they were known for their troublesome offensive tactics.

“Kaya, I’ll say it again, but I’m not forcing you. Can you do it?”

Kaya nodded as if it were a matter of course.

“If it’s your order, I’ll do anything. I’ll bring them all down.”

Kaya’s eyes turned bloodshot as the power of Dark Kaya manifested.

I couldn’t help but wonder if her loyalty was a bit too fervent.

“...Don’t overdo it.”

Anyway.

It would take quite a while for Kaya to withstand their onslaught or
defeat them all.

Especially since the Tiger Dragon Bandersnatch, boasted high defense and
tenacious vitality. Alice didn’t make him the gatekeeper for nothing.

Thus, I had already informed Kaya that I wouldn’t join the fight and
would instead head to the rooftop of Bartos Hall to stop Alice.

I told her that there was something I needed to confirm about Alice and
that we needed to talk alone.

Alice had fully revealed her identity as the informant. There was
nothing left to hide from each other.

Heading to the rooftop of Bartos Hall alone would be the last chance for
us to truly open up to one another

*It might be foolish.*

From the start… there was a fundamental issue. The fact that I would be
of little use to Kaya against the enemies guarding Bartos Hall. There
was a huge spec difference.

Against humans, my stats significantly increased thanks to \[vs. Human
Combat Power\], and I could somewhat manage legendary weapons.

But I couldn’t count on that against those guarding the entrance of
Bartos Hall.

If there was a power that could not only exploit the weaknesses of
demons but also overcome drastic spec differences with destructive
force, like Divine Power the story would be different… but that was a
privilege of our protagonist, Ian Fairytale, so it was out of the
question for someone like Isaac.

Moreover, reinforcements were definitely coming. Until then, I was
confident that I could stall for time, even against Alice.

The most critical issue was whether I could prevent the activation of
the \[Obelisk of Eternity\] within that time frame.

As I was pondering, Kaya suddenly kissed me on the cheek.

I looked at Kaya in surprise. She smiled lovingly and whispered.

“What are you thinking about, my dear Isaac?”

I read her psychology. It seemed she kissed me on purpose, seeing me
lost in thought.

“I’ll see you after it’s over.”

“...Yeah, let’s meet afterward. If it seems dangerous, run away
immediately.”

“Understood!”

Kaya, wrapping herself with wind, charged toward Bartos Hall.

The Tiger Dragon Bandersnatch and the Jubjub Bird frumiously roared and
simultaneously attacked Kaya. Numerous foot soldiers charged at her with
spears in hand.

In the meantime, I sneaked toward the entrance of Bartos Hall.

Kaya, using the joint spell \[Baphomet’s Hymn\], slashed through the
enemies, drawing their attention to herself. The defeated foot soldiers
vanished as if they were summoned back.

I felt a sense of dissonance upon seeing that sight.

*Reverse summoning?*

In such cases, it was common for the summoned minions to be healed
immediately after being summoned back.

In war, there was no such thing as a waste of forces. It wasn’t a bad
choice. It was a strategic decision for preserving forces, as it allowed
one to save minions.

However, this scene did not align with my memory.

In the game or during the Trial of Frost, the foot soldiers were used
until their demise.

Alice was in a life-or-death situation this time. Yet, why was she
sparing her minions? I couldn’t comprehend it.

*…Let’s go inside, for now.*

I had to set aside my unanswered questions for the time being. I didn’t
have much time.

While Kaya drew the enemies’ attention, I crept inside Bartos Hall.

\* \* \*

There existed another dimension known as Wonderland.

Many children end up falling into this world by accident.

The reasons were mostly similar.

First, they often dreamt of adventures in another world, only to forget
about it completely later on.

Then, one day, they actually encountered a mystical animal or something
from their suddenly remembered dreams, and while chasing after it…

They inadvertently fell into Wonderland.

It was a regrettable misfortune that befell the unlucky children who
resonated with Wonderland.

Some children lost their lives upon reaching Wonderland.

Some children went crazy upon reaching Wonderland.

After all, it was a world filled entirely with beings of mad minds.

Alice Carroll said she chased after an animal, a rabbit dressed in a
suit, which was running in a hurry. Her curiosity was piqued by the fact
that he looked at his watch and muttered to himself about being late.

Thus, by chasing the mysterious rabbit, she fell down a rabbit hole,
passed through a passageway with floating furniture and musical
instruments, ate food that made her grow or shrink and went through a
small door to reach Wonderland.

There, Alice beheaded the tyrannical Queen of Hearts, seizing her power.

She obtained the Vorpal Sword and fought with the Nightmare Dragon,
Jabberwock, defeating him.

Alice also occasionally found humans who had fallen into Wonderland like
herself and gathered them under her command.

The Spade Paladin never forgot the moment he was saved by her.

There was a stir.

The man with black hair, who had been drifting through the past, slowly
opened his eyes.

A lavish and spacious hallway adorned with a red carpet.

Ornate chandeliers flickered as powerful magical forces clashed from
every direction outside the building.

He was dressed in a neat black uniform with blue trimmings and wore a
tidy military cap. Behind his shaded glasses, his calm gaze reflected a
man standing across from him.

It was a silver-blue-haired male student.

“I didn’t expect you to come alone.”

The black-haired man, the Spade Paladin, spoke. His voice was deep.

Isaac, the silver-blue-haired man with Zhonya’s Staff slung over his
shoulders, read the status window of the Spade Paladin.

\[Zenon\] **Lv:** 170 **Race:** Human **Elements:** Ice, Lightning
**Danger:** Highest **Psychology:** \[Intends to harm you.\]

One of Alice Carroll’s subordinates and the strongest Paladin.

The mid-boss of Act 9, Chapter 2.

The Spade Paladin, Zenon.

Isaac had used \[Clairvoyance\] to survey the interior of Bartos Hall
and discovered Zenon’s presence.

The Phantom Cat, Cheshire, was originally meant to be the final boss of
Act 9, Chapter 2, but he went to confront Dorothy, so Zenon and Alice
were the only enemies remaining in Bartos Hall.

As mentioned before, there was something Isaac needed to find out from
Alice. To do this, he intended to talk with her alone.

His mind told him it was stubbornness.

*But so what?*

It didn’t matter what it was. In this journey to defeat the Evil God,
Isaac had no intention of leaving even the slightest bit of unease
unaddressed.

Therefore, to meet Alice, he would have to get past the Spade Paladin
blocking his path.

With \[vs. Human Combat Power\] and his elemental ultimate weapons,
Isaac thought he could handle it.

Any semblance of Zenon as his junior from the academy was gone. Now, he
appeared as an adult man older than Isaac.

It was Zenon’s true form, unmasked.

“Are you here to interfere?”

“If interfering means stopping Alice, then yes.”

“Are you the Nameless Hero?”

“Who knows.”

Isaac shrugged his shoulders.

Zenon blinked slowly and let out a deep sigh.

“It doesn’t matter. If that’s your purpose, I have no choice but to kill
you.”

“Can you at least tell me why you’re doing this?”

“I have no words for a dead man.”

Zenon took off his glasses.

“Good, I’m glad that the talking is over.”

Isaac followed suit.

Zenon tugged at the black gloves on his hands. From the back of his
hand, the symbol of the Ace of Spades glowed brightly through the
gloves.

Soon, deep blue mana condensed in front of him, taking on the form of a
black sword, Tachi.

He gripped the Tachi with his gloved hand.

It was the magic weapon of the magic knight Zenon, “Zacula”.

*Waaah!*

As Zenon lightly swung the Tachi, a gust whipped through his hair and
clothes.

Frost crept along the blade, and ice crystals began to form.

*Whoosh!*

Isaac struck Zhonya’s Staff on the ground, drawing forth mana. A chill
radiated from him, frosting over the corridor.

Neither man hesitated.

Zenon, gripping the handle of his Tachi with both hands, slammed the
ground and lunged towards Isaac.

In response, Isaac quickly unleashed a pale blue magic circle at Zenon.

<span id="0205_207_Alice_Subjugation_3.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 207: Alice Subjugation (3)
==================================

It was an emergency.

The academy and the Imperial Knights never expected a terrorist attack,
much less one orchestrated by students of the academy.

To be precise, all those students were undoubtedly on the side of the
terrorists.

The Imperial Knights rode horses or their familiars toward Bartos Hall
to stop the attack.

The Imperial Knights tensed up as their caution spiked. Some of them
briefly exchanged words to calm their nerves.

"I don't know either. But from my experience, if it's a type of magic
that no one has heard of and uses such a frightening amount of mana...
it's definitely extremely dangerous."

Eventually, the Imperial Knights had to come to a halt as the Clover
Paladin, Pierre Flanche, and numerous Trump soldiers blocked their path.

Pierre, in uniform, had the appearance of a mature adult man rather than
a student.

It was the moment it was revealed that the students who carried out this
terror had infiltrated the academy disguised as young-looking
individuals.

The Imperial Knights drew their swords and charged toward their enemies
without hesitation.

In another direction, Diamond Paladin Alexa led her own platoon of Trump
soldiers. She confronted the combat forces of Märchen Academy
approaching Bartos Hall.

The academy plaza was a cauldron of panic. To protect them, dozens of
wizards set up barriers, and faculty, who had received prior
instructions from the Headmistress, led the people in the plaza to
shelters.

However, some students did not follow the directions of the faculty.

"Hey! What are you doing not evacuating quickly?!"

"Isaac, Isaac, where are you…?"

Luce Eltania pushed through the fleeing students and moved in the
opposite direction.

Isaac had been missing for a while now. Despite her keen eyesight, she
could not see him anywhere.

Isaac was always at the center of trouble. He was, after all, the
Nameless Hero.

By now, he would be heading towards Bartos Hall where the terror had
occurred. The timing was certain. He missed a mandatory academy event,
suggesting he had likely foreseen this situation unfolding.

Luce inferred this and summoned Thunderbird - Gallia.

In an instant, thunderclouds covered the sky. With a loud crash, purple
thunder rumbled, and from the black clouds, a massive black grouse
revealed his majestic presence.

It was Thunderbird - Gallia, an 8-star lightning elemental magic beast.

Gallia landed near Luce, who was running past the students. The people
around were startled and ran away from the magic beast.

"Student Luce!"

"What, what are you trying to do?! Stop right now…! Ack!"

When the faculty and Imperial Knights tried to stop Luce, she swung
water magic around her to prevent anyone from approaching.

As Galia lowered his body, Luce climbed on top.

"Galia, over there! Isaac might be there!"

**\[Understood!\]**

Isaac's power might be conditional. If that assumption proved to be
true, it was imperative to protect him.

Even if it wasn’t, Luce wanted to be by Isaac's side. She had to be. If
Isaac were even slightly injured, she would feel as though her heart was
being ripped to shreds.

It was an undeniable attachment. Luce cherished that feeling.

Galia, carrying Luce, flew towards Bartos Hall.

*Whirrr!*

"Ugh?!"

Luce and the Thunderbird, overly focused on Isaac amidst their worries,
were slow to notice the bombardment.

A deep pink fireball flew at high speed, attacking Galia’s wing. With a
fierce explosion, one of Galia’s wings caught on fire. It was a flame
with a high density of mana.

Despite the searing pain, Galia remained unmoved and flapped his wings
to disperse the flames.

Numerous forces appeared in the sky and on the ground, blocking Luce and
Galia. They were Trump soldiers riding winged horses.

Then, a cute-looking woman, who had fired flames at the Thunderbird from
the ground, mounted her familiar and took the lead, flying high into the
sky.

A red horse clad in armor, striding through the air with deep pink
flames at its hooves. The person mounted on the magic beast was none
other than the Heart Paladin, Shera Hectolica.

As she reached the front of the Trump soldiers and deployed a fire magic
circle, Luce set up a lightning magic circle and stood guard.

"We meet again?"

"..."

Luce scrutinized Shera. She was in a red uniform, unlike when she was a
student. Although still youthful in appearance, she seemed more mature
than during the joint practical evaluation.

"I'm sorry, what can I do? No one can pass through here!"

"Move aside."

"I said no."

Luce's gaze chilled.

Many people were converging in their direction. As per the emergency
instructions, they were the quickly-formed combat forces and Imperial
Knights.

Somehow, several students, including Ian Fairytale, Tristan Humphrey,
and Mateo Jordana also formed a team and secretly followed the adults.
They were students united by the single-minded intention to protect the
academy

They all fought against the Trump soldiers.

Shera thought that she was just buying time anyway.

It was okay. All she needed to do was hold on just a tiny bit longer.
Until Alice revived the Evil God. Then it would be their victory.

It wouldn't take much time.

*Even if I die in the process... it doesn't matter.*

For Alice, Shera was ready to lay down her life.

From the moment she was saved by Alice in Wonderland…

The other paladins felt the same. Amidst their somber mood, only Shera
made an effort to appear cheerful. She thought they had come too far to
let their spirits fall.

But now, she had to kill her emotions.

*For the kingdom... no, to protect Alice Carroll, who had saved her.*

"Who gave the order?"

"Our Queen."

"So you enrolled with this purpose from the beginning."

"Yes, we too have something to protect."

Luce did not hide her disgust.

*Bzzzzzz!*

She figured it would be fine to suppress an enemy of the academy.

Thinking this, Luce extended her left arm forward and unleashed
lightning mana.

"...?"

Shera was surprised. The mana she felt from Luce was much stronger than
during the joint practical evaluation.

Luce's lightning mana surged. The magic weapon on her left ring finger,
the Ring of the Abyssal Queen, amplified her power.

*Did she not use her full strength when we fought last time?*

Amused by the thought, Shera scoffed.

At the same time, her heart faced in anticipation. If this was to be her
final battlefield, how thrilling would it be to face such an
unreasonably powerful genius with all her might?

"I don't care about your circumstances."

Luce's sarcastic voice settled.

Whatever their reasons might be, it all came at the expense of others.

"It wouldn't be worth listening to.

"What matters is that you stood in my way. That... I cannot forgive."

"Then try to kill me, Luce Eltania!"

Excited, Shera summoned the red knight minion “Heart Jack”, who was
entrusted to her by Alice, along with deep pink flames.

*Boom!!*

Massive flames and lightning collided, causing a series of explosions.

Luce and Shera, riding their familiars, flew around casting elemental
magic at each other.

*Kooooh!!*

Shera's flames spread in every direction. Fireballs fell like rain on
the academy's combat forces, Imperial Knights, and Ian Fairytale's
group, who were advancing toward Bartos Hall.

They were just debris tossed about in the battle. Though getting hit
would cause injuries, dealing with it was straightforward. The academy's
combat forces and Imperial Knights dodged, cut through, or eliminated
the falling fireballs even as they fought against the Trump soldiers.

Mateo Jordana raised a \[Rock Wall\] to block the fireballs.

The vain blond noble, Tristan Humphrey, sent fireballs flying with a
kick infused with wind mana and surveyed the battlefield.

One person, unable to dodge a fireball, was hit and thrown back. Tristan
saw him, widened his eyes, and made faces.

"That fool!!"

"Ian!!"

Ian Fairytale, a student with the light element and unparalleled
destructive force laid unconscious, steam rising from his body.

Meanwhile, in Bartos Hall.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac **Lv:** (159)

Currently, \[vs. Human Combat Power\] was at 76. For every 10 stat
points invested, my level temporarily increased by 5. This meant my
level would increase by 35 whenever I fought against a human.

My view constantly flickered from the disunfunctioning chandelier.

*Whoosh!*

A tachi infused with cold mana tore through the air in a moment of
darkness.

Isaac, while casting a spell, twisted his body and narrowly dodged the
sword strike aimed at his chest.

Frost encroached on his body as he urgently kicked off the ground to put
distance between himself and Zenon.

"...This is crazy."

A piercing chill that exceeded Isaac’s ice resistance enveloped his
chest. He narrowly avoided freezing.

He shouldn’t have relied solely on instinct to evade the blade. He
needed to deliberately widen the gap.

He absolutely could not let it graze him. The chill was at a level where
even a close pass could freeze parts of his body.

Moreover, because it was a tachi, its blade was long, making it much
more difficult than anything Isaac had experienced in the game.

"Weren't you the Nameless Hero?"

Zenon sheathed his tachi.

If Isaac had been the Nameless Hero, Zenon was determined to risk his
life just to inflict even a minor wound on him.

Perhaps even that was a pipe dream, for the Nameless Hero was a champion
among champions, beyond any norm.

But now, there was no need to even consider that assumption.

Though Isaac's mana density had increased sharply, it was merely the
effect of his magic staff.

"The Queen has harbored vain suspicions all along."

Zenon grabbed the brim of the military cap, pulled it over his eyes, and
murmured a monologue.

*This concludes it. Alice had suspected that Isaac was the Nameless
Hero, but unfortunately, that suspicion turned out to be false.*

The silver-blue-haired boy was simply the result of great talent and
rigorous training.

*Shhhck!*

Brandishing his blade, Zenon lunged at Isaac once more. The tachi struck
like a bolt of cold lightning.

*Clash!*

*Boom!!*

Isaac scrambled backward as he casted an ice spell, Zenon clashed with
the same kind of magic. Ice collided with ice, and cold grappled with
cold, neutralizing each other.

As cold wind whirled about, two men exchanged blows in the flickering
scenery.

The power of elemental magic, mana mastery, and combat experience—all
favored Zenon. However, precisely for that reason, the longer the fight
continued, the more Zenon couldn’t help but admire Isaac's talent.

As if reading his attack, Isaac consistently made rational decisions,
effectively evading and retaliating whenever the opportunity presented
itself.

Moreover, his magic casting speed was extremely fast. His brain must be
working at a terrifying speed.

This wasn’t the level of a mere student.

Even if this silver-haired man wasn’t the Nameless Hero, it was clear he
was a genius born with extraordinary talent.

*But... I'm sorry.*

*Surely, you would have blossomed into a great wizard in the future.*

*But I must kill you.*

*I must snuff your future.*

*For Queen Alice, for the kingdom I must protect,*

Zenon thought this as he unleashed a fierce onslaught on Isaac.

Isaac's movements slowed. The frost of Zenon’s blade was overwhelming
Isaac's body.

*Crackle!*

Zenon dodged Isaac's elemental magic attack, infiltrated his defense,
and swung his tachi.

Isaac, in an effort to avoid the first sword strike, forcibly widened
the distance by jerking himself backward, inevitably making his
movements larger.

The second sword strike sharply cut through the air.

Isaac’s eyes widened; he desperately drew a dagger from his robes.

Immediately, he braced the hand holding the hilt of the dagger with
Zhonya's Staff and guarded against Zenon’s blade.

*Clang!*

Sparks flew from the friction of metal but were quickly swallowed by the
surging cold.

Neither yielded. Both men continued their struggle, putting their weight
into their blades.

Simultaneously, the cold unleashed by them kept each other at bay. Their
mana intertwined, each trying to freeze the other.

"Ugh!"

Isaac groaned.

Isaac realized that his dagger was gradually freezing.

As a result, the struggle increasingly turned against Isaac as his body
gradually faltered.

Isaac gritted his teeth and strained his body as he tried to withstand
being pushed back.

Zenon, without even breathing heavily, calmly narrowed his eyes and
watched.

"...Impressive."

"What?"

Isaac furrowed his brow.

"You have remarkable qualities. It would be a pity for you to die here.
But... it's unfortunate."

"..."

"Curse me, Isaac."

Then, the Sheath of Disaster slid down the leg of his trousers and fell
at Isaac's feet.

Immediately, he kicked it with the tip of his shoe, activating the
stored ice spell.

"...!"

Taken aback by the unexpected turn of events, Zenon kicked the ground
and fled backward.

However, the Sheath of Disaster had already detonated a blast of ice at
him.

*Kwaaaaa!!*

A five-star ice spell, \[Frost Explosion\].

Ice boulders erupted with the explosion. Zenon wailed in pain from his
severely frozen leg. Although he had avoided a direct blow, he couldn’t
completely evade the icy explosion.

*Whoosh!*

In an instant, Isaac dashed through the dense cold. Zenon's eyes widened
at the tremendous speed.

Zenon's judgment was delayed.

Despite his unstable posture, Zenon hastily tried to swing his tachi.

*Thump!!*

However, Isaac's fist was faster.

"Oof!!"

The fierce punch slugged Zenon squarely in the face with the force of a
cannonball.

*Whoom!*

With that, Isaac's punch sent Zenon flying.

Zenon's body sliced through the air and bounced twice off the ground. He
conjured a block of ice, stepped on it, and halted his momentum.

Zenon gasped for air. Blood streamed from his mouth and nose. He was
constantly surrounded by a solid \[Basic Protection Magic\], but even
that was negligible against the formidable and fierce punch from Isaac.

Zenon lifted his head with a shocked expression.

Blood dripped from Isaac's fist.

"For a student, how could...?"

His voice fell silent and heavy.

In the swirling cold, Isaac's chilling red eyes glinted ominously.

Contained within those eyes was a suppressed rage.

<span id="0206_208_Alice_Subjugation_4.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 208: Alice Subjugation (4)
==================================

“Distinguishing by student or adult in the middle of a fight…?”

Isaac’s voice was as cold and composed as frost.

“I don’t need you to patronize me.”

Zenon spat out blood, straightening up to glare at the
sliver-blue-haired boy.

Though part of his leg was frozen, impairing his movement, he still
believed himself to be superior to Isaac.

However…

“Or, did you want to show some sympathy before killing me because I’m a
student?”

Whether it was the exceptionally talented boy, Isaac.

Or Zenon, whose years of training far exceeded Isaac’s.

“Here, it’s all about who wins and who loses. Nothing else matters.”

In the end, this fight would destroy one of their futures.

“Does the process matter?”

*…That’s right.*

Zenon’s expression softened. Those few words from Isaac had cleared the
turmoil in Zenon’s mind.

Did he pity the boy before him until just now?

Yet, he couldn’t shake off this guilt.

“...You’re right, Isaac.”

Zenon removed his military cap and dropped it to the floor, along with
his ludicrous hypocrisy.

*That’s right… I shouldn’t feel any guilt about trampling on this boy’s
future.*

Neither needed to speak until this fight ended.

Zenon gripped the hilt of his Tachi in both hands, readying himself for
battle again.

“...”

Isaac closely observed Zenon and adjusted his grip on Zhonya’s Staff.

His body felt heavy. It was slowly freezing under the amplified coldness
from Zenon’s Tachi.

Dragging out the fight against Zenon would only put him at a
disadvantage, especially when time was not on his side.

He decided to end the battle swiftly.

Isaac resolved himself and dashed towards Zenon with a kick off the
ground.

*Kkaang!*

*Boooom!*

The two men clashed elemental magic and swung their weapons at each
other. The flurry of cold strikes drew countless lines in the air.

Then, Zenon retreated, thrusting his Tachi upward.

Heavy ice and lightning cloaked his blade. Having already foreseen
Zenon’s next move through \[Psychological Insight\], Isaac immediately
conjured a wall of ice infused with rock, \[Fossilized Ice\].

Soon, Zenon swung his Tachi downwards.

*Kwagagagang!!*

A cold slash wrapped in lightning tore through the ground.

Countless bolts of lightning whipped like chains and mercilessly struck
the ground.

“…!”

\[Fossilized Ice\] shielded Isaac’s body and shattered into fragments as
the cracked ground crumbled away.

With nowhere to stand, Isaac’s body hovered in mid-air.

As he fell with the rubble into the vast first-floor hall, Isaac
examined Zenon coldly.

*Boom!*

Zenon launched himself off the rubble and leaped towards Isaac.

This was the decisive moment.

Isaac shouted.

“Eden!!”

**\[Kyuuu!\]**

*Koooooo!*

As Zenon was about to draw a trail with his long blade, charged with
frost and lightning.

From the first floor, a pillar of rock shot towards Zenon with fierce
momentum. It was the 4-star spell, \[Rock Avalanche\].

In a flash, Zenon spotted a small golem casting magic towards him from
the first floor. It was Eden, a rock golem familiar that Isaac had
summoned and kept on standby.

“Tsk!”

Zenon skillfully altered the trajectory of his sword.

A cold slash charged with lightning struck the \[Rock Avalanche\].

*Boooooom!!*

The magic-dense pillar of rock extending towards Zenon exploded,
scattering debris in all directions.

However, Isaac’s strategy wasn’t to counterattack with \[Rock
Avalanche\], but rather to divert Zenon’s attention elsewhere for a
moment.

“…!”

Zenon’s eyes flashed wide open.

He could counter magic. His mind was always processing magic formulas,
ready to use them at a moment's notice.

Therefore, if Isaac launched a spell, Zenon could reflexively unleash
his own magic to neutralize it.

But what Isaac intended to use wasn’t magic.

Zhonya’s Staff slipped from Isaac’s grasp and plummeted to the hall on
the first floor.

From the moment Eden activated \[Rock Avalanche\], Isaac had been
gripping something with both hands, ready to swing.

Topaz mana coalesced sharply.

Relying on instinct, Zenon swung his sword, twisting his head towards
Isaac.

*Kwaaak!!*

*“Kugh!!”*

Before he could react, a rock greatsword lodged itself into Zenon’s
abdomen.

The chilling sound of innards bursting and bones shattering echoed as
the recoil of the sword strike caused the topaz rock mana to burst out
spectacularly.

A direct hit. It was a critical strike, fully utilizing Isaac’s superior
physical abilities.

*Boom!*

Zenon’s body flew at tremendous speed and slammed into the wall.

The wall didn’t collapse due to the strong protective barrier.

Isaac slid down an ice slide he created, landing gracefully on the
ground, and slung the Obsidian Blade over his shoulder.

Under normal circumstances, swinging the Obsidian Blade wrapped in rock
mana would have turned his hand to stone.

Thanks to the boost in stats from \[vs. Human Combat Power\], only the
tips of his fingers were petrified, leaving the rest unharmed.

“*Uhugh…!”*

Zenon spat out blood from his mouth.

He had been careless.

Zenon had expected Isaac to have a hidden weapon and even accounted for
a longsword’s range, but he never imagined it to be a rock greatsword.

Or perhaps… was it really carelessness?

In truth, he felt it. Isaac’s ability to make split-second decisions had
already surpassed Zenon’s own combat experience.

Specifically, \[Psychological Insight\] played a significant role.

Unaware of this, Zenon slumped against the wall and could only marvel
silently at Isaac’s talent.

He tried to stand, but couldn’t. His body felt very heavy. Looking down,
he could see the petrified remains of his abdomen.

A sudden wave of fatigue hit him. It felt like his consciousness would
fade away at any moment.

Isaac’s eyes, glowing yellow, turned towards Zenon. Behind him, a
mysterious ring of rocks floated in the air. In his right hand was the
rock greatsword, the defensive ability of the Obsidian Blade,
\[Eclipse\].

Isaac approached Zenon.

Zenon did not give up and unleashed a barrage of ice and lightning
magic. However, Isaac easily dodged or countered these attacks with his
own magic or deflected them with his greatsword.

Because Zenon had allowed himself to be critically wounded, defending
against his attacks was incredibly simple for Isaac.

*“Uck…!”*

Zenon vomited blood onto the floor. The sudden onset of drowsiness made
his vision blur.

Isaac stood in front of him and stared him down, without any expression.

Clearly, Zenon had the upper hand in terms of power.

Yet now, it was Zenon who lay bleeding and incapacitated.

*Remarkable…*

Somehow, Zenon felt not inferiority or anger towards Isaac, but
admiration.

He saw the younger version of himself, who used to wield a sword and
train. But this boy… he was going to be far stronger than him.

Suddenly, he wanted to see this boy’s future.

But Zenon thought that was a wish that would never come true.

“...It’s my loss.”

A mix of guilt for not completing his mission, regret for not being able
to see this man’s future, and an odd sense of relief came together.

The bitter taste of metal lingered in his mouth, and a bittersweet
emotion burst out as a hollow laugh.

Lastly, with a voice choked with emotion, Zenon spoke.

“I’m glad you were my last opponent… Not a bad feeling at all…”

*Puuhk!*

*“Puhuk!”*

Out of nowhere, Isaac delivered a spinning kick to Zenon’s head.

Zenon collapsed to the side, losing consciousness.

“Shut up.”

Isaac didn’t want to hear anything from the loser.

He seemed to be lost in sentiment, but all Isaac could think was “So
what?”

The rock-powered form of the Obsidian Blade returned to Isaac’s body.
His eyes reverted to a dull red, and the ring of rock behind him
vanished.

\[Level Up!! Your level has increased to 125!\] \[You have gained 4 stat
points!\]

“Good.”

Isaac breathed a sigh of relief.

“Good job, Eden.”

\[**Kyuuu!\]**

Isaac gave a thumbs up to Eden. The little golem, Eden, responded by
raising his right arm.

Then, Isaac reverse-summoned Eden.

“...Ah, right.”

Before moving on, Isaac remembered.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, there was an item drop after defeating
Zenon.

Isaac quickly stripped the uniform off the unconscious Zenon and
rummaged through the pockets.

“Oh.”

As seen in the game, he found ten small vials of healing potion. These
potions, sourced from the Heart Kingdom, were quite effective.

Though not as effective as healing magic, they were good recovery items
for emergencies.

He drank one. It was almost sweet but bland, with a strong bitterness
rising before it went down his throat.

Isaac grimaced.

“I’ll take the loot.”

He kept the remaining potions as extras and retrieved Zhonya’s Staff and
the Sheath of Disaster.

His petrified fingertips were slowly healing. The pain, as well as the
parts of his body that had frozen due to Zenon’s chill, slowly improved.
The recovery speed was faster than he expected.

Isaac ran up the stairs. He needed to meet Alice as soon as possible.

“…”

The first floor of Bartos Hall was left with piles of debris, and Zenon,
who had his uniform stripped off, was left unconscious in a pitiful
state.

<span id="0207_209_Alice_Subjugation_5.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 209: Alice Subjugation (5)
==================================

I defeated the Spade Paladin Zenon and gained 1 level.

The newly acquired 4 stats were all invested in \[Vs Human Combat
Power\].

Therefore, the total stat points currently allocated to \[Vs Human
Combat Power\] were now 80. It remained Grade A, but now, whenever I
recognized a human as an enemy and engaged them in combat, my level
would temporarily increase by 40.

Now, it was truly beyond the point where I could make excuses using
something like the buff I got from Zhonya's Staff.

While ascending the stairs, I glanced outside the building using
\[Clairvoyance\]. It was truly a scene of chaos.

Fortunately, the academy's combat forces and the Imperial Knights had a
well-established battle system prioritizing survival. That was why they
were able to respond to the Paladins and Trump soldiers without any
casualties.

Moreover, since Trump soldiers were reverse-summoned upon receiving
fatal wounds, it seemed relatively easier to win than in the game. It
was essentially a numerical advantage.

In front of Bartos Hall. It seemed to take more time for Kaya to defeat
the Tiger Dragon, Bandersnatch. The Trump soldiers and Jubjub Bird had
disappeared, indicating that she had likely finished them all off.

Dorothy was still continuing her battle against Nightmare Dragon
Jabberwock and Phantom Cat Cheshire.

As expected, Luce also intervened, fighting against Shera Hectorica,
Heart Jack, and Trump soldiers, wearing the Ring of the Abyssal Queen.
Shera’s forces could not win.

Before I knew it, I had reached the entrance to the rooftop of Bartos
Hall. It was an arched doorway.

The surroundings were dark and eerily quiet.

A barrier that stopped the time of everything that made contact with it
was deployed on the rooftop. This was likely why even sounds were
blocked.

I felt the sensation of an immense amount of mana pressing down on my
skin as if I were under a hydraulic press.

A forbidden spell that defied truth was about to be cast before my very
eyes.

As I touched the door, Alice's voice resonated in my head.

*─ Isaac, would it be okay if you stayed the night with me?*

As mentioned before, in ❰Magic Knights of Märchen❱, Alice was a
character shrouded in mystery.

The only question about Priestess Mei in「Act 8, Priestess of the Red
Lotus」 was why she suddenly acted out, but when one thought about it,
she was clearly portrayed as a sociopath. Therefore, there was already a
unanimous opinion on the answer to that sole question.

That wasn’t the case for Alice.

How she knew the times of the demons' appearances, why she helped revive
the Evil God, why she had to commit suicide in the end... none of it was
known precisely. It was all a mystery.

The Forum often speculated that Alice might be a Regressor, a common
trope where characters go insane after repeatedly facing despair through
many returns. This even provided a plausible reason for how she knew
when the demons would appear.

However, now there was no point in worrying about that...

Since the answer laid beyond this door.

I opened the door.

*Creak.*

A radiance engulfed my vision, making me squint from the brightness.

Soon, the scene of the rooftop, painted with golden mana, came into
view. A uniquely shaped golden magic circle filled the rooftop,
emanating an eerie mana.

Numerous clock shapes floated around in a powerful barrier deployed in
the vicinity.

In the middle of the rooftop, a mysterious monolith that I had never
wanted to see again was about two-thirds of the way complete.

In front of it floated an alien pocket watch, hovering in the air.

An astronomical amount of mana seemed to tear through space, flowing
from the pocket watch and stitching up the monolith.

The mana, even possessing physical force, flowed like a gentle wind,
softly fluttering my hair.

"...Alice."

The female student with light gold hair who was staring at the \[Obelisk
of Eternity\] turned her head toward me.

Her expression was cold, her eyes hollow as if she hadn't slept at all.

"Hello, Baby."

She greeted me calmly.

Despite her shadowed and tired face, her voice was the same as usual,
the same voice I got to know as the one of Alice Carroll's.

"Did you come because you missed me?"

"I came to stop you."

"Heh, I see you're not planning to use honorifics anymore?"

"You're not my senior anymore."

Now, Alice was not only facing expulsion but even the possibility of
execution.

*Why would I use honorifics with someone I'm in conflict with?*

"That's right. Indeed..."

Alice looked down with a regretful expression, then looked up at me
again.

"So... are you the Black Monster, Baby?"

After pulling out a magic cloak of disguise from her magic pouch, she
briefly wore a mask and then removed it.

For a moment, I must have appeared to Alice as the Black Monster, The
Nameless Hero.

Alice blinked heavily, perhaps lost in thought.

"So it was true... You won't ask why I did all this?"

"More importantly, I have something to ask. Did you manipulate the
priestess?"

Alice nodded.

"Do you hate me?"

"...Alice."

Whether or not I should resent Alice would depend on how she answered.

I pointed to my neck.

"Take off the choker."

Alice showed no change in expression, nor did she question the intent
behind my words.

If my thoughts from last night were correct, that choker wasn't worn
just for style.

It must have been worn “to hide something”.

Just like the mother of Snow White, who always wore dresses that covered
her neck whenever she tried to assassinate her.

How could White's mother have passed on a pocket watch containing the
worst kind of demon, The Abyss?

And who was the one unleashing The Abyss?

*Click.*

Alice swept up her hair and unfastened the choker.

"...You knew."

A strange mark, glowing with dark red mana, was wrapped around her neck
like a wave.

\* \* \*

There existed a demon that embedded fragments of its power and
personality into others through contracts.

This demon marked the neck of the contractee as a token of the
agreement, embedding fragments of its power and personality within, as
it did with the mother of Princess Snow White.

The demon exploited the weaknesses in the mind and drew out the evil
nature hidden within. Alice used the power implanted by the demon to
amplify the malevolence of Priestess Mei.

How about the contradiction of Alice reverse-summoning her own minions
to prevent their deaths, unlike what Isaac had seen in the Trials of
Frost or the game?

The sole difference was that “Alice hadn’t committed murder after coming
to the academy”.

If Alice killed innocent people and felt extreme guilt over it, the
demon would exploit the vulnerabilities created by this guilt to
heighten Alice's evil.

However, Alice had not killed anyone at the academy yet. Therefore, she
was able to maintain her sanity without being consumed by malice.

The correct answer was often the simplest. The timing of the demon's
appearance, and involvement with Leafa the Illusive, it was all possible
simply because “that demon” who could communicate with the Evil God told
them.

Phantom Cat Cheshire's perception of Alice's heart, too, was shrouded by
the fragments of that demon's power and personality, like the moon
obscured by dark clouds.

The source of mana within a human body was structured in such a way that
it couldn’t become the subject of a familiar or minion contract, as if
it were a contract made by a god.

Therefore, human familiars or minions could not exist.

However, there were demons in this world who were born with the power to
manipulate even the laws governed by contracts and were capable of
making absolute agreements.

The final boss of the Semester 1 Year 3 of ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱,
and an agent of the Evil God.

Mephisto the Contractor.

In addition to being cautious in order to eliminate the nuisance named
Ian Fairytale, the demon also searched for ways to summon his master,
the Evil God Nephid, a bit more quickly.

Eventually, he discovered an item called the Phantasmal Clock, which was
located in Wonderland.

Therefore, he took the citizens of the Heart Kingdom hostage and made a
contract with Alice.

Alice just had to complete one of two tasks.

Either help the demon handle Ian Fairytale or if she failed, the
citizens of the Heart Kingdom and Alice's dear friends would all be
annihilated, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Heart Kingdom.
It was an unfair contract, equivalent to a threat.

Alice was the hero of Wonderland and a human. To Mephisto, there was no
other candidate as suitable as her.

However, Mephisto could not control Alice's will as he wished. This was
generally why he tried to delve into the minds of beings to draw out
their malice.

Therefore, to ensure Alice faithfully fulfilled the contract, Mephisto
whispered in a sweet voice.

"After all, the world where the Evil God will be resurrected is a
completely different world from Wonderland. Only that world will be
destroyed. If you just faithfully fulfill the contract, you can return
to your ordinary lives."

That day, Alice became Mephisto’s henchman.

*─ On the contrary, I want to return home.*

Isaac recalled what Alice had said.

Alice attempting to resurrect the Evil God to protect something dear to
her was no different than killing all the innocent people in this world
in order for her to ensure the survival of her own people.

No matter how much Alice and her subordinates were forced to do such
heinous acts, the facts didn’t change.

“You’ve taken on a lot, haven’t you?”

“I can’t tell you the details. It would be a big problem if I did.”

If the contents of the contract with Mephisto were disclosed, there
would be a terrible penalty. Knowing this, Isaac did not probe any
further.

Soon, Isaac swallowed his saliva.

If the Evil God was resurrected, it wouldn’t just be this world that was
destroyed. Alice was unaware of this fact.

*Could Wonderland be an exception?*

Calming his emotions, Isaac asked in a calm voice.

“What will you do if, even if you succeed this time, the result is the
same as if you had failed?”

He couldn’t be sure. Wonderland might be a blind spot that could escape
destruction.

But Isaac couldn’t shake the thought that Wonderland too would be
destroyed.

“Baby.”

Alice looked down.

“If you really are the greatest Archwizard of this era, can you break
this cursed contract and help me?”

“…”

It was already the exerted power of the demon. If the contract with
Mephisto had already been made, Isaac could not break its bond.

The only way to forcibly terminate the contract was through death.

Thus, he remained silent.

Alice looked back at Isaac as if she had expected this.

"If that's difficult, then don't say such things."

Alice had no intention of losing her motivation over a few words from
Isaac.

She was well aware that she and Isaac stood on opposite sides.

The only thing she could trust was the contract with absolute binding
power.

Even if she ended up looking foolish and guilty as a result.

Alice intended to resurrect the Evil God in order to protect what she
wanted to preserve.

"...Yes."

*Boom.*

Isaac grasped a dagger in one hand and slammed Zhonya's Staff onto the
ground. From the tip of the staff, ice spread forth.

*Whoosh!*

He emitted coldness from his whole body and unfolded five magic circles.

The mixed emotions inside him began to regain order.

"I have no choice but to stop you first."

Ultimately, Isaac's emotions reached a point of determination.

He resolved to stop Alice with his own hands.

Because that was what he could, no, must do now.

There was a practical consideration as well. No matter how strong Alice
was compared to him, she was extremely exhausted from constructing
\[Obelisk of Eternity\] and summoning her minions and familiars.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, the Nightmare Dragon had helped Alice,
making the difficulty higher. But now, since Dorothy was dealing with
the Nightmare Dragon, he wasn’t an issue.

Furthermore, since Alice had to fight while protecting the Phantasmal
Clock, Isaac thought it was a battle worth trying.

"Thank you for understanding."

Alice smiled very kindly, as if it were her last, and soon lowered the
corners of her mouth.

In the air, faint red mana blossomed, forming the shape of a divine
sword.

When Alice grabbed the handle of the sword, mana flowed from the blade,
enveloping her body and forming armor.

The hero's sword, the Vorpal Sword, which had subdued the Nightmare
Dragon - Jabberwock.

Alice swung the sword, scattering beautiful faint red mana.

"It's been fun."

"Likewise."

No matter how hard one tried, there was no guarantee that life would
bloom beautifully.

However, that was not a reason for Alice to resurrect the Evil God and
become a mass murderer of humanity.

Suddenly, a memory surfaced in Isaac's mind. It was the scene of Alice
committing suicide.

After being defeated by Ian Fairytale and his companions, she, with a
hollow smile, slit her own throat.

*Why did Alice choose to commit suicide after losing the battle?*

*Is it to atone for the innocent people who died?*

*Or did she make that choice out of a sense of despair?*

*Or is there a reason she felt she had no choice but to commit suicide?*

Isaac intended to win the duel with Alice and learn the whole truth.

No one yet knew what end it would bring.

*Boom!*

Isaac leapt towards Alice.

\[Status\] **Name:** Isaac **Lv:** (165)

<span id="0208_210_Alice_Subjugation_6.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 210: Alice Subjugation (6)
==================================

Wonderland. The other dimension Alice fell into.

This bizarre world, which she had only seen in her dreams, had one day
become her reality.

In a place where people and animals had lost their minds, Alice managed
to keep her sanity and survive.

She beheaded the Queen of Hearts, who killed anyone who crossed her and
seized her power.

She acquired the legendary sword, the Vorpal Sword, and defeated the
Nightmare Dragon - Jabberwock.

Thus, Alice became the new Queen of Hearts and the hero of Wonderland.

Her adventure didn’t always sail smoothly. If someone were to write
about her journey, many pages would be devoted to her longing to see her
parents and her frustration at having to endure so many frightening and
terrifying events.

But looking back, her journey had brought about many connections.

All of which had become exceedingly precious to Alice.

Then, one day.

A demon, holding the lives of the foot soldiers, came to her. This demon
commanded a formidable army as his minions.

He approached Alice and whispered.

*Let’s make a deal.*

*Boooooom!!*

The explosion pulled Alice out of her painful memories.

Isaac, the silver-blue-haired man, came into her view. He was running
towards her.

She unleashed the spell of death in the shape of a rabbit and her
all-consuming \[Voracious Deity\] and aimed it all at him.

He quickly dodged or skillfully countered with his ice magic.

But his attacks were inevitably delayed because of Alice’s fierce
onslaught, preventing him from approaching rashly.

“It seems you’re not planning to use your real power.”

The slightly desperate Alice could not guess Isaac’s true intentions.
Why wasn’t he using his true power when he could easily defeat someone
like her?

Was he determined to defeat her as Isaac, the one she had spent time
with, and not as the Nameless Hero?

Or did he think that his current level of power was enough to defeat
her?

Either way, it was such a ridiculous thought, that Alice couldn’t help
but smirk at it.

*Hwaaaak!*

Alice wrapped her sword with mana and swung. A fierce, yet noble,
crimson sword energy quickly sliced through the air.

Isaac frowned. He felt an enormous amount of mana pressing down on him.

The power of the Vorpal Sword was to banish nightmares. However, if the
sword’s bearer harbored murderous intent, it could slice through an
enemy’s body, trapping them in an eternal dream and blurring the lines
between dreams and reality. The end for anyone struck by it was certain
death.

Knowing that even a touch of the sword’s energy meant death, Isaac
explosively launched \[Frostfire\], using the recoil to push himself
away from the blade.

Then, Isaac immediately cast the 6-star ice spell, \[Frost Glitter\].

A pale blue magic circle unfolded in the air and a heavy mass of cold
air shot out. However, The Vorpal Sword’s energy split the \[Frost
Glitter\] in half, neutralizing it.

*Poooong!!*

\[Frost Glitter\] exploded. The countless icicles aimed at Alice
scattered with fierce force. Alice deployed a telekinetic shield to
deflect the icicles.

After using body buffing magic to increase her agility, Alice used
telekinesis to create an invisible object in the air and launched
herself off it. The spot she stepped on rippled and emitted a beautiful
light.

*Boooong!*

Something intangible catapulted Alice forward, and she flew toward Isaac
with terrifying momentum.

Landing on the rooftop, Alice elegantly swung her sword at Isaac, the
blade adorned with a crimson aura.

Suddenly, Isaac clutched at the air. His hand pulsed with rock mana,
forming a greatsword.

The rock greatsword, once wielded by the primordial rock sovereign, the
Obsidian Blade.

Alice narrowed her eyes. It was clear the greatsword was no ordinary
magic weapon, imbued with immense rock mana.

Handling such a weapon proved that Isaac was indeed the Nameless Hero.

But Alice had no thoughts of retreating.

*Pooooong!!*

The Vorpal Sword clashed with the Obsidian Blade. Although Alice was
physically weaker than Isaac, the enormous amount of mana she possessed
made up for it and then some.

The sword energy exploded up close, hurling Isaac’s body like a ball.

*Kuung!*

Isaac crashed through the entrance and into the wall.

*Kugh.*

Isaac got up and shook off the debris from his body without a moment to
spare. Thanks to the defensive skill of the Obsidian Blade, \[Eclipse\],
he wasn’t seriously injured.

Again, Alice slammed something intangible mid-air made from telekinesis.
It flew like a rocket, scattering crimson mana.

A moment ago, during their clash, Isaac had realized that the power of
the Vorpal Sword could be countered by the unique skill of the Obsidian
Blade.

Recalling the basic swordsmanship techniques he had learned from Merlin
Astrea, Isaac kicked off the ground and put his entire weight into a
diagonal slash.

The dense rock mana-infused blade collided with Alice’s blade.

*Kuuuung!!*

*Kagagak!!*

A torrent of rock mana erupted. Broad waves of stone surged in all
directions.

The heavy strike of the greatsword sliced through Alice’s sword energy,
cutting down towards her. Alice hadn’t been able to summon enough mana
in time to block the blow. She was exhausted.

A sharp yellow sword energy surged along the sword’s path. Sensing the
danger beforehand, Alice used telekinesis to push her body away to dodge
the sword strike.

However, rock fragments exploded and dug deep into Alice’s body, and the
powerful shockwave generated by the greatsword engulfed her.

\[Stone Breathing - First Form\]. Golden Wave Slash.

Alice was thrown back, spitting blood, but she was able to land safely
thanks to her telekinesis.

Isaac exhaled deeply and glared at Alice, following the sword energy
beyond the sharp rock formations.

Part of his fingers had turned to stone, losing all sensation. He was
now unable to use the Obsidian Blade with the same finesse as before and
even performing Stone Breathing would be difficult.

Isaac clicked his tongue and leaped towards Alice again.

Alice launched dozens of crimson sword energies at the approaching
figure. Isaac cut through or deflected them with the Obsidian Blade, not
stopping his charge.

Alice was impressed. He was now starting to grasp how to handle the
power of the Vorpal Sword.

Higher-tier neutral magic was also linked, but Isaac skillfully dodged
or blocked it.

Momentum was building.

He adapted frighteningly as if he had fought Alice several times before.

Isaac’s mind furiously processed the calculations for elemental magic.
Behind him, several magic circles built and dissolved at a terrifying
pace.

Ice and rock magic incessantly rained down on Alice and the Phantasmal
Clock.

Isaac targeted the corners. His ultimate goal had always been the
Phantasmal Clock. Since the clock was actively building the \[Obelisk of
Eternity\], Alice couldn’t shield it without interrupting the magical
flow.

Instead, she focused on defending against Isaac’s diverse strategies.

Gradually, Isaac was losing sensation in his hands due to petrification.
It was a side effect of wielding the Obsidian Blade.

He partially summoned the rock golem familiar, Eden, whose power merged
with Isaac.

A rock armor encased Isaac’s arms, and the topaz ring of the Obsidian
Blade on his back was coated with the same bronze armor. While this
didn’t alleviate the numbness in his hands, it did allow him to
forcefully grip the Obsidian Blade.

Isaac moved even more swiftly.

The tide of the battle was rapidly turning.

If Alice could summon even one of her familiars, her victory would be
nearly certain.

However, all her familiars were already engaged in a battle elsewhere,
unable to join her.

Should she call up more of her foot soldiers? No. If Isaac unleashed a
rock-infused sword energy even once, they would be obliterated in an
instant. Besides, in the confined space of the rooftop, they would
likely be in the way of her Vorpal Sword’s energy.

Isaac gripped the Obsidian Blade and charged in. Alice gave up on
evasion and pooled every ounce of her strength to draw out the power of
the Vorpal Sword. Mana infused the blade, igniting it like flames.

She swung.

*Hwaaaaak!!*

A scorching sword energy was unleashed with nowhere to dodge.

Isaac swung his rock mana-infused Obsidian Blade in response, but it was
insufficient to cut through Alice’s attack.

*Kwaaaang!!*

A beautiful explosion of crimson mana and yellow rock mana erupted.

The aftermath caused Alice’s hair and clothes to flutter rapidly.

*Whiiiing.*

Isaac’s silhouette, still wielding the greatsword, could be seen through
the swirling dust. He drew rock mana, forming magic circles behind him.

Alice swung the Vorpal Sword once more, unleashing sword energy towards
him.

Suddenly, someone rose through the cloud of dust.

It was Isaac.

Within the dust, there was another figure resembling him.

It was the rock golem familiar, Eden, who had grown into a form that
resembled Isaac, holding the Obsidian Blade.

Floating mid-air, Isaac pointed his numb right index finger at the
Phantasmal Clock. He gripped it with his other hand, ready to act.

Pointing with his index finger was meant to improve his accuracy.

Behind him, seven pale blue magic circles unfolded. He had been
calculating this magic while climbing the stairs, and now it was ready
to use.

A sharp chill swept through.

Alice hastily slashed at Isaac with her sword, but he dodged by twisting
his body.

As she fired off a series of blows, Eden, cloaked in rock skin, lunged
at her, swinging the Obsidian Blade.

Unable to wield it properly, Eden was helplessly repelled by Alice’s
magic.

Alice’s gaze turned back to Isaac.

At that moment, Isaac fired the 7-star ice spell, \[Icebolt\], in the
direction his finger pointed.

*Kwakwagang!!*

*Kwaaaang!!*

Several bolts of cold mana shot out like lightning, piercing through the
Phantasmal Clock.

Golden mana scattered like a shattered hourglass.

A series of pale blue explosions sent Alice’s body flying, shattering
the nearly formed \[Obelisk of Eternity\]. The Phantasmal Clock was
utterly destroyed in an instant.

Isaac collapsed helplessly onto the rooftop. Overuse of the Obsidian
Blade beyond his capacity, along with various injuries sustained from
fighting Alice, made it difficult for him to hold himself up. Gritting
his teeth in pain, he barely managed to stand up.

He immediately took out a potion he had gotten from Zenon.

Unable to move his fingers, he shattered the cap and used \[Rock
Generation\] to secure the vial in his hand, then drank the potion. The
effect was immediate.

Next, he reverse-summoned Eden, who had been slammed into the wall. The
Obsidian Blade, now reduced to rock mana on the ground, flowed back into
Isaac.

Alice struggled to her feet.

A faint gasp escaped her blood-soaked lips. It was the only sound her
ears could discern.

Alice lifted her head.

The barrier that had covered the rooftop crumbled into dust.

The magic circle of the \[Obelisk of Eternity\] slowly faded away.

And so, the golden mana gently caressed Alice’s wounded skin as it
naturally dissipated.

The clouds cleared, revealing a beautiful starry sky.

It was a sight she had seen so often that it no longer moved her, but
tonight, the scene especially pleased Alice.

A terrible feeling of emptiness washed over her.

Isaac exhaled sharply and spoke in a calm voice.

“...It’s over.”

“Yeah, I’ve lost.”

All that remained on the ruined rooftop were two people, each with
something significant to protect.

There was an unbridgeable gap between them.

One had won and successfully protected those he cared about.

The other had lost and had to face losing everything.

“Good boy.”

As if expecting it, she felt a pulsing sensation in her throat. Her
expression hardened.

Alice did not want to pay the price of failure.

Even with the Nameless Hero present, many could die.

She lowered her eyes, releasing the protective magic cloaking her skin.

She raised her hand on her neck, drawing up mana.

*It doesn’t take a lot of mana to sever a human neck.*

How ridiculous, she thought, that she could end a life with just this
much power.

It was time to let everything go.

Her life included.

Just then, Isaac, who had rushed over, caught Alice’s hand as she was
releasing mana.

Thanks to the potion, some sensation and strength had returned to his
hands.

Alice couldn’t comprehend what had just happened, Isaac had moved as if
he had been anticipating this… As if he instinctively sensed her
impending death and intervened.

Without hesitation.

*Why?*

Alice looked at Isaac questioningly as he caught his breath.

“...What are you doing?”

Isaac’s voice was icy.

<span id="0209_211_Alice_Subjugation_7.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 211: Alice Subjugation (7)
==================================

Isaac's grip on her wrist felt very oppressive.

Alice recalled the contract she had made with the demon to protect the
Heart Kingdom and her dear colleagues and friends.

If she failed, she would have to face a price that would result in many
deaths.

Therefore, the only way to prevent this was to break the bonds of the
contract.

The method was simple.

Just die.

To act this way now was merely hypocrisy. After all, hadn't she already
tried to massacre many people?

Yet, if there was no longer a reason to fight.

Alice hoped that no one else would die.

"You see, don't you?"

"Are you giving up on everything?"

"I have no choice."

"Why?"

"If I don't die now, something truly dangerous will come."

Now that there was nothing left to hide, Alice spoke the truth.

*Danger is coming.*

The doubts that had been obscured by a thick fog finally cleared. Only
then could Isaac completely resolve his dilemma about how to deal with
Alice.

"So, there's nothing I can do..."

"But still, don't die."

"What?"

Alice had become a major traitor who would undoubtedly be executed by
the empire. The situation had far exceeded what the academy could
manage.

However, it was a choice forced upon her. Alice was driven by the need
to protect the lives of her loved ones.

Dying so pointlessly just didn't make sense.

"Don't die in vain here."

"What do you know to say something like that—?"

"And!"

*After all, the Evil God will be resurrected soon.*

*Therefore, Alice. If you have failed to destroy this world, you are
inevitably going to pay for your sins.*

"Live beside me and atone. No matter how dangerous it gets, I'll fend it
off."

Join me and fight against the Evil God. Isaac intended to persuade her
that battling the Evil God would be her atonement.

Knowing the full story, Isaac thought that he might be able to enlist
the substantial force of the Heart Kingdom for the future battle against
the Evil God.

He didn't want to miss this perfect opportunity. He was determined to
resolve any issues tied to the empire.

Alice's eyes widened and her expression hardened. After a moment of
speechlessness, she finally spoke.

"Why... do you say that?"

"Can't I say it?"

"..."

Alice intently stared at Isaac's face, heavily covered in both dirt and
dust, riddled with wounds.

Suddenly, she remembered the previous day. It was the memory of playing
with Isaac by the seaside.

It was very enjoyable. The feeling still lingered.

After drinking the last cup of black tea, Alice was able to endure the
profound loneliness with the memory of that time.

It was ironic. The time spent with an enemy had given her the strength
to endure the final night.

*But why?*

Alice couldn't quite discern the reason.

Yet, a self-mocking smile appeared on her lips unwittingly.

Surely because it was an utterly foolish and trivial reason, not even
worth pondering.

"...Baby, this is a shameless request, but."

Alice tried to speak as naturally as possible with a smile, but she
couldn't suppress the emotions welling up inside her.

She knew the ending she was about to face.

Even if the man before her was the greatest wizard of his age, he
couldn't prevent the destined ending for her.

But if he could fulfill just one wish, a wish she could hardly dare to
imagine,

Then Alice thought she could close her eyes in peace.

"Can you really... stop them?"

She barely managed to squeeze out those words. Tears formed and fell
like rain in clouds a forced smile adorned her face, repeatedly
twisting.

Could he defeat the impending dangers, protect the people, and strike
back at the demon she had made a contract with?

Alice's heartfelt plea, laden with anger, despair, agony, pain, sorrow,
injustice, and a desire for revenge, was conveyed to Isaac.

"..."

Isaac was given the power known as the system.

It was a power that could make him stronger than anyone else in the
world.

Yet, he had lost dear ones, was defeated by the Evil God, and had to
endure terrible loss.

But now, given another chance, what should he pursue?

Surely, it should be to achieve the best possible outcome.

Despite the relentless compulsion that pushed Isaac to endure, spilling
sweat and blood daily, vomiting repeatedly, occasionally fainting,
struggling, suffering, and becoming utterly exhausted…

…What started as a struggle for survival had now become a desperate
fight for the best outcome, layered with reasons.

And after struggling desperately, the ultimate outcome he would finally
grasp was clear.

"...I will block everything. So don't you give up either."

Isaac concluded that Alice must be included as well.

It was clear that the impending danger was something the current academy
couldn't handle. It was obvious who had been threatening and using
Alice.

They were enemies that had to be confronted eventually.

*They will all be subdued here.*

Alice smiled brightly as if reassured.

*Crack.*

Suddenly, Alice's face twisted.

Her esophagus twisted and her throat writhed frantically.

She couldn't hold it back anymore. Soon, something terrifying burst
forth from Alice's throat.

*Whoooooosh!!!*

"...!"

Isaac stepped back.

Alice felt excruciating pain as if her neck were twisting, and clutched
at her throat, from which a dark red mana was oozing. She could no
longer control her body.

The mana formed the shape of large wings.

Two black arms burst through Alice's back, stretching out like the arms
of a beast.

A mark engraved on her neck rose up to her face, consuming Alice.

Alice, who could only make a hoarse sound as she tilted her head to the
sky, abruptly stopped moving as if regaining her composure.

Her arms fell limply.

\[A demon has been detected nearby.\]

A system window appeared before Isaac.

A demonic aura emanated from Alice.

At that moment, feeling a chilling sensation, Isaac quickly drew his
dark blue scythe, the Frostscythe.

*Whoooosh!!*

Alice lunged towards Isaac. Her dark red mana spread out like a torrent,
moving at a speed invisible to the eye.

In the blink of an eye, the Vorpal Sword wrapped in dark red energy was
swung fiercely.

Isaac grasped both ends of the Frostscythe, taking a defensive stance.
Alice's mana, mixed with dark mana, was like a flood.

*Clang!!*

The Vorpal Sword clashed with the Frostscythe. Alice forcefully pushed
Isaac back.

Locked in combat, their bodies soared diagonally into the sky. The wings
sprouting from Alice's neck blasted mana-like flames, propelling her
forward.

Their hair and clothes flapped wildly.

As Alice's dark mana relentlessly sought to kill Isaac, he continually
unleashed his chilling mana in resistance. Their mana clashed
tumultuously, maintaining a precarious deadlock.

To the people on the island below, they appeared as a single meteor
shooting backward into the sky, emitting dark red and pale blue lights.

The two quickly moved away from the academy. Isaac could clearly see the
shape of the island, surrounded by the sea.

Alice's face, bearing a mark, was eerily calm. Her eyes, dyed dark
purple, were etched with strange patterns.

\[?\] **Lv:** ?9? **Race:** Dem? **Elements:** ??, ??, ?? **Danger:** ?
High **Psychology:** \[?\]

The status window could not properly read the information. It appeared
that the demon possessing Alice's body had directly inherited the unique
trait \[Red Queen's Paradox\] and made it its own.

As they shot towards the sky, cries from Alice's familiars were heard. A
vicious mana spread across the area.

Dorothy, who had been confronting Nightmare Dragon - Jabberwock and
Phantom Cat Cheshire, widened her eyes as their mana suddenly
intensified.

Kaya, who had defeated the Tiger Dragon - Bandersnatch, and was heading
toward Bartos Hall, was greatly taken aback when the dragon suddenly
grew in size, awakened, and charged at her again.

All of Alice's familiars had lost their minds and were exhibiting
tremendous power.

*Koooooo!*

The sky dyed itself with the blood of the world. Clouds formed and
billowed from the remnants of dark mana.

Consecutively, innumerable magic circles conjured throughout heaven and
earth. As dark mana flickered, demons were summoned en masse.

Shadows fell over the island.

A monstrous creature, large enough to cover the area and more, with
wings shaped like human hands, looked down on the academy from above.
The creature caused massive lightning that split the sky.

Freya the Dark-Winged. Level 184. Dark and lightning elements. Danger
level: Highest.

A pot-bellied black giant with numerous mouths on its belly tilted its
upper body sideways, grinning twistedly at an island it could swallow in
one bite. The many mouths on its belly drooled in anticipation.

Hamon the Gluttonous. Level 185. Dark and water elements. Danger level,
also Highest.

Simultaneously, soldiers with gills and winged knights in black armor
appeared one after another above the sea, each easily exceeding 3 meters
tall.

All of them were a powerful army of demons summoned by the entity that
had possessed Alice's body.

*Guaaaaaa!!*

The demons' shouts and roars resounded like thunder.

People at the academy who witnessed this spectacle felt a deep fear
penetrating their cores.

Even Tristan Humphrey, who always laughed bravely and vowed never to
fear any strong opponent, and Mateo Jordana, who tried to maintain his
firm resolve, could not escape the fear incited by their survival
instincts.

Students gathered in shelters turned pale, and neither the academy’s
faculty nor the Imperial Knights were exceptions.

To them, it looked like a scene from the end of the world.

Meanwhile, Isaac vividly recalled how Alice had committed suicide after
being defeated by Ian's party.

\[Multiple demons have been recognized as enemies.\]

*Is this the scene you feared...?*

*Booooo!*

Their bodies pierced through the dark clouds and soared upward. Isaac,
intensifying the coldness of his aura, pushed back against Alice's mana.

He steadied his fighting spirit.

\[The unique trait \[Hunter\] is activated!\]

Isaac explosively released an extreme cold.

<span id="0210_212_Alice_Subjugation_8.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 212: Alice Subjugation (8)
==================================

The blast of cold air dispersed the clouds of dark mana.

Sensing the impending danger, Alice retreated, and with her newly
emerged crimson wings flapping, she readied herself.

In the sky, a man and a woman faced each other at a distance.

Below them, a massive hole was punched through the clouds.

Six pale blue magic circles formed around Isaac, enveloping him in cold
air. From each of them, a wing imbued with the aura of \[Ice Sovereign\]
stretched out. The cold air gathered into three pairs of wings on the
Ice Sovereign’s back.

A gentle yet profound coldness flowed melodiously. The aura of \[Ice
Sovereign\], the ultimate mastery over the ice element.

*Whoooooo.*

A chilling sensation.

The pale blue mana targeted the demon possessing Alice’s body.

From Alice, a chorus of laughter erupted in multiple voices. Yet, her
face remained expressionless, as if she were a ventriloquist.

From her extended arms, several mouths ripped open and cackling
maniacally. One of them moved its thick lips.

\[**The respectable Nameless Hero.\]**

A woman’s voice resonated hoarsely. Isaac knew well whose voice it was.

Not Alice, but rather…

Mephisto the Contractor spoke through Alice’s body, observing human
formalities.

\[**It is an honor to meet you like this. My name is Mephisto. Pardon my
rudeness for not greeting you in my true form.**

“…”

\[**Oh my, you don’t seem to understand your predicament, do you?\]**

More mouths continued to form on her grotesque arm.

Mephisto’s mouths each uttered a word separately, while other lips
twitched, chuckled, or muttered to themselves.

\[**I made a pact with the Queen of Hearts. She agreed to give up her
body if she failed to fulfill the contract.\]**

“And now that body is?”

\[**It’s completely mine now!\]**

The multitude of lips abruptly stopped laughing.

\[**Surely you don’t feel pity toward the Queen of Hearts, do you? Did
you wish to save her?\]**

Suddenly, more than a dozen lips stretched into a sly grin.

\[**That’s too bad, then…. The Queen of Hearts is no more.\]**

Alice’s body was now overrun with personality fragments and dark mana of
Mephisto the Contractor.

\[**She is as good as dead! The only way to get me out of this body is
to bring it to rest.\]**

That meant death.

Yes, death was the only solution.

If the resurrection of the Evil God failed, nothing else could save
Alice.

She could do nothing but lose all her powers and abilities, merely
fueling the disaster.

Isaac briefly opened his mouth, then closed it. That was his only
reaction.

\[**Oh, Nameless Hero, do not lament! A world burdened by an inferior
race will only be an inferior world. The sacrifice of the Queen of
Hearts will be an excellent fertilizer for the new world Lord Nephid is
creating. How noble is that…!\]**

“There won’t be such a thing.”

There was no need to pay attention to Mephisto’s hoarse, third-rate
conviction.

“Because I will eradicate you.”

*Like squashing cockroaches, that’s all demons are.*

Mephisto raised Alice’s head and scrutinized Isaac.

\[**It’s a shame you don’t understand. But you know…\]**

The silver-blue-haired human was undoubtedly the strongest of mankind.

The thought of being able to eliminate such an opponent excited
Mephisto.

\[**You’re going to die here anyway, aren’t you?\]**

Demons were roaring as they advanced toward the island where Märchen
Academy was located.

Isaac looked down at the island and the sea, blinking quietly.

Mephisto wasn’t just any ol’ demon. He was able to distinguish a
difference in power, meaning…

“...You seem sure of yourself.”

Isaac was confident that his predictions were correct.

The certainty of his predictions, the state of the current situation,
and all the variables he had considered all converged in his mind all at
once.

An outrageous idea flashed through his mind.

He coldly gathered his thoughts.

*Perhaps… there might be a way to save Alice. It’s worth a shot.*

“You…”

Isaac pulled back the hood of his robe and glared at Mephisto with eyes
as bitter as the coldest ice age.

As mentioned before, Alice Carroll and her followers didn’t seek the
world’s destruction out of greed or revenge. They were merely coerced.

In the end, the worst offender was someone else.

It was the demon before him, who had exploited everything about Alice
Carroll and now sought to ravage her death and massacre everyone at
Märchen Academy.

“I will find you and kill you.”

He would find its main body and make it wish for death.

Let it suffer terrible pain, make it scream in agony, and let it die a
death more terrible than what anyone could ever imagine.

*I will make Mephisto pay for playing with people’s lives.*

\[**Go ahead and try.\]**

Mephisto’s numerous lips taunted.

*Gwaaaaah!!*

A black dragon, wreathed in crimson flames, flew in to protect
Mephisto’s back. It roared at Isaac.

It was the Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock, enhanced by Mephisto’s dark
mana.

A suddenly stronger Phantom Cat Cheshire intercepted Dorothy and was
unable to pursue the Nightmare Dragon. It was overtaken by the dark
mana, losing its senses and unleashing a barrage of attacks on Dorothy.

At that moment.

Isaac pulled out a dagger. The white dagger emitted a silver light.

As he drew the blade from its sheath, Mephisto’s eyes caught sight of
the three engraved magic circles.

The Ice Sovereign’s Authority. The Dagger of Oath, and the Dagger of
Pacts. It was the “Blade of Frost Flowers”.

Isaac sliced his hand with the sword, and his crimson blood smoothly
soaked the blade.

*– Hilde, how do I use this?*

*–It’s simple. Just coat the blade with your blood, and say the phrase.
What you say is…*

The Frost Dragon, Hilde, instructed him.

Isaac mouthed the command to activate the “Ritual Circle”, “Summoning
Circle”, and “Contract Circle” engraved on the Blade of Frost Flowers.

***"Serve me, Düpfendorf."***

The three magic circles on the blade resonated with the phrase and the
\[Ice Sovereign\]’s blood, glowing in a pale blue light.

**\[…!\]**

Suddenly, Mephisto frowned in Alice’s body.

After all, this body was stolen from Alice. Even if it died, its main
body would still be unharmed. However, Mephisto felt a deep aversion.
The ritual Isaac was about to perform invoked an overwhelming primal
fear.

Something terrible was about to happen.

*Whoooong.*

An enormous magic circle traced its path beneath Isaac.

An immense amount of mana surged from Isaac, comparable to the vast
ocean. It spread out like a torrent in the sea, stirring up fierce winds
and causing violent waves.

A blizzard raged.

A pure white radiance expelled the crimson mana that colored the sky,
creating a White Night.

The unique skill of the Frostscythe, \[Divine Authority - White Night\].
A sudden chill swept through the sky.

\[**What…?\]**

Feeling the impending crisis, Mephisto immersed itself in the flames of
the Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock to ward off the cold.

It swung the Vorpal Sword at Isaac repeatedly, sending dozens of sword
energy.

The Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock also spewed crimson flames at Isaac.

***"Hilde."***

Along with a fierce \[Frostwind\], the 6-star ice spell \[Frost Wave\]
surged, countering the attacks from Mephisto and the Nightmare Dragon.

Behind Isaac, a pearly white mana rose. The mana began to take the shape
of a huge white dragon.

Isaac poured ice mana into the dragon, enhancing her power. Finally, a
formidable ice familiar filled with a chilling cold that scattered
beautiful pure white mana had appeared.

The mythical magic beast that was said to have been wielded by the first
Ice Sovereign, the Frost Dragon, Hilde.

The white dragon unfurled her majestic wings behind Isaac.

Soon, the bitter sea froze over in an instant.

Some of the demon army, still marching toward the island, were frozen to
death as they were swept away by the rough waves. However, most of them
managed to survive, thanks to their strong mana.

*Hwaaaaa!!*

A large magic circle deployed under Isaac’s feet poured out a brilliant
radiance toward the ground.

Isaac closed his eyes.

\[**Your Majesty.\]**

In the realm of the mind, Isaac stepped into a mystical ice labyrinth.

An ice beast, wrapped in what seemed to be a cloak, bowed deeply to
Isaac in respect.

Frost Spirit, Merphil, the master of this labyrinth and a
nation-destroying ice beast.

\[**Greetings to the new king of Düpfendorf, albeit in an unworthy
body.\]**

The Frost Spirit spoke to Isaac on behalf of Düpfendorf.

\[**Lead us.\]**

*Kuuuuuuu!!*

Isaac opened his eyes again and glared at Mephisto.

Pale blue mana filled the area. This mana took shape in the air and over
the sea of ice. Ice beasts and descendants of the frost tribe were
summoned.

A massive ghost beast with a terrifying aura. The Frost Spirit, Merphil,
revealed its strange body and spread its wings made of ice.

A white bear with a body as big as a mountain range with glacial armor.
The “Glacial Bear Barbatoma” roared at the sky.

A giant dark blue crocodile, “Icebound Crocodile Tugaros”, from the deep
sea, displayed its threatening bulk as it exhaled its fury.

Each of these powerful ice beasts was considered an embodiment of
natural disasters. However, throughout the course of countless
centuries, they had sworn to serve only one being.

Chaos turned to order, and calamity turned into military might.

***"Eden."***

*Kyuuuu!!*

Dense ice and rock mana merged on the sea of ice, and a golem of
terrifying size slowly rose to his feet.

In his hand, it held a giant rock greatsword.

The rock golem familiar “Eden - The Breaker”, infused with ice mana.

He glowed in a pale blue light, along with the nation-destroying ice
beasts.

On the sea of ice, these beings, each a disaster in their own right,
roared in unison, following the majesty of one man.

The newly summoned beings were a knightly order in platinum armor, a
horde of monstrous warriors wrapped in frost, and a legion of frost
mages.

They knelt on one knee and bowed their heads.

They saluted the new Ice Sovereign, who spread three pairs of wings in
the sky, overlooking the land.

The army of the Ice Kingdom, Düpfendorf.

This was the moment they had longed for.

“Is that person… the Nameless Hero…?”

Faculty, students, and the Imperial Knights of Märchen Academy all bore
witness to this scene.

High in the sky, the figure of the Nameless Hero could not be clearly
seen with the naked eye.

Yet, many could guess who it was.

“Senior Isaac…?”

In the shelter, Snow White couldn’t contain her astonishment at the
unbelievable sight.

Dorothy and Kaya glanced sideways at Isaac, who appeared almost divine,
continuing their battle with shocked expressions.

“Isaac…?”

Luce, flying on the Thunderbird, caught a clear view of the Nameless
Hero with her exceptional vision. Her eyes remained wide open, showing
no signs of getting smaller.

***"I command you."***

The Ice Sovereign, Isaac, extended his Frostscythe towards Mephisto.

The power contained in the Blade of Frost Flowers conveyed his will to
the Düpfendorf Army.

***"Eradicate the demons."***

His cynical voice fell.

Above the sea of ice, the Düpfendorf Army roared as they clashed with
Mephisto’s demon army.

Chapter 213: Alice Subjugation (9)
==================================

At the zenith of each element, the four Elemental Kings sensed an
immense ice mana.

In their respective nations, they turned their heads toward the island
where Märchen Academy was located, with surprised faces.

Lightning Nation, “Zabrok”.

In the palace, a man dressed in a black robe. The Lightning Sovereign,
Jaul Dragoniac, closed his eyes and cleared his mind.

*Zzzzt!*

Balkan, a gorilla familiar with lightning mana wrapped around its
shoulders appeared. The beast knelt on one knee and bowed its head to
show respect to its master.

Jaul opened his eyes again and looked at Balkan with violet eyes flowing
with lightning mana.

**\[I, Balkan, have come at the call of the Lightning Sovereign!\]**

"A new Ice Sovereign has been chosen."

Balkan was surprised, but soon composed his expression, having already
heard that a new King would soon emerge from among the students of
Märchen Academy.

"Keep watch over Märchen Academy in the Zelver Empire."

**\[Understood!\]**

Balkan disappeared as lightning mana.

Jaul looked at the brightly lit sky. Now was the time to face Isaac as
King against King.

The northern part of the Empire, Duchy of Whiteclark.

"Lady Aichel?! Please wait!"

Aichel Whiteclark, the next Northern Grand Duchess, ran out in front of
the mansion and looked up at the sky. Her maids hurriedly chased after
her as she acted impulsively.

The Ice Sovereign's brilliant white light was dispelling the darkness of
the night sky. Aichel was certain that Isaac, a student and Archwizard
of Märchen Academy, had revealed his true identity.

Aichel gasped for breath. A smile spread across her lips.

"Come, O King of Ice. I have been waiting for you."

Aichel looked towards the brilliant light, lifting the hem of her dress
and greeting politely. She whispered her greeting softly enough that no
one else could hear.

She was extremely happy because the Ice King she was to serve, the
master of the White Dragon, had descended.

The maids could not understand why the next Northern Grand Duchess was
paying respect to the sky, where an anomaly had occurred.

The Duchy of Astrea.

Gerald Astrea, a Sword Saint, was training as usual when he stopped and
stared at the brilliant light shining in the night sky with a sharp
gaze.

A powerful mana, so overwhelming that even he felt no will to oppose it,
was spreading across the world.

"The Nameless Hero perhaps..."

The Ducal House of Astrea owed a debt to the Nameless Hero.

However, as the man was concealing his identity, Gerald was waiting for
him to reveal himself first.

Gerald thought that it was time to start repaying his debt to him.

The East, Horan, Land of the Fire Blossoms.

In the Martial Imperial Court, Miya, a priestess with black hair, was
looking at the light illuminating the night sky.

"Mae, what is that light...?"

Miya asked Mae, the Nine-tailed Fox beside her.

The fox smiled wistfully.

**\[It seems our benefactor has revealed his true form.\]**

“…”

Miya, with a thoughtful expression, quietly watched the shining night
sky.

It was a beautiful light.

The Elfieto Imperial Court.

From the Imperial palace balcony, Emperor Carlos von Kairos Elfieto
looked up at the sky of the white night with his knights.

The Imperial Magic Tower investigated the cause of this anomaly. The
source of the immense power was not hidden, making it easy to determine
the cause.

The only problem was that, even upon direct observation, the cause was
hard to believe.

Soon, an Imperial Wizard hurried over and saluted the emperor.

"Speak. Who is in the sky?"

Normally jovial, Emperor Carlos, guessing that a serious situation had
occurred, asked the Imperial Wizard in a subdued voice. His gaze
remained fixed on the sky.

The Imperial Wizard sweated, a reaction born of profound awe. Skilled in
magic, he fully realized how incredible the current phenomenon was.

The Imperial Wizard cleared his throat silently and opened his mouth.

"The phenomenon of the white night originates from the magic of one
person..."

When Emperor Carlos shook his head, the Imperial Wizard stopped his
report.

"I’ll ask again."

The emperor's majestic gaze turned towards the Imperial Wizard.

"Now, who is the one ruling that sky?"

The Imperial Wizard swallowed dryly.

The Imperial Magic Tower observed the war occurring around Märchen
Academy. There, a man with three pairs of icy wings was radiating
brilliance.

Emperor Carlos had just one question. How should the empire define the
individual?

The Imperial Wizard organized his thoughts and spoke.

“…Some know him as the Nameless Hero. Others, as the Ice Sovereign. He
is the new Glacial Emperor. The Elemental King of Frost. But at the same
time, he is a student of Marchen Academy… A young boy by the name of
‘Isaac’.”

The balance of power that made up the world began to shift.

Emperor Carlos closed his eyes. He was not surprised. He had anticipated
this.

The Nameless hero was an unparalleled Archwizard. It was a natural
conclusion that he would become the Ice Sovereign, the pinnacle of the
element of ice.

Emperor Carlos thought of his daughter, Snow White.

Märchen Academy was guarded by Isaac. White's safety would be assured.
Although he did not trust Isaac, it was clear he was on the side of
humans.

"I will go to Märchen Academy."

Isaac was the pinnacle of humanity, stronger than any Elemental King.
The world revolved around him.

Last winter, the Imperial magic tower had detected that Isaac even
controlled the primordial magic beast of ice. Only the head of the
Imperial magic tower, two senior wizards, and the emperor knew this
information.

As the representative of the empire, it was necessary to meet such an
entity directly to maintain the nation’s stability and peace. There was
a need to act swiftly.

"Prepare the carriage immediately."

Emperor Carlos turned and walked away, his luxurious imperial robe
fluttered.

Meanwhile…

The fierce battle over the sea of ice was so grand that even the large
island housing Märchen Academy seemed insignificant in comparison.

Those on the island watched the war between the Ice Sovereign's army and
the demon army, including the Trump soldiers who had surrendered after
losing their reason to fight and the four captured Trump Paladins.

The island was protected by a translucent ice barrier cast by Isaac. The
battlefield surrounded the island, comprising the sky and the sea of
ice.

The knights of Düpfendorf and the ice monsters wrapped their weapons in
coldness to slice through or strike down the demons, while the ice
wizards wielded potent ice magic to shatter and freeze their enemies.

Frost Spirit Merphil unleashed a large-scale ice spell toward Freya the
Dark-Winged, waging an extensive battle.

The Glacial Bear Barbatoma and the Icebound Crocodile Tugaros unleashed
ice magic-infused punches toward Hamon the Gluttonous or breathed out
frosty blasts, tearing into their foes with tremendous biting power.

Massive explosions of mana occurred everywhere; had the battlefield not
been the sea, the area would have been completely devastated.

And in the sky…

*Kwagagagang!!*

Hilde launched the 8-star ice spell \[Hell of the Crimson Lotus\] toward
Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock.

The Nightmare Dragon countered with the 8-star neutral attribute magic
\[Phantasmal Flames\] wrapped in dark mana.

The collision of the ultra-cold silver beam and the dark purple,
mysterious flames caused a fierce explosion.

*Kwaaaaang!!*

The surroundings filled with cold steam.

The cold continued to sweep the sky. Any ordinary creature approaching
would lose its life.

*Saaaaa!!*

The Vorpal Sword's energy, which was enveloped in an enormous density of
mana, sliced through the steam. Isaac, spreading cold air, swung his
Frostscythe, clashing with the sword's energy.

The sword's energy was consumed by the cold and split by the scythe's
blade.

Isaac and Mephisto, deploying numerous magic circles, crossed the sky
pouring attacks on each other, causing all kinds of thunderous noises to
shake the heavens and the earth.

For those looking up at the sky from Märchen Academy, the scale of the
battle was so vast that it couldn't be fully captured in their field of
view.

*Swoosh!*

*Clash!*

Isaac ignored the repeatedly appearing level-up system window and
charged at Mephisto with terrifying speed.

Crossing the sky, he intercepted Mephisto with magic, dazzlingly
swinging his scythe. Within the relentless assault of ice magic,
continuous streaks of silver trails were etched into the world.

Complacency quickly led to death. Mephisto realized that even a mere
touch between weapons would certainly mean defeat.

Mephisto focused on dodging Isaac's graceful attacks and countering with
magic.

**\[Arrgh!!\]**

Isaac dominated the sky.

A deep cold pervaded Alice's body. Over time, her body slowed, and
underwent immense pain; her flesh froze, and her internal functions
began to shut down.

In contrast, Isaac was unharmed, exuding an air of ease. The only wounds
on his body were the ones he received in his fights against Zenon and
Alice. Mephisto and the Nightmare Dragon hadn’t managed to inflict any
damage thus far.

Mephisto retreated quickly while watching Isaac, extending the Vorpal
Sword upwards.

It gathered strength from its entire body. Mephisto gritted its teeth
and released its mana at maximum output.

*Kugugugugu!!*

The blade surged with dark red mana, elegantly unleashed a towering
sword energy. A whirlwind of mana spiraled in the sword's energy wake.

Behind Mephisto, Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock, stood guard, wrapped in
the flames that led creatures into an eternal nightmare, \[Phantasmal
Flames\].

Mephisto prepared to unleash his sword energy. It was a force capable of
splitting the sea of ice beyond the horizon. Anyone cut by the energy
from the sword would be ensnared into an eternal nightmare until their
death.

He wasn’t just aiming for Isaac; Glacial Bear Barbatoma, a chunk of the
forces of Düpfendorf's forces, and the island housing Märchen Academy
were all in the direct path of the sword energy.

*Can you block this without suffering any damage?*

Mephisto taunted Isaac with these words.

However, as the chill cleared and revealed Isaac's form, Mephisto was
left speechless.

Holding a scythe imbued with powerful ice mana, his wizard's robe
fluttered, turning his back against the white night's light. He looked
at Mephisto with emotionless eyes.

Behind him, the mythical White Dragon, Hilde, spread her white wings and
gathered mana. Faint blue coldness steamed off it.

Mephisto thought... it was an incredibly awe-inspiring sight.

A supreme being of unsurpassable power.

He was opposing him, harboring hostility. As the realization dawned on
him, Mephisto felt an uncontrollable terror.

The man's words about how he would find and kill Mephisto's true form
felt increasingly real.

...Such a thing would not happen. Mephisto tried to erase these needless
imaginations from his mind.

**\[You... must die here.\]**

Isaac. He was the man who had even vanquished the powerful Floating
Island, Cavillion the Earthshaker. He knew he was strong, but he had not
fully realized to what extent.

For the Evil God Nepid, Mephisto thought the man must certainly be dealt
with here.

Mephisto screamed and swung the Vorpal Sword.

The soaring sword energy was shot towards Isaac.

*Kwaaaaaaaa!!!*

A typhoon of sword energy rushed out like lightning, cutting through the
sky and the sea of ice with terrifying speed.

It was an immense sword energy. No matter how many strong wizards from
the empire gathered and layered protection magic, they could not stop
the path of this sword energy.

"Is that all you've got?"

However, Isaac's response to the sword energy was quite plain.

"...My turn."

*Swoooosh!!*

The Frostscythe was imbued with a high concentration of ice mana. Soon
after, Isaac swung the scythe forcefully, and a silver streak cut across
the sky diagonally.

Cold surged.

\[Absolute Zero\].

The scythe’s path cut through space unconstrained, and its unique skill,
which poured intense coldness, was cast.

*Chaaaaaaaah!!!*

**\[…!\]**

Nightmare Dragon Jabberwock swooped in with fierce momentum, spewed out
\[Phantasmal Flames\], and used its body to shield its master, following
Mephisto's command.

However, it was futile.

*Fwooooosh!!!*

The sword energy of the Vorpal Sword and the unique skill of the
Frostscythe intersected into an X shape.

Space itself cried out in agony as slashes erupted throughout the
heavens.

Consecutively, Mephisto felt a tingling sensation as its body seemed to
be sliced diagonally.

It intuitively knew that all the battles that could be fought with this
body were over.

**\[So, it has come to this…\]**

He had lost.

**\[...Heh.\]**

*...Within the body of the Queen of Hearts, that is.*

It wasn't over yet. Before freezing, Mephisto smirked.

The seal on the pocket watch, his last resort, was broken. Mephisto
could sense it.

A supreme demon, beyond even Mephisto's control, was now awakening.

<span id="0212_214_Alice_Subjugation_10.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 214: Alice Subjugation (10)
===================================

The Nightmare Dragon’s abdomen split more than half way open, and
through the crevice, a fierce coldness rushed in.

The dragon’s body froze solid and helplessly plummeted into the sea of
ice.

Alice’s body suffered the same fate. The unique skill of the
Frostscythe, \[Absolute Zero\], wasn’t constrained by space.

A powerful chill had seeped through the cuts in her body.

Alice’s body quickly froze over. It happened in the blink of an eye.

The crimson wings extending from her neck scattered, and the grotesque
arms behind her back turned into ashen dust and scattered in the wind.

The marks on her neck and face gradually faded.

Mephisto, no longer able to wield Alice’s mana, began to fall.

*Thud.*

Isaac swiftly flew to catch Alice, like a princess.

The power and fragments of Mephisto’s personality turned into ashen dust
and vanished, as Alice’s body, having suffered a mortal wound, was
entirely frozen, her bodily functions completely halted. She was
practically like a frozen human.

The last thing Mephisto could do was to create a grotesque eye and mouth
around Alice’s eye that had mana.

Now, that demon could no longer exert any power.

Mephisto looked at Isaac with an eye created by mana. The eye held a
chillingly cold gaze that seemed to freeze even the heart.

Mephisto let out a hollow laugh.

\[**It’s a pity…. I couldn’t defeat you with the body of the Queen of
Hearts…\]**

As Mephisto’s mana waned, the demon minions could not exert their full
strength. This led to the dominance of the disaster-level ice beasts and
the Düpfendorf army.

The shouts of Düpfendorf grew louder. Eventually, Freya the Dark-Winged,
having sustained a fatal injury, plummeted into the ice sea, and Hamon
the Gluttonous collapsed. They all turned into ashen dust and
disappeared.

The war would soon be over.

…It seemed so at that moment.

\[**But you know… this isn’t the only trick I have up my sleeve.\]**

Mephisto chuckled with the last mouth it had left.

**\[Oh Nameless Hero, please listen to this story…\]**

*Whooooooo!!!*

Suddenly, an immense dark mana filled the space above Isaac’s head. The
color was pitch black.

Isaac squinted and lifted his head.

*Paaaaaat!*

The dark mana swelled and quickly spread in all directions, driving away
the White Night.

Isaac swiped away the level-up system window that appeared before him
and quietly observed the dark mana filling the sky.

Despite the Düpfendorf army having wiped out the demon army, they didn’t
shout but instead looked up at the sky in silence. Tension rippled
through the sea of ice.

\[**Among the humans who made a contract with me, there was a foolish
woman who desired to become the most beautiful in the entire world…\]**

Mephisto licked her lips.

**Through our contract, the woman gained exceptional beauty, became
famous, and won the heart of the emperor. She later became the
empress.**

Only Isaac illuminated the pitch black sky. was the only one shining in
the pitch-black sky.

It was a radiance of sheer solitude.

Mephisto continued in a hoarse voice.

\[**Then, the mirror answered. It said that Princess Snow White was
prettier than her… she was her daughter. Angered by its response, the
woman sought to kill her daughter, simply because she was prettier… But
after repeatedly failing in her assassination attempts, she came back to
me. Her heart, already stained with anger, resentment, and inferiority,
wished for her daughter’s eternal misery…\]**

Dorothy, who defeated the Phantom Cat Cheshire, Kaya, who defeated the
Tiger Dragon Bandersnatch, Luce riding the Thunderbird, and many others
at Märchen Academy, all looked up at the sky.

A profound sense of dread washed over them.

“Isaac!!”

“Isaac…!”

“Sir Isaac!!”

Their instincts warned them of the impending danger.

No matter how capable Isaac was, in the face of such a force, his
survival couldn’t be guaranteed.

Dorothy, who was in the sky, flew toward Isaac. Luce, riding the
Thunderbird, and Kaya left the protective barrier deployed over the
island and flew towards Isaac as well.

It was a reflexive behavior. Their instincts screamed that they must
quickly grab Isaac and flee.

*“Kugh!”*

*“Ugh!!”*

They were forced to stop and hold on as the pitch-black sky unleashed an
astronomical amount of mana like a storm.

That was just from releasing mana.

\[**Lastly, I gave the woman a clock. This clock contained a terrifying
demon capable of subjecting Snow White to a fate worse than death.
Sealed within it… was a demon endowed with the power to live forever in
a bottomless prison… The woman was really pleased. To think her daughter
would remain in eternal agony. Haha… Thinking about it again, it was
truly a delightful reaction. I gave it to her thinking she could
leisurely release the creature before the resurrection of Lord Nephid,
as she was a human who had pleased me…\]**

The pocket watch that Mephisto gave to the Empress.

It was the platinum watch that Snow White had treasured as a gift from
her mother.

\[**But I didn’t expect someone like you to appear. So I decided to
release it earlier than planned… It took some time to loosen the reins
because that creature was something even I couldn't control…\]**

Joy sparked in Mephisto’s eyes.

\[**As soon as it’s released, it will devour Snow White. It will devour
other humans too, and finally, you, who will fall into despair…! It’s
too late to stop it now. Hehe, what a delightful turn of events…!\]**

Mephisto grinned with the last mouth it had left.

**Farewell, Oh Nameless Hero… May you have a pleasant journey… in the
eternal prison…**

Isaac lowered his head and looked at Mephisto again.

Caught up in her own story, Mephisto saw Isaac’s expression and widened
her remaining eye. Mephisto’s fading mouth couldn’t continue speaking.

On Isaac’s face looking back at it… there was, somehow, a faint smile.

*Whooooo!!*

The pitch-black sky spread a biting wind filled with dark mana.

Dorothy deployed a powerful starlight protective shield, Luce, along
with the Thunderbird, created a highly condensed \[Thunder God’s
Barrier\], and Kaya used the power of blood and plants to form the
\[Blood Tree\] to protect those around her.

However, the biting wind of darkness effortlessly penetrated even those
defenses, leaving numerous cuts on their bodies.

The island was precariously protected by Isaac’s frost barrier.

Isaac, who was closest to the pitch-black sky, endured the powerful cold
with the increased \[Wind Elemental Resistance\] from his bracelet,
maintaining his position.

The elemental bracelet had been set that way from the beginning, because
Isaac didn’t know when “that demon” Mephisto mentioned would emerge.

Isaac had anticipated this situation.

“Didn’t I tell you?”

Isaac’s voice was as cold as frost.

“That I would find you and kill you.”

\[**You can’t be serious…?\]**

*Even feeling this transcendental mana… you’re saying you’ll defeat the
“Abyss”?*

“Wait for it.”

Isaac looked into Mephist’s eyes with murderous intent.

“I’ll kill that bastard first, then I’m coming for you.”

*Whaaaaack!!!*

From the pocket of Isaac’s robe, a thick dark mana seeped out. Many eyes
flashed as the pitch-black mana carved into the air, targeting the
bodies of Isaac and Alice.

Why was the “Abyss”, which was supposed to emerge by devouring Snow
White, springing out from Isaac? Mephisto felt tremendous confusion.

\[**Why do you have that clock…?\]**

As if he knew all along what would happen, Isaac had the clock
containing the Abyss that was meant for Snow White.

Amidst the intense torrent of questions, Mephisto’s last remaining eye
and mouth could no longer endure and completely disintegrated into ashen
dust.

Only Alice, whose body was frozen, remained in Isaac’s arms.

Isaac tightly embraced Alice with one hand and with the other, he pulled
out the pocket watch. It was Snow White’s watch. Once platinum, it had
now turned black.

The watch, which had sealed the demon known as the Abyss, was the leash.
Finally, that leash had been set free, and the creature had regained its
freedom.

Isaac released the watch. Emitting a stream of dark mana, it floated up
into the sky.

Eventually, the pitch-black sky opened wide like a gaping maw.

\[Om the Eternal\] **Lv:** ■■■ **Race:** De■ **Elements:** Darkness,
Wind, Eternity **Danger:** Ext■ **Psychology:** \[■\]

The demon “Om the Eternal”, commonly known as the “Abyss”.

One of the highest-ranking demons. It was an enemy that should not have
appeared yet.

Isaac recalled his memories.

White’s clock was already preparing to release the Abyss.

As Mephisto himself had said, it was because of the Nameless Hero.

Upon hearing that the Floating Island had died, Mephisto began to
release the seal of the Abyss prematurely to keep the Nameless Hero,
Isaac, in check.

Isaac had been regularly checking the clock as the seal was being
released. He judged that it was about time for the Abyss to emerge.

The timing was perfect. Mephisto had probably planned for the decisive
battle today.

Seeing Mephisto’s reaction, Isaac was completely sure that the Abyss
would burst out today.

Isaac looked at the pitch-black sky, at the Abyss. His eyes were filled
with a fighting spirit.

The Abyss, a pitch-black entity, was excited to face Isaac, a delectable
prey and a formidable adversary. That emotion was conveyed to Isaac.

Isaac spoke calmly.

“Alright let’s fight.”

「Act 9, Alice Subjugation」.

*Let the final battle begin.*

*Guuuuuu!!*

*Crack!*

The Abyss, Om the Eternal, engulfed Isaac and Alice.

A deep shadow fell on the faces of Dorothy, Luce, and Kaya as they flew
toward them.

In an instant, the enormous mana surrounding Isaac disappeared as if it
were a lie.

<span id="0213_215_Alice_Subjugation_11.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 215: Alice Subjugation (11)
===================================

Four days have passed since Isaac was devoured by The Abyss.

The dark sky still stretched over the sea.

However, unlike at the beginning, it was no longer appropriate to call
it complete darkness. It had taken on a perfect form, flaunting its
dazzling mana imitating the starry sky adorned with the Milky Way.

Due to the demon blocking the sunlight, an early cold visited Märchen
Academy. Those remaining on the island had to dig out their winter
clothes.

Most people, including students, faculty, residents, and tower wizards,
evacuated from the island to escape the dark skies.

Princess Snow White was forcibly taken away in a carriage by some
Imperial Knights, including Merlin Astrea, under an Imperial Order to
protect her.

Saintess Bianca Anturaze remained at the church and prayed daily.
Although the Pope sent a letter ordering her to evacuate, Bianca firmly
refused, evacuating only the Priests and Believers. However, the Escort
priest, Sylon, stayed by her side.

Bianca awaited The Nameless Hero, Isaac. She felt compelled to deliver
the mysterious book she had found to him, believing it to be the will of
the Lord, Manhalla.

Moreover, there were others who remained at the academy.

First, faculty who felt a sense of duty remained as well as a very
miniscule amount of students. These students were Dorothy, Luce, Kaya,
and the Saintess.

Second, the Imperial Knights were entrusted with the protection of the
empire.

Third, the Hegel Tower Master.

Fourth, Düpfendorf forces and the ice magic beasts, who were guarding
the island after winning the war against the demon army. They were
Isaac's minions.

Fifth, the four paladins and Alice's familiars were detained in prison.
These accomplices in the current crisis were restrained with handcuffs
or ropes that interfered with mana circulation

The Trump soldiers all disappeared somewhere. Since it was impossible to
track all of them, they could only restrain and imprison the Paladins
and Alice's familiars.

For four nights, Dorothy, Luce, and Kaya desperately unleashed their
strongest spells toward The Abyss, sacrificing sleep in the process.
They overused their mana to the point of bleeding from their noses,
driven by the thought that Isaac was inside that dark creature.

Similarly, the Imperial Knights also launched an all-out assault on The
Abyss for four days.

Ian Fairytale helped by relentlessly unleashing light element attacks.

The remaining students and Düpfendorf's forces tried all kinds of
tactical attacks together.

However, it was futile. The demon, not even tickled by their attacks,
merely continued to imitate the starry sky.

Eventually, the situation led to evacuating Ian and waiting for the
empire's strongest force, the Subjugation Force.

"What are you planning to do?"

Department of Magic, Orphin Hall.

In the reception room, Headmistress Elena Woodline and Professor
Fernando Frost sat facing each other.

Fernando had come to discuss with Elena what to do regarding the
colossal being floating in the sky.

"The students? Have they all evacuated?"

Fernando shook his head.

There were a total of four students left at the academy.

Dorothy Heartnova, Luce Eltania, Kaya Astrea, and Saintess Bianca
Anturaze.

Fernando persistently urged the students to flee for four days, but they
completely ignored his pleas.

Even the Saintess locked herself in the church, blocking everyone's
access, which left no opportunity to even speak with her.

"Haa. So? How are the kids doing?"

"Luce Eltania and Kaya Astrea should be resting. Aside from the problem
of overusing their mana, they seemed to be in a poor mental state. As
for Dorothy Heartnova..."

Fernando paused, pondering how to explain, before speaking.

"To be honest, she is in a very dangerous condition."

Elena was puzzled.

"What? Why? What happened?"

"If she were a normal person, she would have to be prepared for death
due to severe fever, and she sometimes shows signs of seizures. The
backlash from overusing starlight magic is so severe that even healing
magic isn’t working."

Fernando looked sympathetic as he recalled Dorothy's suffering.

"We are currently forcing her to rest with the cooperation of the
Imperial Knights."

"Wait, wait! Why did this happen to her...?"

"We suspect it's a side effect of starlight mana."

Dorothy poured out her magic with all her might at The Abyss for four
days and four nights.

Eventually, her overwhelming emotions and the overuse of starlight mana
drove her into the worst physical condition.

Starlight mana was a special power bestowed by the Star Fairy. No one
knew what the exact side effects were when the power was abused.

What was certain was that Dorothy's physical condition was so serious
that it would not have been surprising if she had died at any moment.

"Dorothy..." Elena said with a worried expression..

"Actually... I don't really know."

"What do you mean?"

"The Nameless Hero, no, he has revealed his identity now. Yes, Isaac.
Even he couldn't do anything and was devoured. That extraordinary
archwizard."

Now it was widely known that the nameless hero was Isaac. The news must
have reached the imperial family as well.

"I can't think of escaping because I don't know if he is safe... After
all, he is also our academy student..."

"...Is that so."

"I'm sorry, Professor Frost. It's shameful that someone like me, the
Headmistress, is showing such weakness."

Elena, as the Headmistress, felt a heavy responsibility. She would not
allow herself to choose the option of escaping first while leaving even
one academy student behind.

Fernando sighed.

"…Emperor Carlos was on his way here in person. That extraordinary visit
was interrupted due to the appearance of the demon in the sky."

"Yes."

"He should be staying in a nearby estate by now. If we flee here, we
won't be far from receiving the strong protection of the imperial
forces. Moreover, you, as the Headmistress, are recognized by the
Imperial family."

Fernando turned his head to look out the window. The demon still filled
the sky, imitating the starry night.

"And since the strongest force, The Subjugation Force of the empire is
on its way here, you will be forced to leave anyway. It's only a matter
of time before we have to leave this academy."

The Subjugation Force, a unit comprised of the Imperial Guard, regarded
as the empire’s most formidable military force, was undoubtedly one of
the strongest forces in the empire.

They were rushing to defeat the demon in the sky because the area where
Isaac was devoured was directly above the island.

If the Subjugation Force arrived, the place would turn into a
battlefield.

The academy, which many had grown attached to, would soon succumb to all
the challenges it had faced.

However, this didn't mean that Märchen Academy would disappear. With the
support of the empire and investors, another Märchen Academy was being
built.

Until the new campus was completed, education could only continue in
temporary facilities, so Märchen Academy would not disappear.

"Therefore, I would like you, as the Headmistress, to focus first on
making sure you survive."

"Professor Frost, what about you?"

"Unlike you, I am just a mere professor. If even one student decides to
remain here, I intend to stay until the end."

"You are really stubborn... What was I even thinking talking to someone
like you..."

Elena thought and sighed.

If the demon above tried to destroy the academy before the Subjugation
Force arrived, Elena would cast protection magic to protect the
remaining people.

It was a power that could distort even the most formidable attacks.
Perhaps she could somehow block at least one attack from the demon
imitating the starry sky.

\*\*\*

Märchen Academy Detention Center. Press Room.

The Imperial Knights decided to interrogate the four paladins
separately. They kept them in separate buildings, each a significant
distance from one another, that served as temporary detention centers.

The paladins, all highly skilled in magic, posed a risk if kept too
close together, as they might unexpectedly utilize their powers. Just
restraining them with handcuffs that interfered with mana circulation
was not reassuring enough.

The Clover Paladin, Pierre Flanche did not respond at all to the
Imperial Knight's questioning. Pierre, who was always cheerful, now wore
a very expressionless face.

The other paladins felt the same. They had failed, and ultimately, Queen
Alice had been devoured by the demon.

All the paladins were so overwhelmed by a piercing sense of loss that
they were left speechless.

"So, you won't reveal anything? Not your motives for this incident, nor
your true identities?"

As the Imperial Knight asked with an angry face, Pierre Flanche squeezed
out a voice.

"...Kill me."

"What?"

It was an answer from someone who had already given up on everything.

"It's all my fault. You can torture me. I don't mind if you display my
head in Viyans plaza."

Viyans was the capital of the Zelver Empire.

"So just... kill me."

Having failed their mission and set to lose everything, they had even
caused the emergence of the powerful demon that now filled the night
sky.

They had no choice but to atone with painful screams and death. No, they
wanted to. Otherwise, they felt they could not endure the loss and
guilt.

The other paladins felt the same. They had long resolved to lay
everything down upon failure. They wished to die soon, to atone, and to
serve their Queen in the afterlife.

...It was then.

*Boom!!*

A brilliant explosion blasted the press room door, crumpling it like
paper.

The Imperial knight, startled, jumped to his feet and immediately drew
his sword.

The person who entered the press room was a female student with light
purple hair.

Among the strongest in the empire, she was considered Märchen Academy's
greatest force. She was Dorothy Heartnova.

She was drenched in sweat, gasping for air, and clutching her head in
pain. Her face was twisted with the agony of a fever and a headache so
severe that it could have killed an ordinary person.

Dorothy glared at Pierre.

Having not slept for four days and the continuous casting of spells,
combined with her dreadful physical condition, Dorothy's appearance bore
no trace of her former vitality.

"Should I...? Should I just kill you...?"

Dorothy spoke, her voice mixed with ragged breaths.

Chapter 216: Alice Subjugation (12)
===================================

“Is anyone out there?!”

The Imperial Knight shouted urgently, but no response came from the
hallway. It was because Dorothy had knocked out all the Imperial Knights
who had tried to stop her.

Dorothy was like a ticking time bomb. Märchen Academy treated her like a
student in name only, but once she lost her reason and went berserk, she
was a formidable force difficult to control.

Only Alice Carroll had naturally served as her restrainer. But now, she
was gone.

Pierre looked at Dorothy with a startled face. Suddenly, a burst of
force lifted him off the ground and slammed him against the wall.

*Baaam!!*

*“Ugh!!”*

Dorothy grabbed her head with her left hand and stretched out her right
arm. Immediately, Pierre’s body was pulled into her hand, and she
grabbed him by the throat.

Pierre’s head was bleeding. He was in agony from being choked. Dorothy
glared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“You tried to kill Isaac during the Grand Festival, didn’t you? What
gave you the nerve to come crawling back? Did I go too easy on you…?”

*“Kuuugh…!”*

“Fortunately… even a bastard like you is useful now… Let’s postpone
death a bit, shall we…?”

Pierre could only gasp for air, unable to breathe.

Dorothy’s fever and headache ragged her breathing, her voice kept
cracking and her sentences were broken.

“Dorothy Heartnova! What the hell are you doing?!”

“Shut your mouth.”

*“Kugh!”*

*Kuuuuu!*

A strong gravitational pull settled over the head of the Imperial
Knight. The ground distorted. The knight gritted his teeth and endured
the excruciating pain that threatened to crush his body.

He couldn’t move. Dorothy had strengthened the gravitational pull just
enough to keep him immobilized.

“The only business I have… is with this bastard… He was nowhere to be
found, so I came looking for him myself…”

“Are you out of your mind?!”

The Knight shouted, eyes wide open.

Dorothy hadn’t slept for days and had been unleashing starlight magic at
the Abyss. As a result, she was in a state where she could die at any
moment. It was probably because her starlight mana had been congested.

*Regardless, has she finally lost her mind?*

*No, that isn’t it.*

*That alone isn’t what had driven Dorothy to this point.*

Despite his anger, the Imperial Knight was also worried about Dorothy.
Even if she was one of the strongest in the Empire, she was still just a
student.

However, Dorothy was now out of control and crossing the line, which was
why the knight had decided to threaten her forcefully.

Dorothy narrowed her eyes.

Even if all the remaining Imperial Knights at Märchen Academy were to
attack at once, they wouldn’t be able to defeat her.

But the Slayers were converging this way. Soon, they would reach the
land bridge.

Even Dorothy could not defeat them. In other words, if she made enemies
of the Empire, Dorothy's safety couldn’t be guaranteed.

But Dorothy didn’t care.

“I have no grudge against you… To me… Isaac is the most important…”

“You really…!”

“To save Isaac!!”

Dorothy shouted.

“I need these bastards…!”

Even though her head felt like it was splitting apart, Isaac’s face and
voice were still clear in her mind.

For Dorothy, Isaac was more important than the law.

Isaac had become Dorothy’s world. He had given her a future when she was
facing death.

To Dorothy, Isaac was far more precious than her own insignificant life
that should have already ended before.

Even using \[Last Light of a Dying Star\], a starlight spell that used
her very own life as fuel for its overwhelming power, might not have
been enough to make it up to him.

Of course, Isaac also harbored a strong power within him… But there was
still a limit to the power he could use. Being on Isaac’s side, Dorothy
was aware of this.

Moreover, when Isaac was captured, his mana was also consumed. This was
obvious to anyone on the island at the time, as his mana had
dramatically dwindled.

That was why Dorothy became impatient and changed her mind.

She would take the four Paladins and go to their world. She would use
them as guides to find the one who summoned the demon in the sky. That
was the idea.

The starlight mana flowing in her circuit boiled furiously. Her body
felt like it was melting. However, this sensation elevated Dorothy to a
higher realm.

Now, she was confident that she could take a few people with her to
intervene in another world bathed in starlight.

It was a growth that came from four days of emotional turmoil and
excessive use of starlight mana.

Dorothy decided to find the main body of the demon that had possessed
Alice’s body and learn how to counter the Abyss from it. She knew that
the demon inside Alice was not the real body, thanks to the power of
\[All in the World\].

It didn’t matter if she was weaker than that demon. She could always
exchange her lifespan for a powerful starlight spell.

*“Kuuuugh…!”*

Dorothy suffered from a headache as if numerous daggers were
continuously stabbing her brain.

At the same time, she felt a strange sensation akin to levitating in the
air and a sense of omnipotence. It was as if she could do anything.

She had been seeing hallucinations that something was reaching out to
her.

And if she took that hand… she had a foreboding feeling that she would
be dragged to a distant place from which she could never return.

That was why Dorothy ignored the hallucination.

*Booooom!!*

Dorothy smashed through prison walls, floating Pierre in the air.

She flew at a terrifying speed and reached the central square of the
Academy.

She knocked down the walls of other buildings that served as makeshift
prisons with starlight magic, sending only the Paladins flying toward
her. She had already pinpointed their locations, making such a feat easy
to perform.

*“Ugh!”*

*“Kugh…!”*

*“Kugugh!”*

The Spade Paladin, Zenon.

The Heart Paladin, Shera Hectorica.

The Diamond Paladin, Alexa.

Like Pierre, they floated around Dorothy, dressed in straitjackets.

A commotion arose with a clanging noise. All four Paladins seemed to be
grasped by an invisible force, choking and struggling in pain.

“Dorothy Heartnova! What are you doing?!”

“Will you stop this immediately?!”

The Imperial Knights reacted quickly and surrounded Dorothy with weapons
drawn. Headmistress Elena Woodline and the Professors from Orphin Hall
were taken aback by Dorothy’s sudden actions and immediately headed to
the square.

A Slayer composed of the Royal Guards was currently crossing the land
bridge. The Imperial Knights wanted to avoid unnecessary chaos during
such a time.

Dorothy’s lifeless eyes scanned the knights who were pointing weapons at
her.

*Hwaaaa!!*

Soon, a distinct radiance flowed from Dorothy’s body.

The power of \[All in the World\] and the transcendent ability to
traverse worlds filled with starlight attempted to erase her and the
Paladins from the Academy Square. The Imperial Knights were astonished
by the mysterious sight.

Over the past four days, Dorothy had been using her powers of
observation to track which world the foot soldiers had been sent back
to. In addition to pouring her power into the Abyss, this was the undue
task she had undertaken.

The Imperial Knights rushed in and unleashed their attacks to stop her.

“Don’t… interfere…!”

However, Dorothy’s colorful starlight magic blocked all their attacks
and pushed them back.

At that moment.

Purple lightning struck Dorothy.

*Kwagagagang!!*

*Claaaang!!*

Dorothy deployed a starlight shield to block the lightning. However, the
intensity of the lightning disrupted her concentration.

The glow emanating from Dorothy faded. Her gaze wavered and then turned
toward the female student who had struck her with lightning.

The Vice-Commander of the Imperial Knight, Magrio, gently raised his arm
to stop the knights. He wanted to observe the situation.

“I hated you from the start.”

A female student with rose-gold hair nonchalantly walked past the
Imperial Knights and stopped in front of Dorothy.

A student from the Magic Department who, like Dorothy, had spent four
sleepless nights pouring magic onto the Abyss.

It was Luce Eltania.

“What do you think you’re doing?”

Luce asked Dorothy. She was like an emotionless doll, yet a cold
cynicism could be felt from her expression and voice.

Dorothy, clutching her splitting head, gasped for air as she glared at
Luce.

Both girls had dark shadows under their eyes.

<span id="0215_217_Alice_Subjugation_13.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 217: Alice Subjugation (13)
===================================

Before long, Headmistress Elena Woodline, along with a few remaining
professors, had ridden a familiar and arrived at the Academy Plaza.

Vice Commander Magrio stepped in front of them and quietly suggested
they watch the situation unfold. Headmistress Elena nodded her head,
sweating nervously.

In the middle of the Plaza, Luce, and Dorothy both looked unwell. A
murderous intent filled their eyes and they appeared as if they could
kill each other at any moment.

It was a connection formed through Isaac. The two disliked each other.
Although Dorothy had always been kind towards her, it would be a stretch
to say their relationship was even remotely good.

"Why... do you try to take them away without saying anything? Who are
you to do that?"

Luce hated the Paladins enough to want to kill them.

She couldn't let Dorothy take away those detestable people as she
pleased.

"Luce Elta- Ugh!!"

Dorothy tried to cry out Luce's name but felt a severe headache as if
her head was being hacked to pieces. A groan of pain escaped her lips.

Starlight mana seethed like a furnace, bubbling intensely. This was
perhaps even more pronounced because she had tried to wield transcendent
power just moments ago. It showed no signs of calming down.

Starlight mana leaked, causing a swarm of stars. Dorothy gritted her
teeth trying to suppress the mana, but the chaotic surge of mana was
more than she more than she could handle.

Wrapped in a swarm of stars, Dorothy, breathing roughly, soon struggled
to speak.

"I will find a way to cut through the demon's belly... For that, I need
a guide... To find where the one who summoned that demon is...!"

"How can you be sure it will go as you think?"

"There's nothing else I can do... for Isaac...!"

Isaac wasn’t perfect. So, Dorothy was convinced that she could make up
for his imperfections.

But in the end, Isaac was devoured by a demon stronger than the Floating
Island.

Dorothy felt a relentless stirring of helplessness and self-reproach in
her heart.

It was to the point that her emotional distress intensified the potency
of the starlight mana and caused her pain, thus making it impossible for
her to calm down.

Luce scoffed.

"Does it hurt so much it's made you stupider than usual?."

"What...?"

Dorothy glared at the provoking Luce with murderous eyes, but Luce
remained calm.

Luce gently blinked, then slightly bowed her head and pursed her lips.

"Isaac will come back. He's stronger than anyone."

"..."

"Stop this nonsense and hole yourself up in your room. If you keep doing
such stupid things and the empire ends up turning against you, what of
Isaac then?"

Luce said in a sardonic tone.

If Isaac did not return, regardless of the Imperial Investigative
Authority, the Paladins would die by her hand.

But Luce decided to believe that Isaac would return. It seemed
unbearable believe he wouldn’t.

Therefore, she assumed Isaac would return and thought accordingly.

"If Isaac is saddened because of you, the only thought that will fill my
mind is of killing you, Dorothy."

Dorothy flinched and struggled to clear her pain-clouded mind.

She acknowledged she hadn't considered Isaac's feelings.

But despite that, all she wanted now was to save him. Dorothy thought
that rescuing him was the priority.

Dorothy wanted to voice hopeful words like Luce.

But... no matter how much she thought about it, the demon above was too
strong. As mentioned before, the power of \[All In the World\] had made
that clear.

Because of that, she became impatient.

So, she had to do her best to save Isaac.

"Still, I... Ah...!"

The starlight that had been flowing in Dorothy's eyes flickered vividly

Something that appeared dreamly in Dorothy's vision suddenly grabbed her
hand forcefully.

*Paaaaah!!*

Her starlight mana began to bubble like molten hot lava.

A chilling mana spread from Dorothy.

The only thing Dorothy could manage to do before succumbing the pain was
to cast a starlight barrier to protect the Paladins who could be the
guides to Wonderland, the innocent Luce, the Imperial Knights, and the
faculty members who had come to the plaza.

"Guh, ugh!!"

Dorothy screamed. She clutched her head with both hands and screamed.

Luce and the Imperial Knights were all shocked. They reflexively took up
combat stances.

Stars filled the Plaza, and the strange mana settled like gravity. The
structures and stage of the plaza were shattered and crushed.

*Chararang!!*

Around Dorothy, a swarm of stars violently rose. The colorful swarm of
stars gradually became duller.

At first glance, Dorothy's body reflected through the star cluster, and
several eyes shone out. Luce couldn’t understand what this phenomenon
could be.

On the top floor of the Hegel Magic Tower. Aria Lillias, while alone in
the tower, felt Dorothy's mana. Feeling strong anxiety, she hurriedly
left the tower and headed for the Academy Plaza.

The Düpfendorf forces guarding the island also turned their heads in
Dorothy’s direction.

Even the demon imitating the night sky writhed. The demon, who had been
still for four days, reacted to the strange mana Dorothy was emitting.

"Just what the hell are you...?"

Luce quietly voiced her question as she watched Dorothy struggling to
suppress her starlight mana.

The Star Fairy, Stella.

Fairies were beings shrouded in mystery. Like demons, their origins and
the reasons for their special powers were unknown.

Among them, if asked who the most mysterious fairy was, everyone would
unanimously say the Star Fairy.

The starlight element was a power that manipulated all kinds of physical
forces. It was hard to deny that it possessed the greatest potential and
destructive power among all elements.

The existence of such a powerful Star Fairy was known only because of a
girl said to have received the power of starlight in the distant past
and a prodigious genius named Dorothy Heartnova.

The first Starlight Wizard suddenly disappeared one day.

On that day, records indicate that tsunamis and typhoons struck the
world.

Luce quietly gathered her mana, recalling the story told by the Candy
House Witch.

She realized that starlight mana was not entirely on Dorothy's side.

Then she had to stop Dorothy, who was on the verge of losing control,
right here and now.

*Kiiiaaaaah!!*

Above Luce, lightning branched out in hundreds of directions, revealing
Thunderbird Galia. Luce summoned lightning with the aid of the
Thunderbird.

"Don't resent me if this hurts. I intend to subdue you."

Luce, along with the Imperial Knights, deployed a magic circle. However,
they were sweating coldly, for the superiority in power was clear.

Nevertheless, everyone gathered in the Academy Plaza instinctively felt
that if they did not subdue Dorothy now, something terrible would
happen.

A tense situation.

It was then.

*Kwagagang!!*

A purple lightning bolt streaked across the sea and fell before Luce,
taking the form of a man.

*Bazzzzt!*

A man with dark purple hair quickly deployed a lightning magic circle in
an instant and stretched out his arm toward Dorothy. His eyes, flowing
like an electric current, locked on Dorothy.

The Elemental King of Lightning. The Lighting Sovereign, “Jaul
Dragoniac”.

Luce, the Thunderbird, the Imperial Knights, Headmistress Elena, and the
faculty were greatly startled by the arrival of the Lightning Sovereign.

"W-why is the Lightning Sovereign here...?!"

*Fwooooosh!!*

Following that, a fireball flew at tremendous speed and fell onto the
Academy Plaza, it burst into flames and transformed into a human form.

An elderly man with a full snowy white beard, dressed in a wizard's
robe, had his hood pulled down over his head and deployed a fire magic
circle while leaning on his magic staff.

With a serious face, his eyes, filled with flame, focused on Dorothy.

The Elemental King of Fire. The Fire Sovereign, “Andersen Versando”.

*Puuahhhh!!*

A whirlpool of water rose from the sea, crossed the sky, and struck down
into the Academy Plaza.

With a click, the whirlpool vanished and the water mana spread
beautifully, revealing an elegant woman with navy blue hair.

She deployed a water element magic circle and looked at Dorothy with her
aquamarine eyes, a faint smile on her lips.

The Elemental King of Water. The Water Sovereign, “Siren Silivian”.

*Whooosh!!*

A light green tornado stretched out and poured into the Academy Plaza.

The tornado instantly condensed and was grasped in the hands of a short
girl who landed on the spot.

She was a girl wearing an eyepatch over her right eye and a hat.

She deployed a wind magic circle and created a large wind bow, aiming an
arrow of light green mana at Dorothy.

Holding the bow was a large arm made of mana, crafted from condensed
wind.

The girl stood still, looking at Dorothy expressionlessly.

The Elemental King of Wind. The Wind Sovereign, “Erin Campbell”.

The pinnacle of each element and the strongest humans in the world. The
sight of the four Elemental Kings gathered as if they had made an
agreement left the onlookers speechless.

Luce felt their mana. Each one of them possessed immense mana, its depth
was unfathomable.

Even she, who wielded the Thunderbird, felt like mere dust before them.

The Elemental Kings, each maintaining a distance, surrounded Dorothy.
All were wary of her.

"How did the Elemental Kings appear all at once...?"

"Run."

When Vice Commander of the Imperial Knights Magrio questioned, Fire
Sovereign Andersen responded solemnly.

"If something like that goes berserk, who knows what could happen."

Dorothy was still groaning and suffering, unable to control her
starlight mana.

"We thought to stop the demon in the sky if the empire fails in its
subjugation... but not you, Dorothy Heartnova. If you can't suppress
that mana right now, we don't know what disaster may strike."

Dorothy's name was world-famous. She had received the blessings of the
Lord Manhalla and was chosen by the Star Fairy. The Elemental Kings were
all well aware of her.

Since the Ice Sovereign revealed himself, the Elemental Kings had been
keeping a watchful eye on Märchen Academy. They all came here together
upon sensing the chilling mana emanating from Dorothy.

If Dorothy couldn't suppress her mana and it were to run wild…

the Elemental Kings couldn't predict how dangerous a being might emerge.

"It feels unsatisfactory to do this to a student... Hey kid, can you try
to calm down? We don't want to be doing this either."

The elegant woman, Water Sovereign Siren, said this with a kind smile.

In contrast, Lightning Sovereign Jaul couldn't say a word. He only
furrowed his brows.

*That...?*

Jaul recalled the unknown being with many eyes hidden within Isaac.

The intimidating aura the being emitted... was now being felt from the
rampaging Dorothy. Jaul felt a sense of discord from this fact.

It felt as if Dorothy was in the process of becoming such an entity.

“...?”

Luce moved even closer to Dorothy. Thanks to the starlight protective
barrier, she could approach safely.

The intense and erratic gravity around Dorothy would have distorted
anybody who approached without protection.

Luce turned her back to Dorothy and extended her arms to the sides.

The onlookers in the Plaza were greatly alarmed by this, and Dorothy was
startled as well.

"Honestly, I don't even understand what's happening, and I dislike you.
But still..."

Thunderbird shot into the sky, spreading flashes of lightning. He was
solely following his master's will.

Luce showed her determination to the Elemental Kings.

"If something happens to you, wouldn't Isaac be sad?"

While that was a valid reason, Luce hoped that no misfortune would
befall Dorothy.

After Isaac, she was the one she could most easily talk to. Although
there were still aspects of her she disliked, it wasn't as if she
outright hated Dorothy.

Thus, Luce had chosen to stand by Dorothy without hesitation.

Dorothy, gasping for breath and in agony, watched Luce's back with her
eyes bulging with strained blood vessels. She wanted to scream at her to
get away, but she couldn't muster the voice to do so.

"...I'm sorry about this."

Wind Sovereign Erin said calmly with her eyes closed. She didn't know
how close Luce and Dorothy were, but she couldn't just stand by and
watch Dorothy's rampage.

Dorothy needed to be subdued. The will of the Elemental Kings were
unified, and the magic circle they deployed emitted a powerful light.

At that moment.

The storm settled.

*Whooooo!!!*

Suddenly, a sharp blood-wind swept around Dorothy and Luce, as if intent
on protecting them.

It was a wind so sharp that it could slice through flesh upon contact.

The wind magic was intended as a threat, so it harmed no one. However,
because of the wind, the Elemental Kings ceased their magic and observed
the situation.

A girl with light green hair landed near Luce and Dorothy. With
bloodshot eyes, she scanned the Elemental Kings, her expression
hardened.

It was Kaya Astrea. She too appeared worn out, having not slept for four
days.

Kaya casted \[Blood Tree\] around herself and Dorothy to protect them
from the overflowing starlight mana.

She attempted to heal Dorothy while resisting the rebellious starlight
mana.

And then, taking a deep breath, she shouted loudly.

"Can't you all sense it?!!"

Just moments ago, Kaya had been near The Abyss because she didn't want
to rest without doing anything.

And just now, she had faintly felt the burgeoning ice mana emanating
from the demon in the starry sky.

Kaya extended her right arm upwards, pointing at the demon.

"In the sky!! Ice mana!!"

The people in the Plaza, except for the Elemental Kings, didn't
understand what Kaya was saying. Even the Elemental Kings were slow to
catch on, as they were focused on the out-of-control starlight mana.

Soon, an anomaly occurred.

*Kuuuuung!!!*

The sky trembled. No, The Abyss itself began to shudder.

At that moment, a terrifying amount of ice mana descended upon the area.

The Elemental Kings, the imperial knights, Headmistress Elena and the
faculty, and Dorothy and Luce felt chills run down their spines and
quickly looked up.

It was the moment that confirmed the survival of a man.

"Everyone, prepare to welcome him!"

Even the \[Blood Tree\] shield was insufficient to block Dorothy's mana.

Kaya endured the pain of her body twisting and her flesh tearing as she
stayed by Dorothy's side, rapidly healing her injuries with the power of
the plant element.

With a resolute face, she exclaimed,

"Sir Isaac will return...!"

*Isaac is alive. Thus, he will defeat the demon and return.*

Such a belief was reflected on Kaya's face.

It was four days ago.

It was after Isaac had been devoured by the Abyss while holding Alice
Carroll.

"...Baby?"

Alice slowly opened her eyes, feeling a sense of weightlessness.

She was being held in a princess carry by a man. Silver-blue hair filled
her vision.

"Are you awake?"

Isaac flashed Alice a gentle smile.

<span id="0216_218_Alice_Subjugation_14.xhtml"></span>

Chapter 218: Alice Subjugation (14)
===================================

I endlessly fell in the eternal prison alongside Alice.

I took a portable lamp out of my magic pouch and attached it to my
clothes. The light from the lamp brightened our surroundings.

Alice seemed to feel secure as I held her tightly.

However, she looked dazed, like she had just woken up from a deep sleep.
She looked dubious, wondering how she had come back to life.

I looked around. Something that looked like a giant planet was emitting
a chilling aura from a great distance.

Then, I looked in another direction. Alice’s head followed my gaze.

In the distance, a massive human head was visible. It was made of eerily
flowing dark mana, and its eyes and mouth were filled with pitch-black
darkness, making them appear hollow.

The human head figure had four heads stuck back to back, each facing
north, south, east, and west. It reminded me of Asura from Buddhist
mythology which I had come to know about in my previous life.

Those four heads attached together formed layers upon layers… forming a
column that stretched endlessly, with no end in sight above and below.

It was hazy.

Apart from that, there was only pure pitch-black darkness.

“What… is this place?”

“The inside of a demon’s belly.”

Alice’s eyes flickered briefly.

The demon, “Om the Eternal”, commonly known as the Abyss. This was his
world.

The Abyss, a demon sealed inside Snow White’s pocket watch, when
released from the seal, would devour any living being with mana it
encountered.

After it had eaten enough mana to satiate its voracity, it would pause
its feeding frenzy for a few days like a feast-and-famine predator.

In ❰Magic Knight of Märchen❱, after it had devoured Ian Fairytale, Snow
White, and other strong beings, it mimicked the starry sky and remained
still.

Ian couldn’t touch the Abyss without the Luminous Sword. The Abyss was
incredibly strong. Conversely, having the Luminous Sword meant that it
was possible to defeat this demon.

“Haa.”

Alice sighed and activated her telekinesis.

*Whoooong.*

*Tap.*

“Hmm?”

Our fall slowed down thanks to Alice’s telekinesis. Soon, we stepped on
something tangible that was formed midair.

It felt as if we were stepping on a crystal-clear glass floor. Beautiful
ripples of light spread out from the tips of my feet.

“It’s made with telekinesis.”

We were standing in the middle of a space without a floor.

“Ah…”

Alice’s legs gave out, and she collapsed right then and there.

I could roughly guess why. She must have remembered what happened before
being devoured by the Abyss and felt a tremendous sense of emptiness.

Alice took a deep breath, hugged her knees, and buried her head in them.

“Are you alright?”

“Yeah…”

The back of Alice’s shirt was torn, exposing her skin. Mephisto’s arm
had pierced through her clothing earlier.

I took off my cloak of disguise and draped it over Alice’s shoulders.
She showed no reaction as the navy blue robe covered her small back.

I set down the portable lamp I had fixed to my clothing and sat behind
Alice, with my back against hers. When I lowered my head, only
pitch-black darkness filled my sight.

This place was a bottomless eternal prison. If we didn’t do anything, we
would fall forever.

It was frightening. When I looked out at the vastness of the universe, I
felt a sense of emptiness upon realizing the insignificance of human
life. But thanks to the effect of \[Frozen Soul\], that emotion quickly
settled down.

Silence followed. It was suffocatingly quiet.

The sound of fabric rustling and faint breathing were the only things
filling the suffocating void.

In that uncomfortable silence, Alice eventually spoke up.

“Why didn’t I die, Baby?”

It was about time she asked.

Given Alice’s situation, it must have been bewildering. Whatever
happened, she was supposed to die.

I paused before responding.

“It seems like we’re forced to live forever here. Maybe that’s why.”

“I don’t understand… How can you say something like that so casually?”

“Because it’s true.”

“Yeah… I guess I can’t understand what an archwizard like you sees and
feels.”

Alice spoke in a subdued voice. There was no need to be entirely honest,
so I left her to think for herself.

Like I said, inside the Abyss’s body was a place that granted eternal
life.

Such was a place that could imprison living beings forever… for tens of
thousands, millions, and even billions of years. That was why it also
served as the backdrop for the bad ending 「Eternity」.

Creatures that lived for ages in this prison had eventually lost their
selves and their souls were taken by the Abyss, becoming the demon’s
eternal toys.

All of this was part of the transcendental powers of the demon, Abyss.

That was why I thought that entering the Abyss would allow Alice to
live.

Inflicting a fatal wound on Alice and turning her into a frozen human
was for that reason. Sending Mephisto away and getting devoured by the
Abyss was also part of the expected course.

It worked seeing as how Alice was alive and well.

I touched the scar on my cheek that I got while fighting Alice and
Zenon. It had healed completely, leaving only a trace of the wound.

Broken bones had also healed. It was a recovery speed that couldn’t be
attributed just to potions. It must have been thanks to the life force
provided by the Abyss.

The problem was mana.

I had used up a lot of mana during the fight against Zenon, Alice, and
Mephisto. Especially when I was in the Hunter state, using the Blade of
Frost Flowers required a significant amount of mana.

Of course, I still had plenty of mana left at that time, but the Abyss
ended up devouring much of it.

Alice was in a similar situation. Fortunately, it didn’t take much mana
to create tangible objects using telekinesis. Alice was incredibly
powerful after all.

This meant that the rate at which Alice’s mana was recovering was faster
than the rate at which it was being consumed to maintain this
transparent telekinetic object.

*I need to recover my mana quickly.*

For now, my sole focus should be on recovering my mana as soon as
possible.

The Abyss was on a mystical and transcendental level, higher than that
of an archwizard. It was stronger than the Floating Island and was one
of the highest-ranking demons, just below the Evil God.

“…”

In the silence, I could feel the gaze of the Abyss.

It was likely waiting for my mana to fully recover. It patiently awaited
our inevitable duel.

Seeing me now, not ready to fight, I must seem really unworthy and
tasteless. That was why it was just observing.

I wasn’t sure what it expected of me when I was fully ready, but I was
confident I could offer more than it expected.

Time passed and Alice broke the silence.

“In the end… it turned out like this.”

“Hmm?”

“I lost, and you got devoured by this demon with me… It was my fault so
only I should have been punished… It’s a bad ending for all of us.”

I didn’t bother to answer. I wanted her to reflect on her feelings of
guilt.

“…”

It quieted down again.

*…Maybe I should do some physical training.*

\*\*\*

“Baby.”

“Yeah.”

“Didn’t you find it strange that I call you ‘Baby’?”

“Not really, I didn’t think much of it.”

“I see…”

“...Now that you mention it, I’m curious. Why do you call me that?”

“It was just a nickname. I didn’t think much of it either.”

“Is that so…”

\*\*\*

“What are you thinking about?”

“Whether my people are okay or if they all died because of me.”

“I guess so…”

“...Aren’t you worried, Baby? There must be a lot of people worrying
about you right now.”

“I do worry. But there’s nothing I can do at the moment.”

“Yeah, that’s true.”

\*\*\*

“Baby, why are you waving your hand in the air like that?”

“Do you know what a status window is?”

“Huh…? What’s that?”

“It’s like a window of the mind that shows my current state. It’s
something that only I can see.”

“…”

“Don’t look at me like I’m some weirdo… I’m just kidding.”

\*\*\*

“You know what, Baby?”

“What?”

“I was actually a Queen. I had a kingdom that I ruled over. It’s a bit
far away though.”

“Wow, that’s really quite something.”

“...Your reaction is so underwhelming. What’s with the theatrical tone?”

\*\*\*

“Alice.”

“Yeah.”

“How do you think you would have lived if the demon hadn’t come?”

“Probably… peacefully in my kingdom. I don’t know if I would have met a
man I liked, but I think I would have lived quite comfortably.”

“...That’s unfortunate.”

“Don’t say that. I’m someone who’s only done bad things to you.”

\*\*\*

“You have more muscles than I thought, Baby?”

“Well, yeah.”

“But is there any point in working out here?”

“...Huh?”

\*\*\*

“Your goal was to defeat the Evil God… So you came to the Academy?”

“Something like that. I’m not yet skilled enough to defeat it yet.”

“Even someone as strong as you can’t defeat it, and here I was trying to
resurrect it…”

“...Remember that guilt.”

“…”

\*\*\*

“No muscle pain.”

“See.”

\*\*\*

“Can’t really feel the passage of time here, can you? I’m not even
sleepy.”

“It must be the demon’s power keeping us awake. It’s been about… two
days now.”

“Huh? How did you know?”

“I have a watch.”

“I see…”

\*\*\*

“I’m curious about something, Baby.”

“What is it?”

“Do you like Dorothy, Luce Eltania, or Kaya Astrea?”

“I like them all.”

“I meant romantically.”

“My answer is the same.”

“Really…?”

“That’s right.”

“Is the rumor that you’re a playboy true…?”

“It’s half true. Psychologically, it’s true.”

“Pfft… A psychological playboy…”

“What are you laughing at?”

“Just because, it’s unexpected. It’s really funny.”

“Is that so… that’s the first time you’ve laughed since we got here.”

“Yeah, that’s true. Thanks to you.”

\*\*\*

“It’s quite a romantic setting.”

“Why bring it up all of a sudden?”

“It feels like we’re the only two left in this isolated world.”

“Do you still think that after seeing those weird faces?”

“Baby is so strong yet so scared?”

\*\*\*

“Do you think we can get out of here?”

“I don’t know.”

\*\*\*

“I miss my mom and dad…”

“...What were they like?”

“It’s a boring story, do you want to hear it?”

“Yeah, tell me.”

“I should start from when I was young. I haven’t seen them since we
parted when I was little.”

\*\*\*

“You don’t have to pretend everything is okay. The people of your
kingdom, your subordinates, they’re all very worried about you.”

“Hee, that’s right… If only I wasn’t so weak, none of this would have
happened. I’ve only caused harm to you…”

“Honestly, I’m not sure if your kingdom still stands. It might be
irresponsible to say this, but I think… it might be okay.”

“Thank you for comforting me. Even though I’m your enemy.”

“We’re not like that anymore.”

“...Yeah.”

\*\*\*

*“Waaaaaah!!”*

*“Waaaaaah!!”*

*“Waaaaaah!!”*

*“Waaaaaah!!”*

\*\*\*

“Can I ask you something?”

“You don’t have to ask permission for that.”

“Really?”

“What do you want to know?”

“Did you really like me?”

“...Let me correct that. If you’re going to ask that kind of question,
ask permission first.”

\*\*\*

“Baby.”

“What?”

“This might sound strange, but thank you for being by my side.”

“...Is that so?”

\*\*\*

*Swoosh.*

I swiped away the status window with my finger.

While waiting for my mana to recover, Alice and I shared many stories we
had kept inside.

I remembered everything she had told me, and I vowed to never forget it,
even the most minor of details.

We started from different beginnings and met at a crossroads called
tragedy.

And fortunately, now I might be able to overturn that tragedy.

“So…”

My mana and condition were perfect.

Now I had to defeat the Abyss before it started feeding again.

Kaya, Luce, Dorothy, White… I was worried about them too. I wanted to
see them soon.

I stood up and walked forward, stepping on the tangible ground Alice had
created.

“Baby?”

“Get ready, we’re about to leave.”

“What do you mean…?”

I turned my head back to look at Alice and pointed upwards with one
finger.

Then, I answered calmly.

“I’m going to hunt this demon.”

Alice’s face stiffened like stone.

“What…?”

*You were serious when you said you were going to hunt this demon?*

Alice was confused, but she soon composed herself, knowing Isaac was not
one to joke about such matters.

After casting the protective spell \[Frost Barrier\] on Alice that
neutralized his own ice magic, Isaac turned his head towards the giant
pillar with human heads.

He gathered his mana. The gentle aura of \[Ice Sovereign\] rose from
Isaac, flowing like a river.

Isaac focused.

He intended to unleash the greatest firepower he had ever mustered in a
single burst.

*Screeeeech.*

The human heads all turned simultaneously, staring at Isaac with their
hollow eyes. The Abyss sensed his hostility.

Isaac simply looked back at it with a cold gaze.

\[**Kuhahahaha!!\]**

Suddenly, the human heads began to laugh grotesquely. The ear-splitting
laughter startled Alice, causing her to cover her ears.

The hollow mouth of the one directly in front of Isaac spat out a black
orb.

It floated in the air and transformed into a giant. The giant’s
pitch-black body was followed by mystical rings made of purple mana,
casting an alien halo that helped delineate its form.

It was adorned with ornaments made of various body parts of humans,
animals, magic beasts, and demons. They were made out of those who had
been devoured by the Abyss and lost their selves. The number was
countless.

Those turned into ornaments were still feeling vivid pain. The sight of
many creature heads that made up the giant’s necklace crying or drooling
seemed to heighten the terrifying stature of the giant.

The pitch-black giant spoke. A profound and deep male voice emanated.

\[**I’ve been waiting, Ice King.\]**

“You have my gratitude.”

Compared to the colossal pitch-black giant, Isaac, who was significantly
smaller, shrugged his shoulders and responded calmly.

The two beings had sensed each other’s intentions without words.

Alice couldn’t comprehend the situation at all.

“What in the world…?”

“He was waiting for me.”

When the Abyss devoured Isaac, it was delighted with the taste of his
mana, for it had never tasted anything so delicious.

However, the Isaac it had devoured suddenly changed to an indiscernible
level.

The Abyss greedily decided to devour Isaac’s mana once he was fully
restored, expecting it to be heavenly.

Moreover, Isaac was a man of great power. The Abyss was burning with
competitive spirit having such a formidable enemy in front of it.

All it needed was a brief moment.

A blink of an eye compared to the long years the Abyss had lived.

Thus, the Abyss chose to wait for Isaac, and Isaac understood its
intention.

“Let’s get this over with.”

Isaac finished stretching.

It was time to repay the Abyss’s anticipation.

*Kooooong!!*

Above them, an enormous iron gate of immeasurable size appeared.

Alice doubted her eyes when she saw the gate. It felt alien, as if it
wasn’t of this world, accompanied by an unfathomable amount of powerful
ice mana.

*Why did it suddenly appear… What could it possibly be?*

One thing was clear, the one who summoned the gate was Isaac.

Isaac slowly raised his right arm.

Then, in a calm tone, he murmured softly.

*– A life full of hardship.*

Chapter 219: Alice Subjugation (15)
===================================

*Hwaaaaa!*

Isaac exhaled an icy chill.

Following a low-pitched chant, a large number of pale blue magic circles
began to form behind him, stacking up like cogs.

The magic circles continued to build up, higher and higher.

Finally, a single gigantic magic circle encompassed all the others,
forming a trajectory in the air.

“Ack!”

Alice let out a short scream. The invisible floor couldn’t withstand
Isaac’s mana and it collapsed.

Isaac and Alice began to fall.

At that moment, Isaac extended his left hand to Alice.

Seeing this, Alice flinched. Isaac’s words echoed in her mind.

*– Still, don’t die.*

Alice grabbed his hand, and Isaac pulled her into his embrace. The
\[Frost Barrier\] enveloped them both.

A massive magic circle followed Isaac.

*Crackleeee!*

Isaac spread out three pairs of wings with the chill of \[Ice
Sovereign\] and hovered, glaring at the pitch-black giant.

*Whooooo!!!!*

Over Isaac’s outstretched right hand, pale blue cold air swirled and
gathered, forming a gigantic ice sun. It was an overwhelming show of
magic that even trivialized the caster, appearing as a mere insect in
its majesty.

Alice’s eyes widened at the wondrous sight.

*– And! Live beside me and atone. No matter how dangerous it gets, I’ll
fend it off.*

The 9-star ice spell, \[Cocytus\], formed in Isaac’s right hand.

Alice witnessed the world-ending magic she had only heard about in
stories for the first time in her life.

Meanwhile, the numerous human heads gathered purplish mana in their
mouths. The mana gradually condensed into a high-density sphere.

Simultaneously, the pitch-black giant deployed six massive dark magic
circles around him. Each magic circle produced fierce, jagged spheres of
darkness.

The power of the void, capable of annihilating even souls.

Each sphere was larger than the continent encompassing the Zelver
Empire. The size alone was a result of repeatedly compressed mana,
making them dangerous calamities.

In response, the blazing ice sun in Isaac’s right hand emitted a strong
radiance.

The world, shrouded in pitch-black darkness, gradually began to
brighten.

*Screech!*

A massive iron gate opened in the distance, releasing a cold that
embodied the absolute zero covering the abyss.

Inside the gate was a transcendental ice beast, unbound by life or
natural law.

When first summoned, it was suppressed by the laws of the Nether, but
here, there was no such restriction. This place was merely the
independent space of the Abyss, an eternal prison.

In other words, it could exert its full power.

From within the gate, a black monster with several red glowing eyes
grasped open the gate and revealed its humongous body.

\[**Kaaaaaaaa!!!\]**

Isaac’s minion, the Primordial Beast of Ice, Daikan, let out a roar that
echoed through the Abyss.

Alice’s eyes trembled.

*What kind of being did Isaac have as a minion?*

Alice could hardly believe the existence of such a creature, even as she
witnessed it firsthand.

The sheer mana emanating from Isaac and Daikan began to warp the very
space around them.

The pitch-black giant laughed eerily and shouted joyfully at the sight.

\[**Excellent! Not even during my wanderings through the distant skies
did I encounter an adversary like you!\]**

Inside the Abyss, the life that had passed in what seemed like an
eternity was meaningless to look back on. It was all just emptiness.

He was too strong. Thus, he decided to seal himself until the day the
Evil God, Nephid, resurrected and entrusted everything to Mephisto.

And upon awakening, he met this human.

Since a very distant past, now forgotten, the Abyss had longed to face
an opponent so strong that even his immortal life felt threatened.

Now that wish had come true.

How exhilarating to feel such excitement after countless years. How
could he contain this boiling fighting spirit?

\[**My name is Om!\]**

The Abyss wanted to know the name of the one who brought him this
feeling.

\[**What is thy name?\]**

Isaac answered in a calm voice.

“Isaac.”

\[**Ice King, Isaac. At the end of this battle, such a name will forever
be immortalized in my memory.\]**

Isaac and the 9-star ice spell \[Cocytus\], along with the
transcendental ice beast Daikan, filled the nothingness of the Abyss
with their chill.

Though the Abyss was made of an eternal prison, even that demon had
limits as a living being.

No one had ever surpassed the Abyss’s limits, which was why he had
remained “Eternal”.

To defeat the Abyss, it was necessary to unleash a force that could
surpass his power and distort the very laws of nature.

*Kwaaaang!!!*

The pitch-black giant and the columns of human heads simultaneously
fired beams of purplish mana with the power of the void.

“Me too… I’ll remember you.”

Isaac murmured as he watched the Abyss’s attack fill his view with no
escape, then swung his right hand to unleash the ice sun \[Cocytus\].

At the same time, the Primordial Beast of Ice, Daikan, fired the
extremely cold mana from its mouth.

At the moment of collision.

Isaac’s coldness swallowed even sound, drowning everything else out, and
the pitch-black giant was enveloped in an immense light in the midst of
stillness.

Feeling the extreme cold and the sensation of dying, a satisfied smile
spread across the pitch-black giant’s lips.

Having thought he would never die, he poured all his strength into
battling the Ice King and achieved a glorious defeat.

\[**What a wonderful death…!\]**

The Abyss vanished.

The countless souls he had imprisoned regained their freedom.

*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!!!!!!*

The body of the Abyss, riddled with holes, allowed cold sunlight to pour
through the gaps.

A thunderous roar echoed across the sky, accompanied by a grand icy
explosion that enveloped the starry sky.

The chilling cold spread gently.

And then.

Against the backdrop of the dazzling explosion in the sky, a young man
descended, holding a woman with light gold hair in his arms.

Everyone witnessed this scene.

Emperor Carlos, who had been observing Märchen Academy from somewhere
nearby with the help of an Imperial wizard.

The students and staff who had evacuated, as well as Snow White and her
escort knights.

The Subjugation Force traversing Märchen Academy.

Saintess Bianca and her loyal follower, Sylon.

The people gathered in Märchen Academy square.

*Screech!*

*Boom!*

The iron gate, which was almost already closed, shut firmly with a
resounding noise.

Beyond the icy explosion was a huge iron gate that seemed to have no
end.

The Emperor and the Elemental Kings recognized the Primordial Magic
Beast residing beyond that gate.

The rest were filled with questions about what it was, along with
feelings of awe and fear.

The only certainty was that the massive iron gate was the result of the
power of the young man with silver-blue hair falling from the sky.

As the gate faded into the sky like a mirage, the true night sky
revealed itself.

The ice beasts guarding the island roared in a triumphant chorus.

The Düpfendorf army kneeled on one knee in reverence.

\[**Behold.\]**

The commander of Düpfendorf’s knights extended his frosted silver sword
towards the sky, addressing his knights.

\[**The great one who has driven away the demon of the night sky and
brought forth light.\]**

Through the moniker of the Black Monster, he was called the Nameless
Hero.

He was reborn as the Ice Sovereign and the Ice Elemental King.

\[**He is our new King.\]**

The Ice Sovereign, Isaac.

This was the moment he reappeared after defeating the Abyss.

“Isaac…?”

“Sir Isaac!!”

Luce’s astonished cry and Kaya’s joyous shout echoed.

Isaac noticed the many people gathered in the Academy Square.

He wanted to adjust his descent using the momentum of \[Frostfire\], but
he couldn’t. His mana was completely exhausted after defeating the
Abyss.

“Alice, help us land in the square.”

“Okay…”

Alice, still in Isaac’s arms, couldn’t believe what had just happened,
but she nodded with a relieved expression.

*What an extraordinary man.*

She thought, feeling a deep sense of admiration.

Alice’s telekinesis gently guided them to a safe landing in the middle
of the Academy Square.

Thus, Isaac and Alice landed next to Dorothy, Luce, and Kaya.

The Abyss disintegrated into gray dust, and the remnants of pale blue
mana fell like gentle snowflakes. The mana was so dense that even its
remnants didn’t disappear easily.

The people gathered in the square had never seen such a beautiful sight
of mana remnants falling like snow.

Luce was at a loss for words, her throat tight, as she saw Isaac, who
had defeated the demon in the starry sky, return.

Kaya gazed at Isaac with sparkling eyes, tears welling up at the
corners. She was relieved that Isaac had returned safely.

Dorothy’s eyes widened as Isaac came into view. A profound sense of
relief washed over her, and her starlight mana gradually regained
stability.

“Huh…?”

The hallucination of someone pulling her hand vanished as if the grip
had been released.

Dorothy used the power of \[All in the World\] to identify the
multiple-eyed unknown entity lurking within Isaac’s essence, and she
realized it was growling.

*Chararang…*

The rampaging starlight mana calmed down as if it had been a lie.
Dorothy concluded that the unknown entity within Isaac had resolved it.

*How? More importantly, why?*

She couldn’t fathom the reason.

The four Paladins who had been floating around Dorothy collapsed to the
ground, gasping for air and clutching their throats.

“What on earth happened…?”

The four Elemental Kings, the Imperial Knights, Thunderbird Galia,
Headmistress Elena, the faculty, the Tower Master of Hegel, Aria, and…
the strongest subjugation force in the Empire, who had arrived at the
Academy Square briefly and witnessed the rampaging starlight mana, all
showed shocked expressions.

The appearance of Isaac had caused the starlight mana that was
distorting the surrounding terrain to subside.

Those who witnessed this scene could only conclude that Isaac had
somehow resolved Dorothy’s mana outburst with an unknown power.

“…”

Despite the large crowd gathered in the square, a heavy silence hung in
the air.

Isaac saw Dorothy, Luce, and Kaya’s faces and swallowed a gasp.

They looked terrible. Isaac felt a tightening pain in his chest.

He gently set Alice down and surveyed the surroundings with chilling,
cold eyes.

Many structures were warped by starlight mana. Multiple craters marked
the area.

The four Elemental Kings and the Imperial Knights were facing off
against Dorothy, Luce, and Kaya.

Although he couldn’t fully grasp what had happened, he could grasp the
general picture.

There must have been a justified reason for this situation. Isaac
understood that much.

But, no matter how much he tried… he couldn’t suppress his rising anger.

The forces of this world were trying to harm those he cared for?

“What… do you think you’re all doing?”

Isaac asked, trying to restrain his emotions.

Yet his icy tone seemed to freeze the Academy Square.

On the outskirts of the island, the disaster-level ice beasts sensed
their master’s reaction and displayed hostility towards those gathered
in the square.

By now, a part of Düpfendorf’s army had surrounded the square, and the
top-ranked soldiers formed up behind Isaac, exuding a chilling aura.

Although the movements of the Düpfendorf soldiers were unexpected, Isaac
didn’t mind. He needed to demonstrate his authority from now on.

The Subjugation Force and the Imperial Knights swallowed hard.

Isaac’s displayed emotions seemed like hostility. It felt like a warning
not to cross the line any further, or there would be consequences.

The silver-blue-haired boy who had returned after defeating the mighty
demon that had surrounded the sky, the Ice Sovereign… they realized they
couldn’t recklessly oppose him. Even a flick of his finger could turn
the area into ruins.

Such was the vast disparity in power between the Ice Sovereign and
themselves, the Subjugation Force and the Imperial Knights concluded
with cold rationality.

As the silence continued, Isaac walked forward alone.

The Lightning King, the Lightning Sovereign, Jaul Dragoniac, watched
Isaac with sharp eyes.

The Fire King, the Fire Sovereign, Andersen Versando, regarded Isaac
solemnly.

The Water King, the Water Sovereign, Siren Silivian, smirked at Isaac.

The Wind King, the Wind Sovereign, Erin Campbell, blankly gazed at
Isaac.

With Isaac at the center of it all, a thick tension enveloped the
Academy Square.
